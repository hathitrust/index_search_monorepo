        between producers and consumers
        * exchange_name: The name of the main exchange to declare.
        * dlx_exchange: The name of the dead-letter exchange to declare.
        * exchange_type: The type of the exchange (default is 'direct').
        * durable: Whether the queue and exchanges are durable (default is True).
            durable=True - the queue will survive a broker restart
        * auto_delete: Whether the queue and exchanges are auto-deleted (default is False)
            auto_delete=False - the queue won't be deleted once the consumer is disconnected
        * arguments: Additional arguments for the queue, such as dead-letter exchange and routing key.
            the dead-letter-exchange and dead-letter-routing-key are used to define the dead letter exchange
            and the routing key to use when a message is dead-lettered
        * batch_size: The maximum number of unacknowledged deliveries that are permitted on
        the channel (default is 1).
