Where the controversy arises re- specting a claim to an estate in real property, in fee or for life. But where a person, capable of en- tering into a submission, has knowingly entered into the same with a person capable of so doing, as prescribed in subdivision first of this section, the objection on the ground of incapacity, can be taken only in behalf of the per- son so incapacitated. And the second division of this section does not pre- vent the submission of a claim to an estate for years, or other interest for a term of years, or for one year or less, in real property; or of a controversy respecting the partition of real property between joint tenants or tenants in com- mon; or of a controversy respecting the boundaries of lands, or the admeasure- ment of dower.

M. FELDMAN, Consulting Engineer. The widespread interest in the campaign against tuberculosis, which has grown so rapidly in the last few years, has served but to publish the fact that one of the most important predisposed factors to tuberculosis and other diseases of the throat and lungs, is bad air. Foul air is caused by the absence of ventilation, or through faulty ventilation. Another fact which has been developed during this same campaign, is that not only is the health greatly improved, and the power of resistance of the body against disease greatly strengthened by breathing pure air, but much more efficient work is being done by those studying and working in well-ventilated rooms. The plea for good ventilation then may be based upon two points: 1. 2. Preservation of health. Prevention of sickness and death. Economy-increase in efficiency. The usual excuse for not having a scientific system of ventilation in build- ings is its cost. But if upon it depend lives, if workers, whether those whose brains or whose bodies are serving, can accomplish so much more, is not its lack a flagrant instance of economic shortsightedness? In a factory, a work-shop, or a store badly ventilated much less efficient work will be done by workers. Valuable time will be lost on account of sickness among the employes who will be rendered susceptible to many germ diseases. &amp;quot;The removal of the offices of the U. S. Pension Bureau from scattered and poorly ventilated buildings to new and well ventilated quarters reduced the num- ber of days of absence due to illness, from 18,736, in the neighborhood of which figure it had been for several successive years, to 10,114.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;In an investigation of conditions in the operating room of the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company, at Cambridge, Mass., it was found that before the installation of a ventilating system, 49 per cent. of the force (50 to 60 girls) were absent during the winter months of 1906, and 4.5 per cent. in 1907. The ventilating duct which was put in was a simple one, and in the winter of 1908, following its introduction, the absences were cut down to 1.9 per cent. of the force employed, without any other changes in conditions or personnel.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;In the printing establishment of C. J. O&apos;Brien, in New York, a ventilating system was installed because of the insistence of the State Department of Labor, that the law be complied with, the order having been resisted for two years. After the system had been in use a year the proprietor stated that had he known in advance of the results to be obtained, no order would have been necessary to have brought about the installation. Whereas formerly the men had left their work on busy days in an exhausted condition, and sickness was common, now the men left their work on all days in an entirely different condition, and sickness is very rare.&amp;quot; I was informed by the members of the New York Linen, Supply and Laundry Company, in whose new building at 326, 328 and 330 East 32d Street, New York, a complete ventilating system was installed by the speaker, that owing to the arduous character of laundry work, and the oppressive conditions of temper- ature and humidity under which such work must ordinarily be done, and the price paid for such work, it is a common experience for those operating laundries to be annoyed by continued change of help, so that 50 per cent. of the help may change within a period of a few months or within a year at the outside. Whereas in the laundry above referred to by exhausting the steam and vapor at the source from over the mangles and washers, and introducing a sufficient supply of tempered fresh air, the temperature and humidity gives so much comfort to the help that they have found the laundry a pleasant place to work in, and the attendance has been quite regular. The change in this laundry has been less than 5 per cent. so that the company has not been under the necessity of expense of &quot; &quot;216 Labor Law teen hundred and fifteen, be completely removed and the place where they were located properly disinfected under the direction of the department. 4. Every water-closet installed before October first, nineteen hundred and fourteen, inside any mercantile establishment, shall have a basin of enameled iron earthenware, and shall be flushed from a separate water-supplied cistern or through a proper valve connected in such manner as to keep the water supply of the establishment free from contamination. 5. All woodwork enclosing water-closet fixtures shall be removed from the front of the closet and the space underneath the seat shall be left open. All water-closet compartments or toilet rooms constructed before October first, nine- teen hundred and fourteen, shall have windows opening directly to the outer air or shall be otherwise properly ventilated to the outer air by suitable ducts, and shall be provided with means for artificial illumination. Sec. 168-f. Ventilation. Every mercantile establishment shall be provided with proper and sufficient means of ventilation by natural or mechanical means, or both, as may be necessary, and there shall be maintained therein proper and sufficient ventilation and proper degrees of temperature and humidity at all times during working hours. The Industrial Board shall make rules for and fix stan- dards of ventilation, temperature and humidity in mercantile establishments. [Added by L. 1914, Chap. 183.

Specifications TROEGERLITH COMPOSITION FLOORING TSPECIFICATIONS have been designed with the idea of rendering specifications for Cork Composition, and Composition Flooring more uniform, and to cover certain very necessary points in regard to the proper installations of Troegerlith floors that are often overlooked when writing these specifications. The Troegerlith Specifications contain the correct methods, and instructions how Troegerlith Composition should be laid. If the architects use these specifications there can be but one interpre- tation placed upon his instructions, which if followed out by the contractor insures a perfect composition floor in every respect.

In general use for most purposes. Selected Glazing. For high-class residences and showcases. Silvering Quality. Nearly perfect for mirror use. Thickness. Practically all plate glass is manufactured in commercial thick- ness, between seven-thirty-seconds and five-sixteenths of an inch. Plates contain- ing over seventy-five square feet should be at least one-quarter inch thick, and plates containing over one hundred square feet should be one-quarter inch full in thickness at the thinnest point. Plate glass, however, is also manufactured in thickness from one-eighth to one and one-half inches. Sizes. The greatest width in plate glass is one hundred and sixty-four inches. The greatest length is two hundred and sixty inches. A plate containing over two hundred and forty square feet means that a light of plate glass from one hundred and sixty to one hundred and sixty-four inches in width should not be more than from two hundred and ten to two hundred and sixteen inches in length. One one hundred and forty-four inches in width should not be over two hundred and forty inches in length, and one two hundred and sixty inches in length should not be over one hundred and thirty inches in height. Mirrors. It is usual to specify that mirrors shall be made from silvering quality plate glass, and particular attention must be paid to the selection of the glass so as to give it as true and straight a reflection as is possible. For the backs of show windows and other similar purposes a very good qual- ity of mirror is secured at a lower cost by specifying a mirror made from selected glazing. CYLINDER GLASS The different designations in the trade for cylinder glass and weights to square foot and number of lights to the inch are: Single Strength. Fourteen to sixteen ounce to square foot, or approximately thirteen lights to the inch one-thirteenth inch thick. Double Strength. Nineteen to twenty-one ounces to square foot, or approx- imately eight lights to the inch one-eighth inch thick. Twenty-six Ounce. Twenty-five to twenty-seven ounces to square foot, or approximately seven and one-half lights to the inch two-fifteenths inch thick. Thirty-two Ounce. Thirty-one to thirty-three ounces to square foot, or approximately seven lights to the inch one-seventh inch thick. Thirty-six Ounce. Thirty-five to thirty-seven ounces to square foot, or approximately six lights to the inch one-sixth inch thick. First Quality is selected, must be as flat as possible and contain no blisters over one-eighth inch, strings or cords or stone. This glass must not be burnt nor contain sulphur marks. Second Quality may contain small blisters, a few strings and small stones. It must not be burnt and shall have no large sulphur stains. Third Quality may contain any three of the above defects, but no more. All cylinder glass is wavy and is never perfectly flat. It should always be glazed with the convex side on the outside. PRISM GLASS Three forms of prism glass are commonly used for vertical setting, namely: 1. (A) Ordinary Rolled Sheet Prism Glass, which is manufactured in sheets from forty-two to sixty inches high, and in maximum width one hundred inches. It is adapted for use in warehouses, factories, school buildings, and in places where an ornamental appearance is not required. (B) Ordinary Rolled Sheet Prism Set in Hard Metal, made up in orna- mental designs, of which there are several geometrical stock patterns. 2. Tile Prisms are pressed from the best quality of glass and made in sev- eral angles to suit various light conditions. Manufactured in four, five and six inch squares, set in hard metal, electro copper plated, zinc, solid copper or any metal finish desired. &quot; &quot;88 Building Code and the said gallery.

All stairs shall have proper landings introduced at convenient distances. All in- closed staircases shall have, on both sides, strong hand-rails firmly secured to the wall about three inches distant therefrom and about three feet above the stairs, but said hand-rails shall not run on level platforms and landings where the same is more in length than the width of the stairs. All staircases eight feet and over in width shall be provided with a centre hand-rail of metal, not less than two inches in diameter, placed at a height of about three feet above the centre of the treads, and supported on wrought metal or brass standards of sufficient strength, placed not nearer than four feet or more than six feet apart, and securely bolted to the treads or risers of stairs, or both, and at the head of each flight of stairs, on each landing, the post or standard shall be at least six feet in height, to which the rail shall be secured.

Wherever an outer court changes its initial horizontal direction, or wherever any part of such court extends in a direction so as not to receive direct light from the street or yard, the length of such portion of said court shall never exceed the width of said portion; such length to be measured from the point at which the change of direction commences. Wherever an outer court is less in depth than the minimum width prescribed by this article, then its width may be equal to, but not less than its depth, provided that such width is never less than four feet in the clear. This exception shall also apply to each offset or recess in outer courts. And no window except windows of water-closet compartments, bath- rooms or halls shall open upon any offset or recess less than six feet in width. Sec. 58. (Inner Courts.)-1. Where one side of an inner court is situated on the lot line, the width of the said court measured from the lot line to the opposite wall of the build- ing, for tenement houses sixty feet in height shall not be less than twelve feet in any part and its other horizontal dimensions shall not be less than twenty-four feet in any part; and for every twelve feet of increase or fraction thereof in the height of the said building, such width shall be in- creased six inches throughout the entire height of said court, and the other horizontal dimension shall be increased one foot throughout the entire height of said court; and for every twelve feet of decrease in the height of the said building below sixty feet, such width may be decreased six inches and the other horizontal dimension may be decreased one foot.

That in choosing a type of roofing, the thing most desirable is to secure the lowest unit cost-i. e. the lowest cost per foot per year of service. 2. That the roofing of lowest unit cost is a pitch, felt and slag or gravel roof-if it is laid right. 3. That the way to get it laid right is to incorporate The Barrett Specification verbatim in your building specifica- tions. 4. That a Barrett Specification roof will usually last twenty years or more. 5. That during that time it does not have to be painted or tinkered with or cared for. 6. That the first cost of a Barrett Specifica- tion roof is less than that of any other permanent roofing. 7. That it is the most economical and satis- factory roofing known for all kinds of permanent structures, such as Manu- facturing Plants, Railroad Buildings, Skyscrapers, Business Blocks, Hotels, Apartment and Dwelling Houses.

Lots from to street. street Measurements, at 2d tier, at ground level. bath-rooms or water-closets. Nothing in this section shall be construed so as to prevent the erection of an extension to a wooden building, within the fire limits, if such extension is constructed with walls of brick, stone, iron or other hard, incombustible material, provided that the top of the roof beams of such extension shall not be above the level of the second tier of beams, and further provided that such extension shall not be occupied or arranged to be occupied for living purposes. Sec. 39. (Combustible Materials.)-No tenement house, nor any part thereof, nor of the lot upon which it is situated, shall be used as a place of storage, keeping or handling of any combustible article except under such conditions as may be prescribed by the fire department, under authority of a writ- ten permit issued by said department. No tenement house, nor any part thereof, nor of the lot upon which it is situated, shall be used as a place of storage, keeping or handling of any article dangerous or detrimental to life or health, nor for the storage, keeping or handling of feed, hay, straw, excelsior, cotton, paper stock, feathers or rags. Sec. 40. (Bakeries and Fat Boiling.)-No bakery and no place of business in which fat is boiled, shall be maintained in any tenement house which is not fireproof throughout, unless the ceiling, side-walls, and all exposed iron or wooden girders or columns within the said bakery or within said place where fat boiling is done, are made safe by fireproof materials around the same. And there shall be no openings either by door or window, dumbwaiter shafts or otherwise, between said bakery or said place where fat is boiled in any tenement house, and the other parts of the said building, except that in bakeries in which no fat is boiled, and in which no apparatus for fat boiling is present or on the premises, a dumbwaiter communi- cating between the place where the baking is done and the store above, may be maintained, if entirely inclosed in a brick shaft with walls not less than eight inches thick, without any openings whatever except one door opening in the bake-shop and one door opening in the bakery store; such openings shall each be provided with a fireproof door so arranged that when one door is open or partly open, the other door shall be entirely closed. Sec. 41. (Other Dangerous Businesses.)-All transoms and windows opening into halls from any portion of a tene- ment house where paint, oil, spirituous liquors or drugs are stored for the purpose of sale or otherwise, shall be glazed with wire-glass or they shall be removed and closed up as solidly as the rest of the wall; and all doors leading into any such hall from such portion of said house shall be made fireproof. ARTICLE IV. LIGHT AND VENTILATION. Sec. 50. (Percentage of Lot Occupied.)-No tenement house hereafter erected shall occupy, either alone or with other buildings, except as otherwise provided in section fifty- eight, subdivisions one and two of this chapter, a greater per- centage of the area of the lot than as follows: (a) In the case of a corner lot not more than ninety per centum; (b) In the case of an interior lot which exceeds ninety feet in depth and does not exceed one hundred and five feet in depth, not more than seventy per centum; (c) In the case of an interior lot which exceeds one hun- dred and five feet in depth, not more than sixty-five per centum; Provided that the space occupied by fire-escapes of the size hereinbefore prescribed shall not be deemed a part of the lot occupied. For the purposes of this section the measurements shall be taken at the ground level, except that where such a building has no basement, and the cellar ceiling is not more than two feet above the curb level, the measurements as to &quot; &quot;Building Code 63 proper piers or buttresses, shall have the side or bearing walls increased in thickness four inches more than is specified in the respective sections of this Code for the thickness of walls for every one hundred and five feet, or part thereof, that the said buildings are over one hundred and five feet in depth. Sec. 34. (Reduced Thickness for Interior Walls.) In case the walls of any buildings are less than twenty-five feet apart, and less than forty feet in depth, or there are cross walls which intersect the walls, not more than forty feet distant, or piers of buttresses built into the walls, the interior walls may be reduced in thickness in just proportion to the number of cross walls, piers or buttresses, and their nearness to each other; provided, how- ever, that this clause shall not apply to walls below sixty feet in height, and that no such wall shall be less than twelve inches thick at the top and gradually increased in thickness by set-offs to the bottom. DISCRETION OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.-The Commissioner of Build- ings having jurisdiction is hereby authorized and empowered to decide (except where herein otherwise provided for) how much the walls herein mentioned may be permitted to be reduced in thickness, according to the peculiar circumstances of each case, without endangering the strength and safety of the building. Sec. 35. (One-Story Brick Buildings.) THICKNESSES OF WALLS.-Walls of brick built in between iron or steel fifteen feet may be built with eight-inch walls when the bearing walls are not more than nineteen feet apart, and the length of the eight-inch bearing walls does not exceed fifty-five feet. One-story and basement extensions may be built with eight-inch walls when not over twenty feet wide, twenty feet deep and twenty feet high to dwellings. Sec. 36. (Inclosure Walls for Skeleton Structures.) THICKNESSES OF WALLS.-Walls of brick built in between iron or steel columns, and supported wholly or in part on iron or steel girders shall be not less than twelve inches thick for seventy-five feet of the uppermost height thereof or to the nearest tier of beams to that measurement, in any building so con- structed and every lower section of sixty feet, or to the nearest tier of beams to such vertical measurement, or part thereof, shall have a thickness of four inches more than is required for the section next above it down to the tier of beams nearest to the curb level; and thence downward, the thickness of walls shall increase in the ratio prescribed in section 26, this code. Sec 37. (Curtain Walls.) THICKNESSES OF WALLS.- -Curtain walls built in between piers or iron or steel columns and not supported on steel or iron girders, shall be not less than twelve inches thick for sixty feet of the uppermost height thereof, or nearest tier of beams to that height and increased four inches for every additional section of sixty feet or nearest tier of beams to that height. Sec. 38. (Existing Party Walls.) Walls heretofore built for or used as party walls, whose thickness at the time of their erection was in accordance with the requirements of the then existing laws, but which are not in accordance with the requirements of this code, may be used, if in good condition, for the ordinary uses of party walls, provided the height of the same be not increased. Sec. 39. (Lining Existing Walls.) INDEPENDENT AND PARTY WALLS.-In case it is desired to increase the height of existing party or independent walls, which are less in thickness than required under this code, the same shall be done by a lining of brickwork to form a combined thickness with the old wall of not less than four inches more than the thickness required for a new wall corresponding with the total height of the wall when so increased in height. FOUNDATION WALLS.-The said linings shall be supported on proper foun- dations and carried up to such a height as the Commissioner of Buildings having jurisdiction may require. No lining shall be less than eight inches in thickness, and all lining shall be laid up in cement mortar and thoroughly anchored to the old brick walls with suitable wrought-iron anchors, placed two feet apart and properly fastened or driven into the old walls in rows alternating vertically and horizontally with each other, the old walls being first cleaned of plaster or other coatings where any lining is to be built against the same. No rubble wall shall be lined except after inspection and approval by the department. &quot; &quot;22 Architects-New York City BROOKLYN. Adelsohn, Edward M., 1776 Pitkin av.

Where such air shaft is covered by a skylight, the net open- ings at the top must be at least twice the required area of the shaft. Rule 133. When any toilet-room here- after installed, opening on an airshaft, contains more than eight fixtures (water closets or urinals) means for mechan- ical ventilation must be supplied and maintained SO that the air shall be changed not less than eight times an hour. Rule 134. Every existing toilet-room or water-closet compartment must be ventilated to the outer air by window, skylight or duct. Rule 135. Whenever any existing toilet-room having more than two fix- tures (water-closets or urinals) is ven- tilated solely by duct, or whenever the window or skylight area is one-third less than the area required in future in- stallations, mechanical ventilation creat- ing eight changes of air per hour must be maintained, discharging at such point as not to cause offense to the occupant of the building or any other building. Rule 136. Every window or skylight must be so constructed and maintained as to be easily opened at least one-half (2) its area. (Note. Except when the outside tem- perature is below 32 degrees Fahren- heit, windows or skylights should be kept partially open at all times during working hours, and supplied with a practical device to deflect drafts.) Rule 137. Light.-Every toilet-room or water-closet compartment must be so lighted that all parts of the room or compartment are easily visible at all times during working hours. If day- light is not sufficient for this purpose, artificial illumination must be main- tained. The approaches to all water- closets and privies must be kept well lighted and free from encumbrances. DRINKING WATER, WASHROOMS AND DRESSING ROOMS. Sec. 88. Rule 138. Drinking Water. Drinking water must be supplied at all times in places accessible to employes, and must be cold. Rule 139. The use of a common glass or cup is prohibited. When sanitary drinking fountains are supplied, they must be so constructed that a person must drink from a stream or jet of water. Rule 140. Washrooms, Location.-Un- less the general washing facilities are on the same floor and in close proximity to the toilet-room, there must be at least one wash-basin in such room or ad- jacent thereto. (It is recommended that in new in- stallations the general washing facili- ties be located in close proximity to the toilet-rooms, and in no case more than one floor above or below the place of work of the persons using same.) Rule 141. Number. At least one wash-basin with faucet must be supplied for every fifteen employees. Twenty inches of sink will be considered equiv- alent to one basin. Rule 142. Every wash-basin or sink hereafter installed must be made of vitrified glazed earthenware, enameled iron or other light colored glazed mate- rial impervious to water. Rule 143. Light. - All basins and sinks must be so lighted that all parts are easily visible at all times during working hours. If daylight is not suf- ficient for this purpose, artificial illumi- nation must be maintained. Rule 144. Towels.-The use of any towel or towels in common is prohibited. Rule 145. Ash Cans.-Fireproof re- ceptables for used paper towels must be provided. Rule 146. Floors.- All floors under basins and sinks must be kept in good repair. Rule 147.-Floor Area. The floor area of dressing-rooms must be as fol- lows: For less than ten (10) females, at least sixty (60) square feet; for more than ten (10) and less than a hundred (100), two and one-half (22) square feet additional for every additional per- son; for more than a hundred (100) two (2) square feet additional for every ad- ditional person. Note. In case an emergency room is provided in addition to the dressing- room or in case the floor area provided in toilet and washrooms is more than the required amount, a proportionate reduction in floor area or dressing- rooms may be made by the Commis- sioner of Labor. (It is recommended that separate dressing-rooms should be provided on more than one floor of every factory, and that they be located in close prox- imity to the toilet-rooms.) Rule 148. Construction. The walls or partitions of every dressing-room must be of solid construction and must be at least seven (7) feet high. Translu- cent glass may be inserted in such walls. Rule 149. Ventilation.—Every dress- ing-room must have at least one win- dow or skylight opening directly to the outer air or open air shaft, which must be so constructed and maintained as to be easily opened at least one-half of its area. If the dressing-room is enclosed by walls extending to the ceiling such window must be not less than one (1) foot in height and of an area of at least five (5) square feet or skylight of the &quot; &quot;94 Building Code two times the least thickness of the outside member. All holes shall be punched accurately, so that upon assembling a cold rivet will enter the hole without strain- ing the material by drifting. Occasional slight errors shall be corrected by ream- ing. The rivets shall fill the holes completely; the heads shall be hemispherical and concentric with the axis of the rivet. Gussets shall be provided wherever required, of sufficient thickness and size to accommodate the number of rivets necessary to make a connection. Sec. 124. (Bolting of Structural Steel and Wrought Iron Work.) Where riveting is not made mandatory connections may be effected by bolts. These bolts shall be of wrought iron or mild steel, and they shall have U. S. Standard threads. The threads shall be full and clean, the nut shall be truly concentric with the bolt, and the thread shall be of sufficient length to allow the nut to be screwed up tightly. When bolts go through bevel flanges, level washers to match shall be used so that head and nut of bolt are parrallel. When bolts are used for suspenders, the working stresses shall be reduced for wrought iron to ten thousand pounds and for steel to fourteen thousand pounds per square inch of net area, and the load shall be transmitted into the head or nut by strong washers distributing the pressure evenly over the entire surface of the same. Turned bolts in reamed holes shall be deemed a substitute for field rivets. Sec. 125. (Steel and Wrought Iron Trusses.) Trusses shall be of such design that the stresses in each member can be calculated. All trusses shall be held rigidly in position by efficient systems of lateral and sway bracing, struts being spaced so that the maximum limit of length to least radius of gyration, established in section one hundred and eleven of this code, is not exceeded. Any member of a truss subjected to transverse stress, in addition to direct tension or compression, shall have the stresses causing such strain added to the direct stresses coming on the member, and the total stresses thus formed shall in no case exceed the working stresses stated in section one hun- dred and thirty-nine of this code. Sec. 126. (Riveted Steel and Wrought Iron Trusses.) For tension members, the actual net area only, after deducting rivet holes, one-eighth inch larger than the rivets, shall be considered as resisting the stress. If tension members are made of angle irons riveted through one flange only, only that flange shall be considered in proportioning areas. Rivets to be proportioned as prescribed in section one hundred and twenty-three of this code. If the axis of two adjoining web members do not intersect within the line of the chords, sufficient area shall be added to the chord to take up the bending strains. No bolts shall be used in the connections of riveted trusses, excepting when riveting is impracticable, and then the holes shall be drilled or reamed. Sec. 127. (Steel and Iron Pin-Connected Trusses.) The bending stresses on pins shall be limited to twenty thousand pounds for steel and fifteen thousand pounds for iron. All compression members in pin- connected trusses shall be proportioned, using seventy-five per cent. of the per- missible working stress for columns. The heads of all eye-bars shall be made by upsetting or forging. No weld will be allowed in the body of the bar. Steel eye- bars shall be annealed. Bars shall be straight before boring. All pin-holes shall be bored true, and at right angles to the axis of the members, and must fit the pin within one-thirty-second of an inch. The distance of pin-holes from centre to centre for corresponding members shall be alike, so that, when piled upon one another, pins will pass through both ends without forcing. Eyes and screw ends shall be so proportioned that upon test to destruction, fracture will take place in the body of the member. All pins shall be accurately turned. Pin-plates shall be provided wherever necessary to reduce the stresses on pins to the working stresses prescribed in section one hundred and thirty-nine of this code. These pin-plates shall be connected to the members by rivets of sufficient size and number to transmit the stresses without exceeding working stresses. All rivets in members of pin-connected trusses shall be machine driven. All rivets in pin- plates which are necessary to transmit stress shall be also machine driven. The main connection of members shall be made by pins. Other connections may be made by bolts. If there is a combination of riveted and pin-connected members in one truss, these members shall comply with the requirements for pin-connected trusses; but the riveting shall comply with the requirements of section one hun- dred and twenty-six of this code. &quot; &quot;98 Building Code With Across grain. grain.

Right to Survey. Sec. 777. The owner, lessee or occupant of any building, structure, vessel, enclosure, place or premises affected by any order of the department, or his agent, may make written demand upon the commissioner for a survey of such building, structure, vessel, enclosure, place or premises to determine whether or not such order is valid and reasonable, which demand for survey must be served upon the commissioner or one of his deputies, or a member of the uniformed force of the department, if personal service cannot be made upon the commissioner or one of his deputies, within forty-eight hours, Sundays and holidays excluded, after the service of the order referred to in such demand. A demand for survey served upon a deputy commissioner or a member of the uniformed force of the department shall be forthwith transmitted to the commissioner. Upon receipt of a demand for a survey the commissioner shall immediately issue an order for the same, naming therein three persons to act as surveyors, one of whom shall be an officer or an employee of the bureau of fire prevention or a member of the municipal explosives commission; another shall be an architect or builder of at least ten years&apos; experience nominated by the person demanding the survey, and the third a person to be chosen by the Fire Commissioner from a list to be furnished by the New York Chapter A. I. A., if the premises be in the borough of Manhattan, Bronx, or Richmond, or by the Brooklyn Chapter A. I. A. if the premises be in the borough of Brooklyn or Queens, or by the New York Society of Architects, or by the American Society of Civil Engineers, or provided by the commissioner, with the approval of the mayor, in the event that such chapter or such society shall not furnish such a list. If the person demanding the survey neglects or refuses to appoint such surveyor, the other two surveyors may make such survey; and in case of disagreement of the latter they may appoint a third person to take part in such survey who shall also be an architect or builder of at least ten years&apos; experience. The date and hour when the survey shall be made shall be stated in the order therefor. A copy of such order shall be served upon the person demanding the survey at least twenty-four hours before the hour fixed in the order for the holding of such survey and he shall have the right to be present and be heard at the same in person, or by an agent or attorney; provided that such copy of an order of survey be served as provided generally in respect of service of orders of the department, by section seven hundred and seventy-five of this act. Surveys, Certiorari to Review Reports of. Sec. 777a. The surveyors shall meet at the time and place prescribed in the order of their appointment and shall survey the building, structure, vessel, enclos- ure, place or premises referred to in such order and consider the merits of the order of the department in respect of which the survey has been demanded. After such survey and consideration the surveyors shall prepare and sign a report of their pro- ceedings and determination, which shall be filed in the department and a copy thereof shall be given the person demanding such survey, upon his application therefor. The determination of the surveyors in any such case shall be final and conclusive, subject to review by certiorari by the supreme court, application for which shall be made within four days after the filing of the report of the survey in the department. No order made by the supreme court in a proceeding to review the report of a survey shall be appealable. Expenses of Surveys. Sec. 777b. Each person, other than an officer or employees of the depart- ment designated to act as a surveyor, pursuant to the provisions of this article, shall be paid out of the contingent fund of the department the sum of twenty-five dollars for each survey in which he participates, upon the filing of the report thereof in the department. The city shall be entitled to reimbursement for all expenses incident to a survey under the provisions of this article, provided, in the report of the survey, it shall be held that the order of the commissioner, which was the subject of such survey, was in all respects valid and reasonable. In case the demand for a survey is made by a lessee or occupant the com- missioner may require, as a condition precedent to the ordering of a survey, that such lessee or occupant shall deposit with the department the sum of one hundred dollars to indemnify the city for the expenses of the survey, in the event the surveyors confirm the order of the department, which sum shall be returned to the depositor in the event the surveyors shall report such order is invalid or unrea- sonable. No demand for a survey by a lessee or occupant of a building, structure, enclosure, vessel, place or premises shall have any force or effect or be binding in any way upon the commissioner unless and until such deposit to indemnify the department for the expenses of the survey, if required, shall have been made. &quot; &quot;Index 261 INDEX Area of Buildings. fireproof Areaways.

(Certificate after constructed 29 occupied issuar bui &quot; &quot;284 Legal Relations compliance with the terms of the contract is a question of fact. Three hundred and ninety dollars worth of repairs were done on a 96th Street house between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. The contractor failed to do $13.80 worth of brick work, and the owner refused any payment, claiming non-performance of con- tract, although the contractor had not been wilful in his departure from the agree- ment. It was held that the contract was substantially performed, and that the plaintiff could recover the full amount less $13.80, the cost of fixing the defect. The building does not need to be exactly according to the plans to the last detail. What is required is an honest and bona fide effort by the contractor, which results in substantially the structure called for. But even if substantially performed, if his failure to fully perform is deliberate, he can recover nothing. Or if not delib- erate, he can recover nothing, not even the reasonable value, if the contract is not substantially performed. The ordinary construction contract is entire. That is, the owner agrees to pay for a completed building per plans or nothing,—which the contractor knows. While as said, the architect has the power to control the contractor, he has corresponding duties to him. They may be summed up by saying that he must deal reasonably and fairly with the contractor. He must not interfere with the normal progress of the work. He must have the detail drawings ready for the contractor at each step of the work. He must not withhold the certificate, inter- mediate or final, without cause. The building should be gone over with the scrutiny that the average architect would give, and if there is a substantial com- pliance, grant the certificate with allowance for defects. If the architect is guilty of refusal of the certificate through mere caprice, through fraud, collusion with his client, or through continual neglect, the contractor can consider the certificate unnecessary. To What are some of the duties of the architect to his client, the owner? begin with, regardless of any contract relations, the architect is bound to exercise reasonable and ordinary skill and care in the supervision of the building-care such as the average diligent and prudent architect exercises. He is not required to show the highest degree of care so as to practically guarantee that the completed building conforms to the plans to the last detail. It is a question of fact in each case whether such care has been exhibited by the architect, and is best illustrated by reference to concrete cases. For instance, an architect sued in a certain case* for the last installment of his fee, but it was held up because the architect failed to see that the contractor did not cure a certain defect. The defect was that the front parlor windows (the building was a dwelling) were 2 3-4 inches higher from the floor than the back parlor windows, resulting as was conceded through a fault of the masons. The duty of the architect did not include laying out the work, but only to furnish the plans and specifications, which were correct. The evidence of various architects was heard on the question of the perceptibleness of such a defect, and it was de- Icided that an architect by the exercise of reasonable care would not discover it, that he was not required to go around and measure every detail, after he had directed carefully. If he has contracted that the building from his plans will absolutely not extend beyond a certain cost, he has the duty to keep it there of course, and will be liable for any excess. If he agreed that the structure will not extend beyond an estimated sum, it is his duty to keep the price reasonably near such estimate, or he is guilty of a breach of duty to his client. Again, the amount of variation is a question of fact. The architect&apos;s duties are personal,-the client wants this particular architect and therefore he has the duty and obligation to perform his services himself. He may not delegate them to anyone, at least no duty that requires a use of judgment or discretion. His duties being such, death ends all rights in the contract, and of course his executor or administrator cannot carry the building through, as can well be done by such representative in case of many kinds of agreements. We might diverge a moment to ask what the rights of the architect may be under these circumstances. His right e. g. to supervise the construction of a school building is entire. Therefore, since an indivisible contract there is no right to any compensation until the contract is fully performed. Does such a predicament face an architect who may have spent six months in the superintending of a building? No. Death being unforeseen, and it being impossible to finish the service, the courts allow his representative to collect a quantum meruit, or what his services were reasonably worth. To avoid any uncertainty and to keep his fee at the rate at least, that was agreed upon, the architect should apportion the agreed compen- sation to the steps in the progress of the structure, and thus largely forestall the possibility of having the value of his services left to the mercies of a jury. *Peterson v.

SMALL STRUCTURES.-For small structures and for small piers sustaining light loads, the commissioner of buildings having jurisdiction may, in his dis- cretion, allow a reduction in the thickness and projection for footing or base courses herein specified. All base stones shall be well bedded and laid cross- wise, edge to edge. STEPPED-UP FOOTINGS.-If stepped-up footing of brick are used in place of stone, above the concrete, the offsets, if laid in single courses, shal each not exceed one and one-half inches, or if laid in double courses, then each shall not exceed three inches, offsetting the first course of brickwork, back one-half the thickness of the concrete base, so as to properly distribute the load to be imposed thereon. INVERTED ARCHES.-If, in place of a continuous foundation wall, isolated piers are to be built to support the superstructure, where the nature of the ground and the character of the building make it necessary, in the opinion of the com- missioner of buildings having jurisdiction, inverted arches resting on a proper bed of concrete, both designed to transmit with safety the superimposed loads, shall be turned between the piers. The thrust of the outer piers shall be taken up by suitable wrought iron or steel rods and plates. GRILLAGE.-Grillage beams of wrought iron or steel resting on a proper concrete bed may be used. Such beams must be provided with separators and bolts inclosed and filled solid between with concrete, and of such sizes and so arranged as to transmit with safety the superimposed loads. STONE WALLS AND HEADERS.-All stone walls twenty-four inches or less in thickness shall have at least one header extending through the wall in every three feet in height from the bottom of the wall, and in every three feet in length, and if over twenty-four inches in thickness, shall have one header for every six superficial feet on both sides of the wall, laid on top of each other to bond together, and running into the wall at least two feet.

Where mechanical force is required to discharge the contents into the plumbing and drainage system a proper automatic cut off or check valve must be provided on the connection between house-drain and apparatus used for raising the contents of sump-pit. 59. The contents of settling chamber or dust receptacles for vacuum cleaners may be discharged into a plumbing and drainage system, the same as sub-soil drain sump-pits. 60. Every building shall be kept provided with proper metallic gutters and rain leaders for conducting water from all roofs in such manner as shall protect the walls and foundations from injury. In no case shall the water from any rain leader be allowed to flow upon the sidewalk or adjoining property, but the same shall be conducted by proper pipes to the sewer. If there be no sewer in the street upon which the building fronts, then the water from said leaders may be conducted by proper pipes laid below the surface of sidewalk to the street gutter, or may be conducted by extra heavy cast iron pipe to a leeching cesspool located at least 20 feet from any building. No plumbing fixtures shall discharge into a leeching cesspool. 61. Inside leaders must be made of cast-iron, wrought iron or steel, with roof connections made gas and water tight by means of a heavy lead or copper- drawn tubing wiped to a brass ferrule or nipple calked or screwed into the pipe. 62. Outside leaders may be made of sheet metal, but they must connect with the house drain by means of a cast-iron pipe extending vertically five feet above the grade level. 63. Leaders must be trapped with cast-iron running traps so placed as to prevent freezing. 64. Rain-water leaders must not be used as soil, waste or vent pipes nor shall any such pipe be used as a leader. 65. The House Sewer, House Drain, House Trap and Fresh Air Inlet. Old house sewers can be used in connection with the new buildings or new plumbing only when they are found, on examination by the plumbing inspector, to conform in all respects to the requirements governing new sewers. 66. When a proper foundation consisting of a natural bed of earth, rock, etc., can be obtained, the house sewer can be of earthenware pipe. 67. Where the ground is made or filled in, or where the pipes are less than three feet deep, or in any case where there is danger of settlement by frost or from any cause, and when cesspools are used, the house sewer must be of extra heavy cast-iron pipe, with lead-caulked joints. 68. No earthenware house-drain when found in a leaky or defective condi- tion, shall be repaired or replaced except with heavy cast-iron pipe. 69. The house drain and its branches must be of extra heavy cast-iron when underground, and of extra heavy cast-iron or galvanized wrought iron or steel when above ground. 70. The house drain must properly connect with the house sewer at a point two feet outside of the outer front vault or area wall of the building. An arched or other proper opening must be provided for the drain in the wall to prevent damage by settlement. 71. The house drain if above the cellar floor must be supported at intervals of ten feet by eight-inch brick piers or suspended from the floor beams, or be otherwise properly supported by proper hangers placed not more than 10 feet apart. 72. No steam exhaust, boiler blow off or drip pipe shall be connected with the house drain. Such pipes must first discharge into a proper condensing tank, and from this a proper outlet to the house sewer outside of the building must be provided. In low pressure steam systems the condensing tank may be omitted, but the waste connections must be otherwise as above required. 73. The house-drain and house-sewer must be run as direct as possible, with a fall of at least one-quarter inch per foot, all changes in direction made with proper fittings, and all connections made with Y branches and one-eighth and one-sixteenth bends. 74. The house sewer and house drain must be at least 4 inches in diameter when receiving the discharge of a water-closet. Where rain leaders are connected to the plumbing system, the sizes of house sewer, house drain and leader connec- tions shall be computed according to the square feet of area drained into them. &quot; &quot;188 Tenement House Law Old Tenements Conditions of occupancy.

Every pier built of brick, containing less than nine superficial feet at the base, suporting any beam, girder, arch or column on which a wall rests, or lintel spanning an opening over ten feet and supporting a wall, shall at intervals of not over thirty inches apart in height have built into it a bond stone not less than four inches thick, or a cast-iron plate of sufficient strength, and the full size of the piers. CAP-STONES. For piers fronting on a street the bond stones may conform with the kind of stone used for the trimmings of the front. Cap stones of cut granite or blue stone, proportioned to the weight to be carried, but not less than five inches in thickness,, by the full size of the pier, or cast-iron plates of equal strength by the full size of the pier, shall be set under all columns or girders, except where a four-inch bond stone is placed immediately below said cap stone, in which case the cap stone may be reduced in horizontal dimensions at the dis- cretion of the commissioner of buildings having jurisdiction. ISOLATED PIERS.-Isolated brick piers shall not exceed in height ten times their least dimensions. Stone posts for the support of posts or columns above shall not be used in the interior of any building. COURSED STONE.-Where walls or piers are built of coursed stones, with dressed level beds and vertical joints, the department of buildings shall have the right to allow such walls or piers to be built of a less thickness than specified for brickwork, but in no case shall said walls or piers be less than three-quarters of the thickness provided for brickwork. HEADER COURSES.—In all brick walls every sixth course shall be a heading course, except where walls are faced with brick in running bond, in which latter case, every sixth course shall be bonded into the backing by cutting the course of the face brick and putting in diagonal headers behind the same, or by splitting the face brick in half and backing the same with a continuous row of headers. FACE BRICK.-Where face brick is used of a different thickness from the brick used for backing, the courses of the exterior and interior brick work shall be brought to a level bed at intervals of not more than ten courses in height of the face brick, and the face brick shall be properly tied to the backing by a heading course of the face brick. &quot; &apos;124 Plumbing and Drainage the test. The plumber must securely close all openings, as directed by the In- spector of Plumbing. The use of wooden plugs for this purpose is prohibited. 172. The water test will be applied by closing the lower end of the main house-drain and filling the pipes to the highest opening above the roof with water. The water test shall include at one time the house drain and branches, all vertical and horizontal soil, waste and vent and leader lines and all branches therefrom to a point above the surface of the finished floor and beyond the finished face of walls and partitions. If the drain or any part of the system is to be tested separately there must be a head of water at least six (6) feet above all parts of the work so tested, and special provision must be made for including all joints and connections in at least one test. 173.

COLUMNS.—Where columns are used to support iron or steel girders carry- ing inclosure walls, the said columns shall be of cast iron, wrought iron, or rolled steel, and on their exposed outer and inner surfaces be constructed to resist fire by having a casing of brickwork not less than eight inches in thickness on the outer surfaces, nor less than four inches in thickness on the inner surfaces, and all bonded into the brickwork of the inclosure walls. GIRDERS.—The exposed sides of the iron or steel girders shall be similarly covered in with brickwork not less than four inches in thickness on the outer surfaces and tied and bonded, but the extreme outer edge of the flanges of beams or plates or angles connected to the beams, may project to within two inches of the outside surface of the brick casing. The inside surfaces of girders may be simi- larly covered with brickwork, or if projecting inside of the wall they shall be protected by terra-cotta, concrete or other fireproof material. Girders for the support of the inclosure walls shall be placed at the floor line of each story. Sec. 111. (Steel and Wrought Iron Columns.) THICKNESS. No part of a steel or wrought iron column shall be less than one-quarter of an inch thick.

CONNECTIONS. The ends of all columns shall be faced to a plane surface at right angles to the axis of the columns and the connection between them shall be made with splice plates. The joint may be affected by rivets of sufficient size and number to transmit the entire stress, and then the splice plates shall be equal in sectional area to the area of column spliced. When the section of the columns to be spaced so that the ratio of length by the least radius of gyration of the plates and angles may be used, designed to properly distribute the stress. PROPORTIONAL THICKNESS.-No material, whether in the body of the column or used as lattice-bar or stay-plate, shall be used in any wrought iron or steel column of less thickness than one-thirty-second of its unsupported width measured between centres of rivets transversely, or one-sixteenth the distance between centres or rivets in the direction of the stress. STAY-PLATES.-Stay-plates are to have not less than four rivets, and are to be spaced so that the ratio of length by the least radius of gyration of the parts connected does not exceed forty; the distance between nearest rivets of two stay-plates shall in this case be considered as length. Steel and wrought iron columns shall be made in one, two or three-story lengths, and the materials shall be rolled in one length wherever practicable to avoid intermediate splices. FILLING PLATES.--Where any part of the section of a column projects beyond that of the column below, the difference shall be made up by filling plates secured to column by the proper number of rivets. SHOES.-Shoes of iron or steel, as described for cast-iron columns, or built shoes of plates and shapes may be used, complying with same requirements. Sec. 112. (Cast-Iron Columns.) THICKNESS.-Cast-iron columns shall not have less diameter than five inches or less thickness than three-quarters of an inch. Nor shall they have an unsupported length of more than twenty times their least lateral dimensions or diameters, except as modified by section 138 of this code, and except the same may form part of an elevator inclosure or staircase, and also except in such cases as the commissioner of buildings having jurisdiction may specially allow a greater unsupported length. All cast-iron columns shall be of good workmanship and material. The top and bottom flanges, seats and lugs shall be of ample strength reinforced by fillets and brackets; they shall not be less than one inch in thickness when finished.

All improvements specifically required by this act upon dwellings erected prior to the date of its passage shall be made within one year from said date, or at such earlier period as may be fixed by the health officer. Sec. 11. Scope of act. visions of this act shall All the pro- apply to all &apos; &quot;102 Building Code where same exists, at the centre of front or side of building on which main entrance to upper floors is located. Where the walls of a building do not adjoin the street or building line, then the average level of the ground on which the building stands may be taken in place of the curb line. HEIGHT. The measurement for height shall be the highest point of roof- beams in case of flat-roof buildings, and to the average height of gable or roof in case of pitched roofs. Towers, turrets and minarets of wood may be erected to a height not to exceed fifteen feet greater than the foregoing limited height, except that the spires of churches may be erected of wood to a height not ex- ceeding ninety feet from the ground. FOOTINGS.-All footings or bottom stones shall be at least six inches wider on each side than the bottom width of foundation walls above, except where the outside of the foundation wall sets on the property line, in which case six inches wider on the inside shall be sufficient. The thickness of footings shall be not less than eight inches, if of stone, and not less than twelve inches if of Concrete. FOUNDATION WALLS.-Foundations for frame structures shall be laid not less than four feet below the finished surface of the earth, or upon the surface where there is rock bottom, or upon piles or ranging timbers where found neces- sary. The foundation walls of frame structures exceeding fifteen feet in height, if of stone, shall be not less than eighteen inches thick, and if of brick, not less than twelve inches to the grade and eight inches thick to the under side of the sill. If the foundation and first-story walls are constructed of brick, the founda- tion walls shall be not less than twelve inches thick to the first tier of beams and eight inches thick from first tier to second tier of beams; or if these walls are constructed of stone they shall be not less than twenty inches for the first- story wall; and if the walls are faced with stone ashlar the total thickness shall .be four inches greater than in this section specified. In the foundation walls there may be recesses not more than eight feet long for stairs, with brick walls not less than eight inches thick. CHIMNEYS.-All chimneys in frame buildings shall be built of brick or stone or other fireproof material. If of brick the flues shall have walls at least eight inches thick, except where flues are lined with burnt-clay pipe, in which case the walls around flues may be four inches thick. All flue linings shall extend at least one foot above the roof boards. Where chimneys are built of stone the walls of the flues shall be not less than eight inches on all sides, and shall be lined with burnt-clay pipe. All chimneys shall be topped out at least four feet above the highest point of contact with the roof, and be properly capped. Chim- neys in party walls or serving two rooms on the same floor may be built in the walls or partitions; elsewhere, they shall be built inside of the frame except in the case of ornamental or exposed chimneys. WALLS. In no case shall a frame building be erected within three feet of the side or rear line of a lot, unless the space between the studs on any such side be filled in solidly with not less than two and one-half inches of brickwork or other fireproof material. When two or more such buildings are built con- tinuous the party of division studding shall be not less than four inches thick and filled in solidly with brickwork or other fireproof material extending to the under side of roof boards. When the division walls are of brick they shall be not less than eight inches thick above the foundation wall and extending to under side of roof boards, and the ends of the floor beams shall be so separated that four inches of brick will be between the beams where they rest on said walls. FRAME CONSTRUCTION. The sills of all frame dwellings, except where the first floor is used for store or business purposes, shall be not less than two feet above the ground to the under side of same. All frame or wood buildings exceeding a height of fifteen feet shall be built with sills, posts, girts, plates and rafters, all of suitable size and properly framed and braced with suitable studs or planks, set at proper distance apart; but this shall not prohibit the use of balloon-framing. The floor beams and rafters shall be not less than two inches in thickness. The covering of roof may be of shingle. The walls of light, vent and dumbwaiter shafts, whether exterior or interior, in frame buildings may be constructed of frame. Posts of locust or other hard wood and wood girders may be used instead of brick fore-and-aft partitions in cellars of frame buildings, and it shall not be necessary to use metal or wire lath for the ceilings of cellars or lowest floors of any frame building. The cellar stairs in frame buildings may be placed directly under main stairs, and no brick wall shall be necessary to inclose the same; nor shall areas be required to be built across the front of frame buildings, except where the cellar or basement is used for living purposes. &quot; &quot;Labor Law 205 of exit in buildings more than five stories in height and the landings, platforms and passageways connected therewith shall be enclosed on all sides by partitions of fire-resisting material extending continuously from the basement. Where the stairway extends to the top floor of the building such partitions shall extend to three feet above the roof. All openings in such partitions shall be provided with self-closing doors constructed of fire-resisting material except where such open- ings are in the exterior wall of the building. All such partitions and the doors provided for the openings therein shall be constructed in such manner as the industrial board may prescribe by its rules and regulations. The industrial board shall have power to adopt rules and regulations requiring the enclosure of stairways serving as required exists in buildings of five stories or less in height or in particular classes of such buildings wherever the board finds that because of the conditions existing in such buildings such requirement is necessary to secure the safety of the lives of the occupants thereof in case of fire. Whenever in the case of any existing buildings not over six stories in height, the industrial board shall find that the requirements of this and the last preceding subdivision relating to stairway enclosures can be dispensed with or modified without endan- gering the safety of persons employed in such buildings, the industrial board shall have power to adopt such rules and regulations as may, in its opinion, meet the conditions existing in such buildings, which rules and regulations may make said requirements inapplicable or modify the same in such manner as it may find to be adapted to securing the safety of persons employed therein. The industrial board shall have power to adopt rules and regulations, permitting under condi- tions therein prescribed as a substitute for the stairway enclosures herein re- quired the use of partitions heretofore constructed in such manner and of such fire resisting material as have heretofore been approved by the local authorities exercising supervision over the construction and alteration of buildings. In such cases, however, every opening in the enclosing partitions shall be provided with fire doors. 3. Doors. Where five or more persons are employed on any floor of a factory building every door on such floor leading to or opening on any means of exit shall open outwardly or be double swinging doors or slide freely. All exit doors in the first story, including the doors of the vestibule, shall open outwardly. 4. Fire-escapes. All outside fire-escapes shall be constructed of wrought iron or steel and shall be so designed, constructed and erected as to safely sustain on all platforms, balconies and stairways a live load of not less than ninety pounds per square foot with a factor of safety of four. Wherever practicable, a con- tinuous run or straight run stairway shall be used. On every floor above the first there shall be balconies or landings embracing one or more easily accessible and unobstructed openings at each floor level, connected with each other and with the ground by means of a stairway constructed as hereinafter provided and well fas- tened and secured. All openings leading to outside fire escapes shall have an un- obstructed width of at least two feet and an unobstructed height of at least six feet. Such openings shall extend to the floor level or within six inches thereof, and shall be not more than seven inches above the floor of the fire-escape balcony, shall have metal frames, or frames covered with metal, and be provided with doors constructed of fireproof material with wired glass where glass is used, except in cases where fire-escapes are hereafter erected on buildings constructed prior to October first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, of five stories or under in height, in which cases the provisions of subdivision five as to the use of steps to connect with the fire-escapes and as to the construction of openings leading to fire- escapes shall apply. All windows opening upon the course of the fire-escape shall be fireproof windows. The balconies shall have an unobstructed width of at least four feet throughout their length and shall have a landing not less than twenty- four inches square at the head of every stairway. There shall be a passageway between the stairway opening and the side of the building at least eighteen inches wide throughout, except where the stairways reach, and leave the balconies at the ends, or where double run stairways are used. The stairway opening of the bal- conies shall be of a size sufficient to provide clear headway and shall be guarded on the long side by an iron railing not less than three feet in height. Each balcony shall be surrounded by an iron railing not less than three feet in height thor- oughly and properly braced. The balconies shall be connected by stairways not less than twenty-two inches wide placed at an incline of not more than forty- five degrees, with steps of not less than eight-inch tread and not over eight-inch rise and provided with a hand-rail not less than three feet in height. The treads of such stairways shall be so constructed as to sustain a live load of four hundred pounds per step with a factor of safety of four. There shall be a similar stairway from the top floor balcony to the roof, except where the fire-escape is erected on the front of the building. A similar stairway shall also be provided from the &quot; &quot;70 Building Code FLUES TO BE CLEANED.-All flues in every building shall be properly cleaned and all rubbish removed, and the flues left smooth on the inside upon the completion of the building. Sec. 66. (Chimney Supports.) No chimney shall be started or built upon any floor or beam of wood. CORBELING.-In no case shall a chimney be corbeled out more than eight inches from the wall, and in all such cases the corbeling shall consist of at least five courses of brick, but no corbeling more than four inches shall be allowed in eight-inch brick walls. SUPPORTS.-When chimneys are supported by piers, the piers shall start from the foundation on the same line with the chimney breast, and shall be not less than twelve inches on the face properly bonded into the walls. When a chimney is to be cut off below, in whole or in part, it shall be wholly supported by stone, brick, iron or steel. UNSAFE. All chimneys which shall be dangerous in any manner whatever, shall be repaired and made safe, or taken down. Sec. 67. (Chimneys of Cupolas.) CHIMNEYS OF FOUNDRIES.-Iron cupola chimneys of foundaries shall ex- tend at least ten feet above the highest point of any roof within a radius of fifty feet of such cupola, and be covered on top with a heavy wire netting. No wood- work shall be placed within two feet of the cupola. Sec. 68. (Hot Air Flues, Pipes and Vent Ducts.) HOT AIR FLUES AND SMOKE PIPES.-All stone or brick hot air flues and shafts shall be lined with tin, galvanized iron or burnt-clay pipes. No wood casing, furring or lath shall be placed against or cover any smoke flue or metal pipe used to convey hot air or steam. No smoke pipe shall pass through any wood floor. No stove pipe shall be placed nearer than nine inches to any lath and plaster or board partition, ceiling or any woodwork. Smoke pipes of laundry stoves, large cooking ranges and of furnaces shall be not less than fifteen inches from any woodwork, unless they are properly guarded by metal shields; if so guarded, stovepipes shall be not less than six inches distant, smoke pipes of laundry stoves, large cooking ranges and of furnaces shall be not less than nine inches distant from any woodwork. Where smoke pipes pass through a lath and plaster partition they shall be guarded by galvanized iron ventilated thimbles at least twelve inches larger in diameter than the pipes, or by galvanized iron thimbles built in at least eight inches of brickwork. SMOKE PIPES THROUGH ROOF.-No smoke pipe shall pass through the roof of any building unless a special permit be first obtained from the building department for the same. If a permit is so granted, then the roof through which the smoke pipe passes shall be protected in the following manner: A galvanized iron ventilated thimble of the following dimensions shall be placed; in case of a stovepipe, the diameter of the outside guard shall be not less than twelve inches and the diameter of the inner one, eight inches, and for all furnaces, or where similar large hot fires are used, the diameter of the outside guard shall be not less than eighteen inches and the diameter of the inner one, twelve inches. The smoke pipe thimbles shall extend from the under side of the ceiling or roof beams to at least nine inches above the roof, and they shall have openings for ventilation at the lower end where the smoke pipes enter, also at the top of the guards above the roof. Where a smoke pipe of a boiler passes through a roof, the same shall be guarded by a ventilated thimble, same as before specified, thirty- six inches larger than the diameter of the smoke pipe of the boiler. HOT AIR PIPES IN WALLS AND PARTITIONS.-Tin or other metal pipes in brick or stone walls, used or intended to be used to convey heated air, shall be covered with brick or stone at least four inches in thickness. Woodwork near hot-air pipes shall be guarded in the following manner: A hot-air pipe shall be placed inside another pipe, one inch larger in diameter, or a metal shield shall be placed not less than one-half inch from the hot-air pipe; the outside pipe or the metal shield shall remain one and a half inches away from the wood- work, and the latter must be tin lined, or in lieu of the above protection, four inches of brickwork may be placed between the hot-air pipe and the woodwork. This shall not prevent the placing of metal lath and plaster directly on the face of hot-air pipes or the placing of woodwork on such metal lath or plaster, pro. vided the distance is not less than seven-eights of an inch. No vertical hot-air pipe shall be placed in a stud partition, or in a wood inclosure, unless it be at least eight feet distant in a horizontal direction from the furnace.

Classification of risks and ad- justment of premiums. Employments coming under the provisions of this chapter shall be divided for the pur- poses of the state fund, into the groups set forth in section two of this chapter. Separate accounts shall be kept of the amounts collected and expended in re- spect to each such group for conveni- ence in determining equitable rates; but for the purpose of paying compensation the state fund shall be deemed one and indivisable. The commission shall have power to rearrange any of the groups set forth in section two by withdrawing any employment embraced in it and transferring it wholly or in part to any other group, and from such employ- ments to set up new groups at its dis- cretion. The commission shall deter- mine the hazards of the different classes composing each group and fix the rates of premiums therefor based upon the total payroll and number of employees in each of such classes of employment at the lowest possible rate consistent with the maintenance of a solvent state insurance fund and the creation of a reasonable surplus and reserve; and for such purpose may adopt a system of schedule rating in such a manner as to take account of the peculiar hazard of each individual risk. Sec. 96. Associations for accident pre- vention. The employers in any of the groups described in section two or es- tablished by the commission may with the approval of the commission form themselves into an association for ac- cident prevention, and may make rules for that purpose. If the commission is of the opinion that an association SO formed sufficiently represents the em- ployers in such group, it may approve such rules, and when so approved and approved by the industrial board of the labor department they shall be binding on all employers in such group. If such an approved association appoint an inspector or expert for the purpose of accident prevention, the commission may at its discretion provide in whole or in part for the payment of the re- muneration and expenses of such in- spection or expert, such payment to be charged in the accounting to such group. Every such approved association may make recommendations to the commis- sion concerning the fixing of premiums for classes of hazards, and for individual risks within such group. Ser. 97. Requirements in classifying employment and fixing and adjusting premium rates. The following require- ments shall be observed in classifying employments and fixing and adjusting premium rates: 1. The commission shall keep an ac- curate account of the money paid in premiums by each of the several classes of employments or industries, and the disbursements on account of injuries and deaths of employees thereof, includ- ing the setting up of reserves adequate to meet anticipated losses and to carry the claims to maturity, and also, an ac- count of the money received from each individual employer and the amount dis- bursed from the state insurance fund on account of injuries and death of the employees of such employer, including the reserves so set up; 2. On January first, nineteen hundred and fifteen, and every fifth year there- after, and at such other times as the commission, in its discretion, may de- termine, a readjustment of the rate shall be made for each of the several groups of employment or industries and of each hazard class therein, which, in the judg- ment of the commission, shall have de- veloped an average loss ratio, in accord- ance with the experience of the com- mission in the administration of the law as shown by the accounts kept as pro- vided herein; 3. If any such accounting show an aggregate balance (deemed by the com- mission to be safely and properly *de- visible) remaining to the credit of any class of employment or industry, after the amount required shall have been credited to the surplus and reserve funds and after the payment of all awards for injury or death lawfully chargeable against the same, the commission may in its discretion credit to each individual member of such group, who shall have been a subscriber to the state insurance fund for a period of six months or more prior to the time of such readjustment, and whose premium or premiums exceed the amount of the disbursements from the fund on account of injuries or death of his employees during such period, on the installment or installments of pre- miums next due from him such propor- tion of such balance as the amount of his prior paid premiums sustains to the whole amount of such premiums paid by the group to which he belongs since the last readjustment of rates; 4. If the amount of premiums col- lected from any employer at the begin- ning of any period of six months is as- certained and calculated by using the estimated expediture of wages for the period of time covered by such premium payment as a basis, an adjustment of the amount of such premium shall be made at the end of such six months, and the actual amount of such premium shall be determined in accordance with the amount of the actual expenditure of wages for such period; and, if such So in original. &quot; &apos; MISSISSIPPI WIRE W FIRE GLASS-CO RETARDANT No 32 The Approved &quot;Wire Glass&quot; Upon which the Standard Is Based GET THE BEST BY SPECIFYING &quot;WIRE GLASS&quot; Manufactured by the MISSISSIPPI WIRE GLASS CO.

Contruction of the Building: The hazard here is affected by the materials and workmanship entering into the con- struction, their thickness and strength. An approved Building Code is gener- ally utilized by the Underwriters in judg- ing the adequacy of wall thicknesses and the strength of materials. Structural steel members are required to be thoroughly covered with fire re- sistive material; as terra cotta, brick, concrete or other approved material of adequate thickness. The material and workmanship should also be of such that, in case of fire, a powerful hose stream will not destroy the protection and expose the steel to the flame. The National Fire Protection Associa- tion at its annual convention in May, 1913, adopted regulations for a &amp;quot;Stand- ard Fire Resistive Building of the High- est Type.&amp;quot; This standard is for build- ing that would resist a temperature of 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit for four hours without material injury to its structural parts. Although impractical to erect all buildings as prescribed by this docu- ment, it is, nevertheless, an ideal that can be approached in any building at least in part. A suggested Building Ordinance especially intended for small towns and villages was also adopted in 1913 and treats especially of protection for the &amp;quot;non-fireproof&amp;quot; buildings. III. Plan of the Building: The haz- ard here includes questions of height, area, the location of fire stops, facilities for the escape of the occupants and facilities for access for firemen. The height of a building seriously affects its insurance, because, beyond a certain height the Fire Departments can not be depended upon, for the present at least, for effective work. It is evident also that the larger the area the greater the danger of fire get- ting beyond control. When the area of any floor exceeds 5,000 square feet the insurance cost is generally higher. Fire stops are provided to decrease the area in large buildings. Fire stops are either brick or concrete &amp;quot;fire&amp;quot; walls, no less than 12 inches thick, to prevent the fire spreading in a horizontal direction. To prevent the fire spreading in a vertical direction through openings be- tween stories, such as staircases, shafts, elevators, vents, ducts, etc., such open- ings are shut off by fire stops. These should be of at least the same fire re- sistive quality as the floor construction dividing the stories. For the purpose of allowing commu- nication between the various areas in a horizontal direction and between the floors in a vertical direction, doors are provided which should be standard. Of other elements included in plan and construction are the electric wiring and fittings, protection against light- ning, whether the building be fire re- sistive or mill construction and win- dows of wired glass with metal frames. Special standards have also been adopt- ed for the construction of railway car nouses and for gravity tanks. IV. Fire Extinguishing Equipment: The hazard here is affected by the char- acter of the protective apparatus, either stationary or movable, such as sprinklers, standpipes, pumps, valves, water supply, hand extinguishers, watch- man&apos;s clocks, fire drills, fire alarms, hose, etc., all designed to extinguish fire in its incipient stage. V. The Nature of the Occupancy: The consideration of this hazard includes these points: Whether the merchandise and temporary fixtures are combustible or not, whether explosive or highly inflammable materials are stored, wheth- er there are few or many employes, the nature of the work being done, whether or not the place is kept clean, whether or not the fire extinguisher apparatus is kept in order and whether or not the special mechanism or apparatus being used is standard and properly taken care of. Gas machines and engines, incuba- tors and brooders, kerosene oil pressure systems, oxy-acetylene heating and weld- ing apparatus, waste cans and ash cans, films, oil storage and gasolene stoves for cooking are all, if improperly install- ed, hazards of this nature. The danger of fire due to carelessness or viciousness on the part of the owner, is commonly known among Underwriters as the moral hazard. It is quite distinct from the physical hazard, but a careful investigation of the moral hazard is es- sential in insurance. VI. Public Fire Protection: This part of the hazard which depends on the ef- ficiency of Municipal Departments notably the Fire, Water and Building Departments, has an important bearing on the fire loss and consequently the cost of insurance. Architects, builders and property owners can exert an important influence in fire prevention by encourag- ing the enactment of adequate laws on these subjects and insisting on an effi- cient administration of such laws. The principal publications issued by the National Board of Fire Under- writers are listed herewith. Many of the standards described in these pub- lications will be of invaluable assistance to architects, builders and others terested in building construction and maintenance. in- Any of these pamphlets may be pro- cured from The New York Board of Fire Underwriters; they may be secured through insurance brokers, and they may be had on application to the Na- &quot; &quot;Board of Examiners 37 BOARD OF EXAMINERS OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK MUNICIPAL BUILDING, 20th FLOOR Room 2028 Telephone, 3280 Worth BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN GEORGE A.

The value used is 39.37 inches, authorized by the United States govern- ment. The meter is defined as one-ten-millionth the distance from the pole to the equator, measured on a meridian passing near Paris. There are three principal units-the meter, the liter and the gram, the units of length, capacity and weight, respectively. Multiples of these units are obtained by prefixing to the names of the principal units the Greek words Deca (10), Hecto (100), and Kilo (1,000); the submultiples or divisions, are obtained by prefixing the Latin words deci (1/10), centi (1/100), and milli (1/1000). These prefixes form the key to the system. In the following tables the abbreviations of the principal units of these submultiples begin with a small letter, while those of the multiples begin with a capital letter. Measures of Length.

Said notice may be filed at the time of the commencement of the action or proceeding, or at any time afterwards before final judgment or order, or at any time after the ser- vice of any notice or order issued by said health officer. Such notice shall have the same force and effect as the notice of pendency of action provided for in the code of civil procedure. Each county clerk with whom such notice is filed shall record it, and shall index it to the name of each person specified in a direction subscribed by the corpora- tion counsel. Any such notice may be vacated upon the order of a judge or justice of the court in which such action or proceeding was instituted or is pend- ing, or upon the consent in writing of the corporation counsel. The clerk of the county where such notice is filed is hereby directed to mark such notice and any record or docket thereof as canceled of record, upon the presentation and filing of such consent or of a certified copy of such order. Sec. 148. Registry of owner&apos;s name. Every owner of a dwelling and every lessee of the whole house, or other per- son having control of a dwelling, shall file in the health department a notice containing his name and address, and also a description of the property, by street number or otherwise, as the case may be, in such manner as will enable the said department easily to find the same; and also the number of apart- ments in each house, the number of rooms in each apartment, and the num- ber of families occupying the apart- ments. Sec. 149. Registry of agent&apos;s name. Every owner, agent or lessee of a dwell- ing may file in the health department a notice containing the name and address of an agent of such house, for the pur- pose of receiving service of process, and also a description of the property by street number or otherwise, as the case may be, in such manner as will enable the health department easily to find the same. The name of the owner or lessee may be filed as agent for this purpose. Sec. 150. Service of notices and or- ders. Every notice or order in relation to a dwelling shall be served five days before the time for doing the thing in relation to which it shall have been is- sued. The posting of a copy of such notice or order in a conspicuous place in the dwelling, together with the mail- ing of a copy thereof, on the same day that it is posted, to each person, if any, whose name has been filed with the health department, in accordance with the provisions of sections one hundred and forty-eight and one hundred and forty-nine of this act, at his address as &quot; &quot;lxix General.

Rules and Regulations. Adopted by the Superintendents of Buildings for the City of New York, Feb. 26, 1912, and published in accordance with the provisions of Section 141 of the Building Code, Section 409 of the Greater New York Charter. Once in each year, every employing or master plumber carrying on his trade, business or calling in THE CITY OF NEW YORK shall register his name and address at the office of The Bureau of Buildings in the Borough in which his place of business is located, under such rules and regulations as said Bureau shall pre- scribe, in accordance with Section 141 of the Building Code of THE CITY OF NEW YORK. A plumber proposing to do work in a borough other than that in which he is registered shall present his certificate at the office of the Bureau of Buildings in that borough before commencing work, so that the fact of his having been prop- erly registered may be recorded. Filing of Drawings, Descriptions, Etc. 1. Drawings and triplicate descriptions, on forms furnished by the Bureau of Buildings for all Plumbing and Drainage shall be properly filled in, and filed by the owner or architest in the said Bureau. The plans must be drawn to scale in ink, on cloth, or they must be cloth prints of such scale drawings, and shall consist of such floor plans and sections as may be necessary to show clearly all plumbing work to be done, and must show partitions and methods of ventilating water-closet apartments. 2. The said plumbing and drainage shall not be commenced or proceeded with until said drawings and descriptions shall have been so filed and approved by the Superintendent of Buildings. 3. No modification of the approved drawings and descriptions will be per- mitted unless either amended drawings and triplicate descriptions, or an amend- ment to the original drawings and descriptions, covering the proposed change or changes, are so filed and approved by the Superintendent of Buildings. 4. The drainage and plumbing of all buildings, both public and private, shall be executed in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Bureau of Build- ings. 5. Repairs or alterations of plumbing or drainage may be made without filing drawings and descriptions in the Bureau of Buildings, but such repairs or altera- tions shall not be construed to include cases where new vertical lines or horizontal branches of soil, waste, vent or leader pipes are proposed to be used. 6. Notice of such repairs or alterations shall be given to the said Bureau before the same are commenced in such cases as shall be prescribed by the rules and regulations of the said Bureau, and the work shall be done in accordance with the said rules and regulations. 7. Where repairs or alterations ordered by the Board of Health, or Tenement House Department for sanitary reasons, include cases where new vertical and horizontal lines of soil, waste, vent or leader pipes are proposed to be used or old ones replaced, drawings and descriptions must be filed with and approved by the Supt. of Buildings before same shall be commenced or proceeded with. 8. Repairs and alterations may comply in all respects with the weight, quality, arrangement and venting of the rest of the work in the building. Except when an existing soil, waste or vent line has been damaged by fire or other causes to the extent of 50% or more, of its entire length, same must be replaced by new lines installed in accordance with the rules and regulations governing new lines. 9. No plumbing and drainage or any part thereof shall be commenced until the plumber who is to do the work shall sign the specifications and make affidavit that he is duly authorized to proceed with the work. Affidavit must give the name and address of owner and plumber, etc. No registered plumber shall sign the specifications and act as the agent for a plumber who has not obtained a certificate of competency from the Examining Board of Plumbers as an Employing or Master Plumber. A violation of this rule will be deemed a sufficient reason by the Super- intendent of Buildings for the cancellation of a Certificate of Registration, in accordance with Chapter 803, Laws of 1896. 10. One set of specifications will be received for not more than ten houses, and then only when on adjoining lots and houses are exactly alike. 11. Written notices must be given to the Superintendent of Buildings by the plumber when any work is begun, and at such times as the work is ready fo inspection. &quot; &quot;V PASTEUR WATER FILTERS Scientifically Standard and the Only Absolutely 100% Germ Proof Filters No Laboratory, Hospital, Residence, Hotel or Office is completely equipped without a Pasteur Filtering Apparatus.

Greenwich Street NEW YORK &quot; &quot;Electrical Definitions 275 • ELECTRICAL DEFINITIONS Practical Units and Formulae Volt is the unit of electro-motive force which in formulae is symbolized by E. Electro-Motive Force is the force that moves electricity, and is written E. M. F. Potential and E. M. F. are different ways of regarding the same agency and are equal in value. Both are measured in volts, and are equal at the same point. Potential relates to inductive circuit, and E. M. F. to conductive cir- cuit. One volt will force one ampère of current through one ohm of resistance. Its value is purely abritrary, but fixed. Ohm is the unit of resistance which in formulae is symbolized by R. (What is its value?) One ohm is that resistance through which one ampère of current will flow at a pressure of one volt of E. M. F. Ampère is the unit of current per second, which in formulae is symbolized by C. Its value is that quantity of elec- tricity which flows per second through one ohm of resistance, when impelled by one volt of E. M. F. One ampère of current flowing through a bath will deposit 0.017253 grain of silver, or 0.005084 grain of copper per second. The relations which exist between E. M. F., resistance, and current are known as Ohm&apos;s Law. Its simplest ex- pressions are as follows: In an electrical circuit the Current in ampères may be found by dividing the E. M. F. in volts by the resistance in ohms. The E. M. F. in volts may be found by multiplying the current in ampères by the resistance in ohms. The Resistance in ohms may be found by dividing the E. M. F. in volts by the current in ampères. In a given resistance an increase of E. M. F. must be accompanied by a proportional increase of current; or an increase of current must be accompa- nied by a proportional increase of E. M. F.; but an increase of resistance will be accompanied by a proportional in- crease of E. M. F., or a proportional de- crease of current; and a decrease of re- sistance will be accompanied by a pro- portional decrease of E. M. F., or a proportional increase of current. According to these relations, it is seen that C and R are each the reciprocal of the other multiplied by E; that is to say, that C and R limit and define each other where E is a fixed quantity. Power is the rate of doing work, and is proportional to the E. M. F. multi- plied by the current. In a given resistance, Energy, such as work or heat, varies as the square of the current or of the electro-motive force. The Watt is the unit of electrical power. One volt multiplied by one ampère equals one watt. One Electrical Horse Power equals 746 watts. That is to say, a current of 1 ampère and 746 volts would be one electrical horse power. And one horse power expended wholly in producing electric energy would generate 1 am- père in 746 ohms resistance, or 746 ampères in 1 ohm resistance. For copper wire the square of diam- eter, with the following constants, will give the following properties, d being equal in diameter: Feet per pound, divide 330560 by d&apos;. Yards per pound, divide 110187 by d&apos;. Grains per foot, multiply 0.0211761 by d². Pounds per 1,000 feet, multiply 0.0030252 by d². Pounds per mile, multiply 0.015973 by d². Pounds per nautical mile, multiply 0.018414 by d². The same constants used in the op- posite manner will give the area, from which the diameter may be found by dividing it by .7854 and extracting the square root. The following figures furnish useful data as to copper wire; they are the resistances of a wire 1/1000 of an inch diameter, and of the length named, at 60° Fahrenheit. Divided by the sec- tional area they will give: 10.3365 will give ohms per foot. 31.0095 will give ohms per yard. 54577. will give ohms per mile. 62918. will give ohms per nautical mile. 3416825. divided by d&apos; will give ohms per pound. 0.0967447 multiplied by d² will give feet per ohm. As a copper wire becomes warm, so does its resistance increase. Between the freezing and boiling points of water this ratio is very nearly fixed. For practical purposes the resistance of a copper wire may be said to increase .215 of 1 per cent. for every degree Fahrenheit. The weight of a wire is directly, and the resistance inversely, proportional to the square of its diame- ter, the resistance of a wire varies in- versely as the section, and, therefore, inversely as the square of the diameter, and also inversely as to the weight of a given length. It also varies directly as to the length of a given weight. &quot; &quot;li PHONE CONNECTION GUST. SEABERG Manufacturer of ELEVATORS AND DUMBWAITERS 407 DOUGLASS STREET Near 5th Avenue BROOKLYN, N.

ARTICLE 5.. State Insurance Fund. Sec. 90. Creation of state fund. There is hereby created a fund to be known as &amp;quot;The State Insurance Fund,&amp;quot; for the purpose of insuring employers against liability under this chapter and of as-- suring to the persons entitled there- to the compensation provided by this chapter. Such fund shall consist of all premiums received and paid into the fund, of property and securities ac- quired by and through the use of moneys belonging to the fund and of interest earned upon moneys belonging to the fund and deposited or invested as herein provided. Such fund shall be administered by the commission with- out liability on the part of the state be- yond the amount of such fund. Such fund shall be applicable to the payment of losses sustained on account of insur- ance and to the payment of expenses in the manner provided in this chapter. Sec. 91. State treasurer custodian of fund. The state treasurer shall be the custodian of the state insurance fund; and all disbursements there- from shall be paid by him upon vouchers authorized by the com- mission and signed by any two mem- bers thereof. The state treasurer shall give a separate and additional bond in an amount to be fixed by the governor and with sureties approved by the state comptroller conditioned for the faithful performance of his duty as cus- todian of the state fund. The state treasurer may deposit any portion of the state fund not needed for imme- diate use, in the manner and subject to all the provisions of law respecting the deposit of other state funds by him. Interest earned by such portion of the state insurance fund deposited by the state treasurer shall be collected by him and placed to the credit of the fund. Sec. 92. Surplus and reserve. Ten per centum of the premiums collected from employers insured in the fund shall be set aside by the commission for the creation of a surplus until such surplus shall amount to the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, and thereafter five per centum of such premiums, until such time as in the judgment of the commis- sion such surplus shall be sufficiently large to cover the catastrophe hazard. The commission shall also set up and maintain a reserve adequate to meet anticipated losses and carry all claims and policies to maturity. Sec. 93. Investment of surplus or re- serve. The commission may, pursuant to a resolution of the commission ap- proved by the comptroller, invest any of the surplus or reserve funds belong- ing to the state insurance fund in the same securities and investments author- ized for investment by savings banks. All such securities or evidences of in- debtedness shall be placed in the hands of the state treasuer, who shall be the cutodian thereof. He shall collect the principal and interest thereof, when due, and pay the same into the state insurance fund. The state treasurer shall pay all vouchers drawn on the state insurance fund for the making of such investments when signed by two members of the commission, upon de- livery of such securities or evidences of indebtedness to him, when there is attached to such vouchers a certified copy of the resolution of the commis- sion authorizing the investment. The commission may, upon like resolution approved by the comptroller, sell any of such securities. Sec. 94. Administration expense. The entire expense of administering the state insurance fund shall be paid in the first instance by the state, out of moneys appropriated therefor. In the month of January, nineteen hundred and eight- een, and annually thereafter in such month, the commission shall ascertain the just amount incurred by the com- mission during the preceding calendar year, in the administration of the state insurance fund exclusive of the expense for the examination, determination and and payment of claims, and shall re- fund such amount to the state treasury. If there be employees of the commis- sion other than the commissioners them- selves, and the secretary, whose time is devoted partly to the general work of the commission and partly to the work of the state insurance fund, and in case there is other expense which is incurred jointly on behalf of the general work of the commission and the state insur- ance fund, an equitable apportionment of the expense shall be made for such purpose and the part thereof which is applicable to the state insurance fund shall be chargeable thereto. As soon as practicable after December thirty- one, nineteen hundred and seventeen, and annually thereafter, the commission shall calculate the total administrative expense incurred during the preceding calendar year in connection with the ex- amination, determination and payment of claims and the percentage which this expense bore to the total compensation payments made during that year. percentage so calculated and determined shall be assessed against the insurance carriers including the state fund as an addition to the payments required from them in the settlement of claims during the year immediately following, and the amounts so secured shall be transferred The &quot; &apos; xxvii Telephones {7842 Main THOMAS DRYSDALE Building Contractor 26 COURT STREET, BROOKLYN, N.

All exterior, or divi- sion walls of buildings hereafter erected, shall be of sufficient thickness to sup- port the load to be carried; but in no case shall a brick, stone, concrete or hollow block wall be less than 12 inches thick. Walls, excepting party and fire walls, for all buildings of other than the dwell- ing house class, not exceeding five stories or 65 feet in height, shall have the up- per two stories not less than 12 inches thick, increasing 4 inches in thickness for each two stories or fraction thereof Delow. For such buildings in excess of five stories, but not exceeding ten stories, or 125 feet in height, the top story shall be not less than 12 inches thick, measuring 4 inches in thickness for each two stories or fraction thereof below. No two story increment shall ex- ceed 30 feet in height. For all walls of buildings of the dwell- ing house class, the upper three stories shall be not less than 12 inches thick, increasing 4 inches in thickness for each three stories or fraction thereof below. No three story increment shall exceed 45 feet in height. Walls in skeleton construction shall be of brick, stone or stone concrete. They shall be supported by girders at each story, shall be laid in portland cement mortar and shall be not less than 12 inches thick. In all buildings, except dwellings, frame buildings and skeleton construc- tion, party walls and fire walls which serve as bearing walls on both sides, shall not be less than 16 inches thick in the upper two stories or upper 30 feet, increasing 4 inches in thickness for each two stories or fraction thereof be- low. All other fire walls shall not be less than 16 inches thick in the upper four stories or upper 50 feet, increas- ing 4 inches in thickness for each two stories or fraction thereof below. No two story increment shall exceed 30 feet in height. Portland cement mortar only shall be used in such walls. Reinforced stone or gravel concrete walls with the steel reinforcement run- ning both horizontally and vertically and weighing not less than one-half pound per square foot of wall, may have a thickness 4 inches less than that pre- scribed for brick walls. Stone walls shall be 4 inches thicker than required for brick walls. The foundation walls of all buildings over two stories in height shall be 4 inches thicker from footing to grade than required for the remainder of the wall. All exterior, and division or party walls over one story high, shall extend the full thickness of top story to at least 2 feet above the roof surfacing of a building as a parapet and be properly coped, excepting walls which face on a street and are finished with incombusti- ble cornices, gutters or crown mould- ings, excepting also the walls of detach- ed private dwellings, with peaked or hip- ped roofs. The parapet walls of ware- houses and all manufacturing or com- mercial buildings shall extend 3 feet above the roof. Fire walls shall be con- tinuous from foundation to 3 feet above roof level, and be coped. Hollow blocks of terra cotta or con- crete when used for bearing walls shall nave not more than 50 per cent of cell- ular space. Portland cement only shall be used in the manufacture of concrete blocks. The coarse aggregate shall be of suitable material graded in size, but in no case shall the maximum dimen- sion exceed one-half the minimum width of any section of the finished block. Con. crete blocks shall not be used in con- struction until they have attained the age of 28 days, or developed the strength required in this section. All building blocks shall be laid in portland cement mortar. The compressive strength of building blocks shall in all cases be calculated upon the gross or area of the bedding faces, no account being taken of the cellular spaces. The average ultimate compressive strength for terra cotta blocks laid with cells vertical shall be not less than 1200 lbs. per square inch; the average for concrete blocks laid with cells vertical shall be not less than 800 pounds per square inch. Concrete blocks shall be not more than 36 days old when tested. The average strength of the blocks as here given shall be ob- tained by testing ten blocks of average quality. The allowable working stress of hol- low building blocks shall not exceed 100 pounds per square inch of gross area for terra cotta blocks, or 75 pounds per square inch of gross area for concrete blocks. If a wall be built of blocks with the cells horizontal, the allowable work- ing stress shall not exceed 30 pounds per square inch of gross area. All walls and partitions in schools, hos- pitals and places of public assemblage, over one story high, and all walls and partitions in theatres, shall hereafter be built of brick, stone, hollow or solid blocks, or metal lath and portland cement plastered on metal studding, or &quot; &quot;176 Tenement House Law New Tenements Lots 100 feet or more deep.

(Yards of Corner Lots.)-The depth of the yard behind every tenement house hereafter erected upon a corner lot shall be not less than ten feet in every part, provided that where such lot is less than one hundred feet in depth, the depth of the yard may be not less than ten per centum of the depth of such lot, but shall never be less than five feet in every part, nor less than the minimum width of an outer court on the lot line as prescribed by section fifty-seven, sub- division one, of this chapter. Where a tenement house here- after erected on a corner lot has no basement and the cellar ceiling is not more than two feet above the curb level, said yard may start at the level of the second tier of beams. Where a corner lot is more than fifty feet in width, the yard for that portion in excess of fifty feet shall conform to the provisions of section fifty-three of this chapter. In the case of a gore- shaped corner lot where the width of the lot at the rear lot line is greater than the width at the front and the average width of the lot does not exceed fifty feet, the average width through the center shall be taken for the purposes of the aforesaid provision. Sec. 54-a. (Retaining Walls in Yards and Courts.)—When- ever the department charged with the enforcement of this chapter shall certify that because of temporary conditions of differences in grade with abutting lots at the rear or side, and that it is necessary to protect the adjoining premises by build- ing retaining walls; and whenever said department shall be satisfied that permission cannot be obtained to build such re- taining walls on the abutting premises, and that reasonable efforts have been made to obtain such permission, the said department may permit the building of retaining walls on the premises on which the tenement house is to be erected without having such walls considered as reducing the minimum sizes of yards or courts required by this article, nor as reducing the percentage of lot permitted to be occupied, provided that such retaining walls do not encroach upon such minimum dimensions of yards or courts more than twenty-four inches, nor extend in height above the first story window sills, and provided further, that there are no living rooms below such first story window sills except those necessary for the janitor and his family, and provided also that no such walls shall encroach upon a court if there are living rooms of any kind either for the janitor or any one, opening on such court below the level of such window sills.

(Yard Spaces of Lots Running Through from Street to Street.)-Wherever a tenement house hereafter erected is upon a lot which runs through from one street to an- other street, and said lot is not less than seventy feet nor more than one hundred and five feet in depth, there shall be a yard space through the centre of the lot midway between the two streets, which space shall extend across the full width of the lot and shall never be less than twelve feet in depth from wall to wall, and shall be increased in depth as prescribed in section fifty-three of this chapter. But where such building has no basement and the cellar ceiling is not more than two feet above the curb level, such yard space may start at the level of the second tier of beams. Where such lot is over one hundred and five feet in depth such yard space shall be left through the centre of the lot midway between the two streets, and shall extend across the entire width of the lot, and shall not be less than twenty-four feet in depth from wall to wall, and shall be increased in depth as prescribed in section fifty-three of this chapter. In a fireproof tenement house hereafter erected one or more po བྱ་ལམ་བ༦་ elevators are provided and operated, where such tenement house runs through from one street to another street, the two portions of the building may be connected and the yard be- &quot; &quot;Labor Law 203 ARTICLE VI. Sec. 79. Elevators and Hoistways. 1. Inclosure of shafts.

I. A. and the New York Board of Fire Underwriters, prepared by a committee on Co- operation composed of Julius Francke, representing the New York Chapter, and F. J. T. Stewart, representing the N. Y. Board of Fire Underwriters. NOTE: The purpose of this pamphlet is to disseminate among architects, builders and property owners an outline of the main points in the science of fire prevention and protection, and to indicate where detailed information of these important subjects may easily be obtained. The New York Chapter and the Underwriters have co-operated in this matter not only that the property owner may thereby be benefited in regard to his insurance, but also to stimulate the adoption of higher standards of construction and equipment. It is hardly necessary to call the attention of technical men to the enormous fire waste of our country, amounting to more than two hundred million dollars annually. This subject is now attracting much attention and thought here and abroad. Exhaustive tests of fire resistive materials and fire extinguishing apparatus of one kind or another are being conducted daily under scientific management. The record and results of these are carefully kept and generally published. Tests to establish the relative fire haz- ard of materials and devices for insur- ance purposes in the United States are generally made in Chicago by the Underwriters&apos; Laboratories, Inc., an in- stitution supported by the stock fire in- surance companies of the United States. In England the tests are made chiefly in London under the auspices of the British Fire Prevention Committee, which is supported by subscription. The members of this Committee are mainly architects and builders. The Underwrit- ers&apos; Laboratories also maintain an of- fice in London. In addition to general standards adopted by the insurance companies for structural parts, such as for walls, floors and fireproofing, there are also stand- rds for fire doors, wired glass windows and doors and new structural materials. These standards have generally been es- tablished as a result of fire tests or by the recommendations of the National Fire Protection Association. The purpose of the National Fire Pro- tection Association is &amp;quot;to promote the science and improve the methods of fire protection and prevention; to obtain and circulate information on these subjects and to secure the co-operation of its members in establishing proper safe- guards against loss of life and property by fire.&amp;quot; Many specific devices and materials made to conform to approved specifica- tions are tested and approved by the Underwriters&apos; Laboratories. Inspection is also made at the shops of manufac- turers, and labels issued by the Under- writers Laboratories as evidence of com- pliance with standards, are affixed to the appliances. Architects and builders may thus specify and procure inspected and &amp;quot;labeled&amp;quot; fire doors, windows, fire shut- ters, stair and elevator doors, rolling shutters and hardware, electrical wire, fusible links for doors, watchman&apos;s clocks, hose, waste cans, brooders, incu- bators and various other structural parts, devices or materials affecting the fire hazard. Information in regard to these labels is contained in a pamphlet issued by the Underwriters&apos; Laboratories, Inc., April, 1913, and entitled &amp;quot;General Information in Reference to Its Organization, Its Purposes and Its Methods.&amp;quot; Facsimiles of the labels are given in the pamphlet. Lists which are revised semi-annually are also published giving names of the makers of devices and materials which have been examined by the Under- writers&apos; Laboratories and found to com- ply with the standards. There are three such lists, which may be obtained from any insurance representative. Among the other subjects listed in this Appendix the special pamphlet (21) de- scriptive of the National Fire Protection Association and giving a complete list of its publications should be in the refer- ence files of architects or others interest- ed in fire prevention. Broadly speaking, there are six im- portant considerations which enter into the &amp;quot;hazard&amp;quot; in fire insurance, and like- wise in the science of fire prevention and protection, viz.: I. Exposure to Fire From Without: The architect may have little to do with this, as the site is generally chosen be- fore he is called in. The exposure de- pends upon the width of streets or courts, the space between the new build- ings and the neighboring buildings, and the nature of such neighboring buildings. This hazard may be reduced however if the building is planned without open- ings facing the danger, or if wired glass windows, shutters, doors and skylights facing such exposure furnish standard protection. Outside sprinklers and fire hydrants can also be provided to reduce the danger. &quot; &quot;72 Building Code Sec. 75. (Stairs, Number Regulated by Area of Building.) In any building hereafter erected to be used as a STORE, FACTORY, HOTEL OR LODGING-HOUSE, covering a lot area exceeding two thousand five hundred feet and not exceeding five thousand feet, there shall be provided at least two continuous lines of stairs remote from each other; and every such building shall have at least one con- tinuous line of stairs for each five thousand feet of lot area covered, or part thereof, in excess of that required for five thousand feet of area. When any such building covers an area of lot greater than fifteen thousand feet the number of stairs shall be increased proportionately, or as will meet the approval of the Commisioner of Buildings having jurisdiction. Sec. 76. (Engineers&apos; Stationary Ladders.) OUTSIDE EXIT.-Every building in which boilers or machinery are placed in the cellar or lowest story, shall have stationary iron ladders or stairs from such story leading direct to a manhole above on the sidewalk, or other outside exit.

BULKHEAD.-At least one flight of such stairs in each of said building shall extend to the roof, and be inclosed in a bulkhead built of fireproof materials. STAIRHALLS. The said halls and stairways shall have a connecting fire- proof hallway inclosed with suitable walls of brick or such other fireproof materials including the ceiling in all cases, as may be approved by the Commissioner of Buildings having jurisdiction, the first story and extend to the street. Sec. 54. PART VIII. Vaults, Areas and Sewers. (Cellars to Be Connected With Sewers.) Before the walls of buildings are carried up above the foundation walls the cellar shall be connected with the street sewers. Should there be no sewer in the street, or if the cellars are below water level, or below the sewer level, then provision shall be made by the owner to prevent water accumulating in the cellars to the injury of the foundations. Sec. 55. (Vaults Under Sidewalks.)

This issue of the Year Book contains all the new laws and amendments to existing laws which were enacted during the year. It also contains many new features and some changes to last year&apos;s issue in the arrangement of subjects and other details to meet the views of the members of the Society. Among the new laws are the State Housing Law for Cities of the Second Class; the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Law; the Industrial Board Rules and Reg- ulations for factories; the amendments to the Labor Law in regard to Factories and Mercantile Establishments in the State; and some amendments to the New York City Charter extending the powers of the Fire Prevention Bureau, the Board of Estimate and Apportionment in regard to the heights of buildings and districting the city into zones; and also some Ordinances by the Board of Al- dermen, affecting Signs and Fences which seem to conflict with some provisions of the Electric Sign Ordinance, and a change in the Building Code, affecting Dumb Waiters. At the request of the members we publish the Arbitration Law of the State; Fire Insurance Requirements by the National Board of Fire Under- writers; a Building Ordinance for Villages and small cities compiled by the National Fire Protection Association, the National Board of Fire Underwriters and the American Institute of Architects. The Lectures delivered to the Society during the year by Mr. A. M. Feld- man, on &amp;quot;Ventilating of Buildings;&amp;quot; by Mr. C. M. Ripley, on &amp;quot;The Life of Private Electric Plants,&amp;quot; and by Mr. Thaddeus W. Vaness, on &amp;quot;The Legal Rela- tions of Architect, Client and Contractor;&amp;quot; have been condensed by the authors for publication in the Year Book. In regard to the New Laws-The State Housing Law was amended by de- ferring the date on which it was to take effect to January 1, 1915, and by the appointment of a Commission to report amendments to the next Legislature; the Building Committee of the Board of Aldermen have engaged Mr. Rudolph P. Miller, Superintendent of the Bureau of Buildings, as expert in framing the new Building Code; the Board also has before it the revision of the Fire Limits of New York City; the Industrial Board is holding &amp;quot;hearings&amp;quot; to further amend the Labor Law; and the Mayor is about to appoint a Commission to revise the Charter for New York City, and a Constitutional Convention will be held. The New York Society is committed to the consolidation of all building matters into one department. This is a matter which not only affects the con- venience of architects and their clients, but affects the general public as tax- payers. The development of the city is influenced by the architect, and he owes his best and most thoughtful efforts to its economical administration and to its growth, his chief responsibility is co-operation in all movements where the value of his training will benefit the City and the State.

TOWNER, Year Book Committee. &quot; &apos;Elevators 134 control all doors without leaving the car control, more than one opening will be permitted on a floor. 7. In all cases where the law or regu- lations permit grille-work enclosing the shaft or car, it shall be of substantial material and construction, properly braced and carried the full height of openings, and there shall not be more than one and one-half inch space be- tween any two members of said grille- work except where plain straight bars are used, not filled in with scroll, when there shall not be more than one inch space between members. 8. All doors or gates leading to any elevator shaft shall be locked or bolted on the shaft side so as to be opened only by the operator of the car, and said shaft doors or gates and car gates shali be closed before the car is put in motion. 9. All entrances to elevator cars must be provided with substantial folding or sliding gates or doors, and where floor tracks are used the same must be coun- tersunk. All folding gates over three feet wide at entrance to shaft or car shall have top and bottom centre braces. 10. All counterweights shall have their sections strongly bolted together. There shall not be less than three feet clearance between the top of counter- weights and the under side of overhead beams when the car is resting on the bumpers. No continuous forged straps shall be permitted on counterweights. 11. Where counterweights run in the same shaft as the car, they must be pro- tected with a substantial screen of iron from the top of rail to a point fifteen feet below, except where the plunger or traction type of elevator is used. 12. All elevators, except direct plun- ger elevators and freight elevators hav- ing a rise of fifteen feet or less, shall have a governor or speed regulator properly connected to the safety devices on the car, in such a manner that the car will be brought to rest with an easy and gradual stop, or in a distance not greater than eight for a speed of seven hundred feet per minute, except that on elevators having a speed of one hundred feet per minute or less safeties of the instantaneous type may be used. Every elevator operating on alternating cur- rent electricity shall be equipped with an electro mechanical brake, or some such device as will insure the brake be- ing applied at any time should the cur- rent be interrupted from the service. All electric car controlling devices shall be self-centering and self-locking in in- operative position. All hoisting ma- chines of the drum type shall have an automatic slack cable device that will stop the machine if the hoist or drum weight cables shall become slack from any cause. All elevators shall have upper and lower limit devices on the machine or in the shaft. No elevator shall be used for the carrying of safes or other material of a greater weight than the normal lifting power of such elevator, unless the car is equipped with a locking device which will hold it fixed at any landing independent of the ropes while such safe or other material is be- ing loaded or unloaded. 13. The car of all elevators must be constructed of incombustible materials, except that interior trim and flooring may be of hardwood. There shall be not more than one and one-quarter inches space between the floor of the car and the floor saddles, and where the saddles project into the shaft, the same shall be properly bevelled on the under side. The under side of the car must be of incombustible materials. Cars for all elevators shall be properly lighted. 14. All guide rails for both car and counterweights shall be of iron or steel, and shall be fastened to the sides of the shaft with wrought or cast iron brack- ets, so spaced that the guide rails will be rigid. 15. There shall be not less than two cables, independently connected to the car and to each set of counterweights. The lifting and weight cables shall have at least one full turn of cable on the drum when they have reached the limit of travel. Such cables shall be of a diameter to insure a factor of safety of five. All cables used in the opera- tion of elevators shall be of steel, iron or &quot;marlin&quot; covered. Where overhead machines are installed, the use of equal- izer arms will be permitted on the car and counterweights. 16. No elevator shall be permitted to have attached above, below or on the inside of the car, a freight compartment or similar device. 17. Immediately under the sheaves at the top of every elevator shaft in any building, there shall be provided and placed a substantial grating of iron or steel having not more than one and one- half inch space between any two mem- bers of said grating, and of such con- struction as shall be approved by the Bureau of Buildings. 18. A clear space of not less than three feet must be provided between the bottom of the shaft and the lowest point of the underside of the car floor when the car is at its lowest landing, &apos; &quot;Building Code 97 Sec. 135. (Weights of Certain Materials.) In computing the weight of walls, a cubic foot of brickwork shall be deemed to weigh one hundred and fifteen pounds. Sandstone, white marble, granite and other kinds of building stone shall be deemed to weigh one hundred and seventy pounds per cubic foot. Sec. 136. (Computations for Strength of Materials.) The dimensions of each piece or combination of materials required shall be ascertained by computation, according to the rules prescribed by this code. Sec. 137. (Factors of Safety.) Where the unit stress for any material is not prescribed in this code the relation of allowable unit stress to ultimate strength shall be as one to four for metals, subjected to tension or transverse stress; as one to six for timber, and as one to ten for natural or artificial stones and brick or stone masonry. But wherever working stresses are prescribed in this code, varying the factors of safety hereinabove given, the said working stresses shall be used. Sec. 138. (Strength of Columns.) In columns or compression members with flat ends of cast iron, steel, wrought iron or wood, the stress per square inch shall not exceed that given in the follow- ing tables: Working stresses per square inch of section When the length divided by least radius of gyration equals: Wrought Cast iron.

Five-eighths the value given for white pine shall also apply to chestnut and hemlock posts. For locust posts use one and one-half the value given for white pine. Columns and compression members shall not be used having an unsupported length of greater ratio than given in the tables. Any column eccentrically loaded shall have the stresses caused by such eccentricity computed, and the combined stresses resulting from such eccentricity at any part of the column, added to all other stresses at that part, shall in no case exceed the working streses stated in this code. The eccentric load of a column shall be considered to be distributed equally over the entire area of that column at the next point below at which the column is securely braced laterally in the direction of the eccentricity. Sec. 139. (Working Stresses.) The safe carrying capacity of the various materials of construction (except in the case of columns) shall be determined by the following working stresses in pounds per square inch of sectional area: &quot; &quot;lxii Sec.

Definitions.-Meaning of terms. The following terms when used in this article shall have the following meaning: 1. Fireproof construction. A building shall be deemed to be of fireproof construction if it conforms to the following requirements: All walls constructed of brick, stone, concrete or terra-cotta; all floors and roofs of brick, terra-cotta or reinforced concrete placed between steel or reinforced concrete beams and girders; all the steel entering into the structural parts encased in at least two inches of fireproof material, excepting the wall columns, which must be encased in at least eight inches of masonry on the outside and four inches on the inside; all stair-wells, elevator wells, public hallways and corridors enclosed by fireproof partitions; all doors fireproof; all stairways, landings, hallways and other floor surfaces of incombustible material; no woodwork or other combustible material used in any partition, furring, ceiling or floor; and all window frames, doors and sash, trim and other interior finish of incombustible material; all windows shall be fireproof windows except that in buildings under seventy feet in height fire- proof windows are required only when within thirty feet of another building or opening on a court or space less than thirty feet wide; except that in buildings under one hundred feet in height there may be wooden sleepers and floor finish and wooden trim, and except that in buildings under one hundred and fifty feet in height heretofore constructed there may be wooden sleepers, floor finish and trim and the windows need not be fireproof windows, excepting when such win- dows are within thirty feet of another building. 2. Fireproof material is material which is incombustible and is capable of resisting the effect of fire in such manner and to such extent as to insure the safety of the occupants of the building. The industrial board shall determine and in its rules and regulations shall specify what materials are fireproof materials within the meaning hereof. 3. Incombustible material is material which will not burn or support com- bustion. 4. A fire wall is a wall constructed of brick, concrete, terre-cotta blocks or reinforced stone concrete, and having at each floor level one or more openings each protected by fire doors so constructed as to prevent the spread of fire or smoke through the openings. In buildings of non-fireproof construction fire walls shall be at least twelve inches in thickness and shall extend continuously from the cellar floor through the entire building and at least three feet over the roof and be coped; except that walls heretofore erected not less than eight inches in thick- ness, but otherwise conforming to the requirements of this subdivision shall be considered fire walls within the meaning of this subdivision. No opening in such wall shall exceed sixty-six inches in width or sixty square feet in area, except that where openings not exceeding eight feet in width exist in fire walls heretofore erected, such walls may be considered fire walls within the meaning of this sub- division, and in the case of fire walls hereafter constructed no two openings in the same wall and at the same floor level shall be nearer than forty feet from the center of one opening to the center of another. Every opening in a fire wall shall be protected by a fire door closing automatically on each side of the wall. At every opening in the fire wall there shall be an incombustible floor finish ex- tending over the floor for the full thickness of the wall so as to completely sep- arate the woodwork of the floors on each side of the fire wall. In fireproof build- ings the fire walls shall comply with the foregoing requirements in all respects excepting that they may be of the thickness required by the provisions of this section with respect to fireproof partitions; such fire walls and fireproof partitions shall be continuous, from the cellar floor to the under side of the fireproof roof. 5. Fireproof partitions shall be built of brick, concrete, reinforced concrete or terra-cotta blocks. When built of brick or concrete they shall be not less than eight inches in thickness for the uppermost forty feet, and shall increase four inches in thickness for each additional lower forty feet or part thereof; or, when wholly supported by suitable steel framing at vertical intervals of not over forty feet, they may be eight inches in thickness throughout their entire height. When wholly supported at vertical intervals of not over twenty-five feet, and built of porous terra-cotta blocks, they shall be not less than six inches in thickness and when so supported and built of reinforced stone concrete, they shall be not less than four inches in thickness. The supporting steel framework shall be properly encased on all sides by not less than two inches of fireproof material, securely fastened to the steel work. All openings in such partitions shall be provided with fire doors. 6. Fire doors. Fire doors shall be metal covered doors, or doors of such other material as shall be specified in the rules and regulations of the industrial board. They shall be provided with self-closing devices and have incombustible sills. The industrial board shall determine, and in its rules and regulations shall &quot; &apos;XXX Established 1885 Artistic High Grade Metal Ceilings and Walls We place ourselves at your service to furnish sketches, estimates, and advice for the material, or the work put up complete and decorated.

The average width of a shingle is four inches; hence when laid four inches to the weather, each shingles averages sixteen square inches, and 900 are required for a square of roofing. If 42 inches to the weather, 800 will cover a square. If 5 inches to the weather, 720 will cover a square. If 5½ inches to the weather, 655 will cover a square. If 6 inches to the weather, 600 will cover a square. In hip roofs where cutting is required for hips and valleys add five per cent. to the above figures. &quot; &quot;68 Building Code LEAST THICKNESS. No wood floor beams or wood roof beams used in any building, hereafter erected, shall be of a less thickness than three inches. All wood trimmer and header beams shall be proportioned to carry with safety the loads they are intended to sustain. STIRRUP IRONS.-Every wood header or trimmer more than four feet long, used in any building, shall be hung in stirrup-irons of suitable thickness for the size of the timbers. BEARING. Every wood beam, except header and tail beams, shall rest at one end four inches in the wall or upon the girder as authorized by this code. The ends of all wood floor and roof beams, where they rest in brick walls, shall be cut to a bevel of three inches on their depth. In no case shall either end of a floor or roof beam be supported on stud partitions, except in frame buildings. BRIDGING.-All wood floor and wood roof beams shall be properly bridged with cross bridging, and the distance between bridging or between bridging and walls shall not exceed eight feet. BEAMS NEAR FLUES.-All wood beams shall be trimmed away from all flues and chimneys, whether the same be a smoke, air or any other flue or chim- ney. The trimmer beam shall not be less than eight inches from the inside face of a flue and four inches from the outside of a chimney breast, and the header beam not less than two inches from the outside face of the brick or stone work of the same; except that for the smoke flues of boilers and furnaces where the brickwork is required to be eight inches in thickness, the trimmer beams shall be not less than twelve inches from the inside of the flue. HEADER FOR TRIMMER ARCH.-The header beam, carrying the tail beams of a floor, and supporting the trimmer arch in front of a fireplace, shall be not less than twenty inches from the chimney breast. FORMULA, WOOD BEAMS.-The safe carrying capacity of wood beams for uniformly distributed loads shall be determined by multiplying the area in square inches by its depth in inches and dividing this product by the span of the beam in feet. This result is to be multiplied by seventy for hemlock, ninety for spruce and white pine, one hundred and twenty for oak, and by one hundred and forty for yellow pine. SHORT SPAN BEAMS.-The safe carrying capacity of short span timber beams shall be determined by their resistance to shear in accordance with the unit stresses fixed by section 139 of this code. Sec. 60. (Anchors and Straps for Wood Beams and Girders.) WALL ANCHORS.-Each tier of beams shall be anchored to the side, front, rear or party walls at intervals of not more than six feet apart, with good strong, wrought iron anchors of not less than one and a half inches by three-eighths of an inch in size, well fastened to the side of the beams by two or more nails made of wrought iron at least one-fourth of an inch in diameter. GIRDER STRAPS AND ANCHORS.-Where the beams are supported by girders, the girders shall be anchored to the walls and fastened to each other by suitable iron straps. The ends of wood beams resting upon girders shall be butted together end to end and strapped by wrought iron straps of the same size and distance apart, and in the same beam as the wall anchors, and shall be fastened in the same manner as said wall anchors. Or they may lap each other at least twelve inches and be well spiked or bolted together where lapped. ANCHOR STRAPS.-Each tier of beams front and rear, opposite each pier, shall have hard wood anchor strips dovetailed into the beams diagonally, which strips shall cover at least four beams and be one inch thick and four inches wide, but no such anchor strips shall be let in within four feet of the centre line of the beams; or wood strips may be nailed on the top of the beams and kept in place until the floors are being laid. PIER ANCHORS.-Every pier and wall, front or rear, shall be well anchored to the beams of each story with the same size anchors as are required for side walls, which anchors shall hook over the fourth beam. Sec. 61. (Wood Columns and Plates.) CAP, BASE AND CHEEK PLATES.-All timber columns shall be squared at the ends perpendicular to their axis. To prevent the unit stresses from exceeding those fixed in this code, timber or iron cap and base plates shall be provided. Additional iron cheek plates shall be placed between the cap and base plates and bolted to the girders when required to transmit the loads with safety. &quot; &quot;14 Schedule of Charges of Certificates for payments on Con- tracts. Upon the execution of any and all Building Contracts, there shall become due to the Architects, on account of the Regular Services, the minimum Commis- sion therefor, of 6% of the total cost, less the previous payments made there- on, the balance of which Commission ap- plicable to the Supervision, shall be paid in installments of 1.5%, based upon the gross amount of such Certificate issued by them to the Contractors. The aggre- gate of the foregoing five divisions here- of constitutes the Regular Services, for which the minimum Commission is 6%, and which services shall be performed in conformity with the stipulations herein. Plans and Specifications.--The Archi- tects&apos; Regular Services shall include the preparation of the Owner&apos;s criticism, correction or approval, one set of Pre- liminary Drawings; one set of Small Scale Plans with Specifications, and one set of Details, and after their approval, they shall prepare therefrom, one set of cloth Tracings of the Small Scale Plans, and cloth or paper Tracings of the De- tails, after which they shall also furn- ish the necessary prints of Small Scale Plans for filing in the Building Depart- ment; one set for submission to the Fire Department; Three Sets with Specifica- tions, to be attached to and accompany the Three Copies of the Contracts for Signatures; one complete, signed set shall be retained by the Owner, one by the Architects and one by the Contract- ors, after which three additional sets of prints of the Small Scale Drawings and three sets of Specifications, and one set of prints of the Details shall be supplied by the Architects for the use of Con- tractors. Commissions. Until the actual esti- mates are received from the Contractors, all Commissions shall be computed upon the Architects&apos; estimated total cost or value of the completed Building Im- provement, based at the time, on the market value, of new Materials and Union Labor throughout, of the quality stipulated, to which must be added the Contractor&apos;s profits, Expert or other ex- penses chargeable to the Owner and the cost or value of all articles designed or purchased with the advice or assistance of the Architects. Disputes.--Should any disputes arise with Contractors, the Architects shall estimate the probable cost and render a written statement to the Owner, the bal- ances due to the Architects shall be com- puted on that basis and be promptly paid to them by the Owner, pending the settlement of such disputes, when they shall be readjusted upon the basis of the actual amounts. Suspension or Abandonment.-In case of the Temporary or Indefinite Suspen- sion, or the Abandonment of a Building Improvement, the Architects&apos; Commis- sions, as stipulated elsewhere herein, shall become due and payable. Payments. All payments received by the Architects, shall be construed and credited as payments on account of the Entire Commissions for Regular Archi- tectural Services and shall be audited and adjusted on final settlement. Traveling. All necessary or advisa- ble Traveling expenses, Hotel bills and other outside expenses, incured by the Architects, in the execution of a Build- ing Improvement, shall be promptly re- imbursed by the Owner. Interest shall be charged on all bal- ances, from their due dates, at the legal rate in force in the State in which the Building Improvement is located. Changes or Modifications made by the Owner in any of the Drawings, Specfica- tions, Documents, etc., after their ap- proval, by the Owner, shall be promptly executed by the Architects and the ad- ditional charges therefor shall be de- frayed by the Owner. as men- Expert Services.-The before tioned Regular minimum Commission of 6%, does not include the Services of any Experts or Specialists. On import- ant Building Improvements where the Architects acting agents for the Owner, encounter Foundation, Water, Steel, Structural, or other Engineering Problems; Heating, Ventilating, Power, Electrical or other Mechanical Projiems; Sanitation or other Special Problems; or where Chemical or other Tests or Sur- veys, Borings, Audits, etc., are advisa- ble, the Architects, should they deem it advisable or to the Owner&apos;s interest, they are authorized to select and retain for the Owner&apos;s account, the services of such Experts or Specialists as they may construe the exigency to require and all the expenses thereof shall be defrayeu by the Owner, in addition to the Regular Commissions of the Architects. All such services shall be considered a part of the cost of the Building Improvement. Clerk-of-the-Works.-The before men- tioned Regular minimum Commission of 6%, includes only the Architects&apos; Gen- eral Supervision, to the extent stipulated under that head herein, and does not. include the constant personal Supervi- sion of a Clerk-of-the-works. On im- portant Building Improvements, where the Architects acting as agents for the Owner, deem it advisable to so protect the Owner&apos;s interest, they are author- ized to select and retain for the Owner&apos;s account, the services of such Clerk-of- the-works, as they may construe te exi- gency to require, and all the expenses thereof, shall be defrayed by the Owner, &quot; &apos;Tenement House Law 171 Sec. 26.

Sec. 98. Time of payment of pre- miums. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, all premiums shall be paid by every employer into the state Insurance fund on or before July first, nineteen hundred and fourteen, and semi-annually thereafter, or at such other time or times as may be pre- scribed by the commission. The com- mission shall mail a receipt for the same to the employer and place the same to the credit of the state insurance fund in the custody of the state treas- urer. ac- Sec. 99. Action for collection in case of default. If an employer shall default in any payment required to be made by him to the state insur- ance fund, the amount due from him shall be collected by civil tion against him in the name of the people of the state of New York, and it shall be the duty of the commission on the first Monday of each month after July first, nineteen hundred and four- teen, to certify to the attorney-general of the state the names and residences, or places of business, of all employers known to the commission to be in de- fault for such payment or payments for a longer period than five days and the amount due from such employer, and it shall then be the duty of the attorney- general forthwith to bring or cause to brought against each such employer a civil action in the proper court for the collection of such amount so due, and the same when collected, shall be paid into the state insurance fund, and such employer&apos;s compliance with the provi- sions of this chapter requiring payments to be made to the state insurance fund shall date from the time of the payment of said money so collected as aforesaid to the state treasurer for credit to the state insurance fund. Sec. 100. Withdrawal from fund. Any employer may, upon complying with sub- division two or three of section fifty of this chapter, withdraw from the fund by turning in his insurance contract for cancellation, provided he is not in ar- rears for premiums due the fund and has given to the commission written notice of his intention to withdraw with- in thirty days before the expiration of the period for which he has elected to insure in the fund; provided that in case any employer so withdraws, his liability to assessments shall, notwithstanding such withdrawal, continue for one year after the date of such withdrawal as against all liabilities for such compen- sation accruing prior to such withdrawal. Sec. 101. Audit of payrolls. Every employer who is insured in the state insurance fund shall keep a true and accurate record of the number of his employees and the wages paid by him, and shall furnish to the commis- sion, upon demand, a sworn statement of the same. Such record shall be open to inspection at any time and as often as the commission may require to verify the number of employees and the amount of the payroll. Sec. 102. Falsification of payroll. An employer who shall wilfully misrepre- sent the amount of the payroll upon which the premiums chargeable to the state insurance fund is to be based shall be liable to the state in ten times the amount of the difference between the premiums paid and the amount the em- ployer should have paid had his pay- roll been correctly computed; and the liability to the state under this sec- on shall be enforced in a civil action in the name of the state insurance fund, and any amount so collected shall be- come a part of such fund. Sec. 103. Wilful misrepresentation. Any person who wilfully misrepresents any fact in order to obtain insurance in the state insurance fund at less than the proper rate for such insurance, or in order to obtain payment out of such fund, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Sec. 104. Inspections. The commis- sion shall have the right to inspect the plants and establishments of employers insured in the state insurance fund; and the inspectors designated by the com- mission shall have free access to such premises during regular working hours. Sec. 105. Disclosures prohibited. In- formation acquired by the commission or its officers or employees from employ- ers or employees pursuant to this chap- ter shall not be opened to public in- spection, and any officer or employee of the commission who, without authority of the commission or pursuant to its rules or as otherwise required by law disclose the same shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. &quot; &quot;Legal Relations 285 He owes a most important duty to his client in the care he uses in the giving of certificates to the contractor. To begin with, the certificate should be made out only in the form authorized by the contract, to avoid question. If the certificate is not in proper form, a dissatisfied client may make it an excuse for refusing pay- ment, although he really owes the money; still at law he is justified in refusing payment, for the presentation of the certificate, in proper form is, if so agreed, a condition precedent to payment. At each stage of the structure, the superinten- dent should satisfy himself that the quantity of work done, the nature and quality of the work and the time requirements are all in accordance with the pact between the client and the contractor. Of course, if a defect is discovered, the architect should order it corrected at once. Otherwise, if objection is delayed, the fault, being within his knowledge, will be considered waived, and both he and the client whose agent he is will be helpless as against the contractor. The client, however, can recover his damages from the architect, viz., the decrease in value of the building. The last main relation to occupy us will be the duties of the contractor to the owner. Many of these have been given indirectly already, and I shall not bore you with a repetition of the general principles. But a reference to a few concrete exemplifications of them may be worth while. In a certain case, the contractor agreed with the owner to deliver the building on a specific date without reserva- tion. Partial payments had been made. Just before completion, the structure burned accidentally, and the time for completion passed. The owner sued for breach of contract and for the sums paid under the contract. Held that he could recover. The contractor was bound to deliver a completed building, and its loss was his loss, and having said that he would have it ready by a day certain, he was liable for not delivering it on that day, regardless of unforeseen circumstances. He should have allowed for such a possibility in his contract and have saved him- self from his quandary. If the building is lost through flood or storm, or other accident, the same principle rules. The contractor can recover nothing on the building, even if substantially completed, if not delivered over. The builder has the duty to deliver the structure within a reasonable time, or the time set by the contract, regardless of the fact that he becomes bankrupt, so that he cannot get materials, or that he struck rock in digging for his foundation, or that continual bad weather interfered with him. The leading case on this question came up at the time of the famous &amp;quot;Blizzard of 1888&amp;quot;-because of which a certain contractor was unable to complete in the time agreed. Whatever damage his delay caused fell on his own head. He should have provided for it in the contract. Nor will the acts of third parties release him from performance on time. The failure of a quarry to furnish stone seasonably, a strike among workmen, or the tardiness or errors of his sub-contractors, for instance, have been held not to excuse the contractor&apos;s delay. On the other hand, if the delay is to be ascribed to the owner or his agent, the architect, the builder is safe. Weeks v. Trinity Church, 56 App. Div. 195, holds that the failure of the owner to get the building permit excused such delay, and gave the contractor a right to damages against the owner. Dannat v. Fuller, 120 N. Y. 554, stands for the same proposition-the owner agreed to furnish timbers, which, however, were not ready until long after the agreed time; failure to have ready any materials to be furnished or to see that the work of other contractors is done in time for the plaintiff to begin excuses for his delay. I shall close this discussion with a reference to the right of the architect to compensation for the preparation of plans and for acting as supervisor of con- struction. If a man comes to you and says &amp;quot;I want you to draw me plans and make up specifications for such and such a house,&amp;quot; and you draw up plans in ac- cordance with his general directions, you are entitled to pay therefor, whether he accepts the plans or not. The amount of the money is the reasonable value of the plans and the services performed, a question of fact. This naturally presumes that the plans can be carried out practically and executed reasonably near the estimate given. The architect&apos;s fee is over and above the cost of the structure, and therefore needs not be included in the estimated cost of the building. In the ordinary competition, it is plain that an implied term of the agreement is that only that architect whose plans are accepted is entitled to compensation therefor. The client has the right to the ownership of the plans. Is the architect entitled to the ordinary mechanics lien against the building, first, for making the plans, second for his services as superintendent of con- struction? Rinn v. Electric Power Co., 3 App. Div. 305 is a leading case on this ques- tion. In that case the plaintiff was an architect and was employed to prepare plans and superintend the construction of a power house on Staten Island. His compensation was to be 5 per cent. on the cost of the structure, and expenses. &quot; &quot;Registration Bill 11 tical experience in the office or offices of a reputable architect or architects, com- mencing after the completion of the high school course.

The board of regents may revoke any certificate, if such action be recommended by the board of examiners, after thirty days&apos; written notice to the holder thereof and after a hearing before the board of examiners, upon proof that such certificate has been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, or upon proof that the holder of such certificate has been guilty of felony in connection with the practice of architecture. Sec. 79-b. Violation of Article. Any violation of this article shall be a misdemeanor, punishable for the first offense by a fine of not less than fifty and not more than one hundred dollars, and for a subsequent offense by a fine of not less than two hundred nor more than five hundred dollars, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. 2. This act shall take effect immediately. Architecture as an art, a science, and a business, is conducted by the architect upon a rule of action formed by each individual practitioner. Association has heretofore provided the best means for influencing this rule of action in the direction of improving the conduct and the practice. But asso- ciation in organizations formed for this very purpose has also had its effect in iso- lation by exclusion, and the great number of practitioners are left outside of the controlling influences for good in the profession. The isolated practitioner is fully conscious of this condition, and his responsi- bilities to the community are measured by his own standards-which are often high-but rarely controlled by the influences of association in organizations. The regulations by the State will supply some of the motives which underlie the influences of associations, and, the authority and prestige of recognition in an established profession will have its significance upon the entire body of associated and unaffiliated architects. &quot; &quot;Building Code 85 except for exit and entrance from and to the auditorium and stage, and must be kept free and clear during performances.

Sec. 74. Jurisdiction of commission to be continuing. The power and juris- diction of the commission over each case shall be continuing, and it may, from time to time, make such modifi- cations or change with respect to former findings or orders relating thereto, as in its opinion may be just. An- Sec. 75. Report of commission. nually on or before the first day of February, the commission shall make a report to the legislature, which shall in- clude a statement of the number of awards made by it and the causes of the accidents leading to the injuries for which the awards were made, a de- tailed statement of the expenses of the commission, the condition of the state insurance fund, together with any other matter which the commissioner deems proper to report to the legislature, in- cluding any recommendations it may desire to make.

Temporary partial disability. In case of temporary partial disability, ex- cept the particular cases mentioned in subdivision three of this section, an in- jured employee shall receive sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the differ- ence between his average weekly wages and his wage earning capacity thereafter in the same employment or otherwise during the continuance of such partial disability, but not in excess of three thousand five hundred dollars, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 5.

Previous disability. The fact that an employee has suffered previous dis- ability or received compensation therefor shall not preclude him from compensa- tion for a later injury nor preclude com- pensation for death resulting therefrom; but in determining compensation for the later injury or death his average weekly wages shall be such sum as will rea- sonably represent his earning capacity at the time of the later injury. Sec. 16. Death benefits. If the injury causes death, the compensation shall be known as a death benefit and shall be payable in the amount and to or for the benefit of the persons following: 1.

HOW TO GLAZE 4 lbs. to square foot 3½ lbs. to square foot 3½ lbs. to square foot lbs. to square foot lbs. to square foot Wood Sash Glazing. All glass should be thoroughly bedded in white lead putty. All wood doors, whether interior or exterior, should be bedded in putty. Where mouldings are used on wood sash the same should be thoroughly bedded and mouldings filled in. Regarding wood partition work, it is not necessary to bed glass in partitions. Doors should be bedded. On all wood glazing, glaziers&apos; points should be used according to size of glass and should be set about nine inches apart. Where glass runs over twenty-four by thirty inches white pine blocks should be used to act as a cushion. Kalamein Sash Glazing. Same as wood. Glazing in Iron. All glass should be thoroughly bedded with white lead putty or cement and white pine blocks should be used to act as a cushion on sizes running over sixteen by twenty inches. White Lead Putty. Where putty is required it should be mixed in the foi- lowing proportions: Pigment, eighty-six per cent.; oil, fourteen per cent. The pigment should be composed of ninety per cent. pure calcium carbonate and ten per cent. pure white carbonate of lead. Elastic Cement. All work set in iron or steel sash should be glazed with elastic cement. This cement sets faster, prevents running of the oil, and the putty holds the glass tighter and yet so constituted that there is enough elas- ticity or life left in the cement after hardening to take up the jar and minimiz✅ breakage. It is more water-proof for skylight glazing. There are several good elastic cements in the market. The following formula is known as Patton&apos;s Elastic Cement: Calcium Carbonate (extra gilder&apos;s whiting) White lead.. Extra heavy boiled linseed oil. Red Oil.... Lamp black in oil. Per Cent. 70.00 14.00 14.00 1.81 .19 100.00 The linseed oil must be specially prepared and have a specific heavy body to insure a satisfactory article. One of the principal reasons for reputtying jobs is the fact that putty is not given time to set before the sash are carted or handled. All wood sash should be allowed to stand for two weeks if glazed, so that the wood can absorb the oil and the putty can harden. &quot; &quot;230 Workmen&apos;s Compensation Law dren of the deceased under the age of eighteen years, but no surviving wife (or dependent husband), then for the support of each such child until of the age of eighteen years, fifteen per centum of the wages of the deceased, provided that the aggregate shall in no case ex- ceed sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of such wages. or 4. If the amount payable to surviving wife (or dependent husband) and to children under the age of eighteen years shall be less in the aggregate than sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the average wages of the deceased, then for the support of grandchildren brothers and sisters under the age of eighteen years, if dependent upon the deceased at the time of the accident, fif- teen per centum of such wages for the support of each such person until of the age of eighteen years; and for the support of each parent, or grandparent, of the deceased if dependent upon him at the time of the accident, fifteen per centum of such wages during such de- pendency. But in no case shall the aggregate amount payable under this subdivision exceed the difference be- tween sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of such wages, and the amount payable as hereinbefore provided to sur- viving wife (or dependent husband) or for the support of surviving child or children. Any excess of wages over one hundred dollars a month shall not be taken into account in computing compensation un- der this section. All questions of de- pendency shall be determined as of the time of the accident. Sec. 17. Aliens. Compensation under this chapter to aliens not residents (or about to become nonresidents) of the United States or Canada, shall be the same in amount as provided for resi- dents, except that the commission may, at its option, or, upon the application of the insurance carrier, shall commute all future installments of compensation to be paid to such aliens, by paying or caus- ing to be paid to them one-half of the commuted amount of such future install- ments of compensation as determined by the commission. Sec. 18. Notice of injury. Notice of an injury for which compensation is payable under this chapter shall be given within ten days after disability, and also to the commission and to the employer in case of the death of the employee resulting from such injury, within thirty uays after such death. Such notice may be given by any person claiming to be entitled to compensation, or by some one in his behalf. The notice shall be in writing, and contain the name and address of the employee, and state in ordinary language the time, place, nature and cause of the injury, and be signed by him or by a person on his behalf or, in case of death, by any one or more of his dependents, or by a person on their behalf. It shall be given to the commission by sending it by mail, by registered letter, addressed to the com- mission at its office. It shall be given to the employer by delivering it to him or sending it by mail, by registered let- ter, addressed to the employer at his or its last known place of residence; pro- vided that, if the employer be a part- nership then such notice may be so given to any one of the partners, and if the employer be a corporation, then such notice may be given to any agent or officer thereof upon whom legal process may be served, or any agent in charge of the business in the place where the injury occurred. The failure to give such notice, unless excused by the com- mission either on the ground that no- tice for some sufficient reason could not have been given, or on the ground that the state fund, insurance company, or employer, as the case may be, has not been prejudiced thereby, shall be a bar to any claim under this chapter. Sec. 19. Medical examination. An em- ployee injured claiming or entitled to compensation under this chapter shall, if requested by the commission, submit himself for medical examination at a time, and from time to time, at a place reasonably convenient for the employee, and as may be provided by the rules of the commission. If the employee or the insurance carrier request he shall be entitled to have a physician or physi- cians of his own selection to be paid by him present to participate in such examination. If an employee refuse to submit himself to examination, his right to prosecute any proceeding under this chapter shall be suspended, and no com- pensation shall be payable, for the period of such refusal. Sec. 20. Determination of claims for compensation. At any time after the expiration of the first fourteen days of disability on the part of an injured em- ployee, or at any time after his death, a claim for compensation may be pre- sented to the commission. The com- mission shall have full power and au- thority to determine all questions in re- lation to the payment of claims for com- pensation under the provisions of this cnapter.

For light roofs having a span of not over 50 feet, and not required to support any ceiling, the weight of the steel construction may be taken at 5 pounds per square foot; for greater spans, 1 pound per square foot should be added for each 10 feet increase in the span. SNOW AND WIND LOAD. Data in regard to snow and wind loads in connection with the design of roof trusses: When the slope of a roof is over 12 inches rise per foot of horizontal run, a snow and accidental load of 8 pounds per square foot is ample. When the slope is under 12 inches rise per foot of run, a snow and accidental load of 12 pounds per square foot should be used. The snow load acts vertically and therefore should be added to the dead load in designing roof trusses. The snow load may be neglected when a high wind pressure has been considered, as a great wind storm would very likely remove all the snow from the roof. The wind is considered as blowing in a horizontal direction, but the resulting pressure upon the roof as always taken normal, at right angles, to the slope. The wind pressure against a vertical plane depends on the velocity of the wind, and, as ascertained by the United States Signal Service at Mount Washington, N. H., is as follows: Velocity (Mi. per Hr.) 10. 20. 30. 40. 50. 60. 80 100. Pressure Lb. per Sq. Ft.) 0.4. 1.6. 3.6. 6.4. 10.0. 14.4. .25.6. 40.0 Pressure of Wind on Roofs (Unwin). .

The protection over skylights shall be of stout wire netting not over three-fourths inch mesh on stout timbers and properly secured. All such sheds and inclosures are to be subject to the inspection of the Department of Buildings. Should said adjoining owner, tenant or lessee refuse to grant permission to have said roofs and skylights so pro- tected, such refusal by said owner, tenant or lessee shall relieve the owner of the building in course of construction from any responsibility for damage done to persons or property on or within the premises affected. Should such inclosure or protection not be so erected, the Commissioner of Buildings having jurisdiction shall cause a notice to be served personally upon the owner, or his authorized agent, constructing or repairing such buildings, or the owner, tenants or lessee of adjoining premises, requiring such inclosure or protection, as provided in this section, specifying the manner in which same shall be erected; and if such inclosures or protections are not erected, strengthened or modified as provided in such notice within three days after the service thereof, the said Commissioner of Buildings having jurisdiction, shall have full power and authority to cause such inclosure to be erected on the fronts and roofs and the skylights protected, and all expenses connected with same may become a lien on the property in interest so inclosed and protected, and which lien may be created and enforced in the same manner as now provided for in section 156 of this code. Sec. 81. (Grain Elevators.) PART XV. Miscellaneous Buildings. Nothing in this code shall be so construed as to apply to or prevent the erection of what are known as grain elevators, as usually constructed, provided they are erected on tidewater, or adjacent to the river front in said city, in isolated localities, under such conditions as the Department of Buildings may pre- scribe, including location. Sec. 82. (Exhibition Buildings.) Buildings for fair and exhibition purposes, towers for observation purposes and structures for similar uses, whether temporary or permanent in character, shall be constructed in such manner and under such conditions as the Board of Buildings may prescribe. Sec. 83. (Smokehouses.) All smokehouses shall be of fireproof construction, with brick walls, iron doors and brick or metal roofs. An iron guard shall be placed over and three feet above the fire, and the hanging rails shall be of iron. The walls of all smoke- houses shall be built up at least three feet higher than the roof of the building in which they are located. Sec. 84. PART XVI. Heating Apparatus, Drying Rooms, Gas and Water Pipes. (Heating Furnaces and Boilers.) BRICK SET BOILERS.-A brick-set boiler shall not be placed on any wood or combustible floor or beams. PORTABLE BOILERS.-Wood or combustible floors and beams under and not less than three feet in front and one foot on the sides of all portable boilers shall be protected by a suitable brick foundation of not less than two courses of brick well laid in mortar on sheet iron; the said sheet iron shall extend at least twenty-four inches outside of the foundations at the sides and front. Bearing lines of bricks, laid on the flat, with air spaces between them, shall be placed on the foundation to support a cast-iron ash pan of suitable thickness, on which the base of the boiler shall be placed, and shall have a flange, turned up in the front &quot; &quot;82 Building Code BUILDINGS OVER 12 STORIES OR OVER 150 FEET HIGH.-When the height of a fireproof building exceeds twelve stories, or more than one hundred and fifty feet, the floor surfaces shall be of stone, cement, rock, asphalt, tiling or similar incombustible materials, or the sleepers and floors may be of wood treated by some process approved by the board of buildings to render the same fireproof. All outside window frames and sash shall be of metal, or of wood covered with metal, the inside window frames and sash, doors, trim and other interior finish may be of wood covered with metal, or of wood treated by some process approved by the board of buildings to render the same fireproof. All hall partitions or permanent partitions between rooms in fireproof build- ings shall be built of fireproof material and shall not be started on wood sills, nor on wooden floor boards, but be built upon the fireproof construction of the floor and extend to the fireproof beam filling above. The tops of all door and window openings in such partitions shall be at least twelve inches below the ceiling line. Sec. 106. (Fireproof Floors.) Fireproof floors shall be constructed with wrought iron or steel floor beams so arranged as to spacing and length of beams that the load to be supported by them, together with the weights of the materials used in the construction of the said floors shall not cause a greater deflection of the said beams than one-thirtieth of inch per foot of span under the total load, and they shall be tied together at intervals of not more than eight times the depth of the beam. • BRICK FLOOR ARCHES.-Between the wrought iron or steel floor beams shall be placed brick arches springing from the lower flange of the steel beams. Said brick arches shall be designed with a rise to safely carry the imposed load, but never less than one and one-quarter inches for each foot of span between the beams, and they shall have a thickness of not less than four inches for spans of five feet or less and eight inches for spans over five feet, of such thickness as may be required by the board of buildings. Said brick arches shall be composed of good, hard brick or hollow brick of ordinary dimensions laid to a line on the centres, properly and solidly bounded, each longitudinal line of brick breaking joints with the adjoining lines in the same ring and with the ring under it when more than a four-inch arch is used. The brick shall be well wet and the joints filled in solid with cement mortar. The arches shall be well grouted and properly keyed. TERRA COTTA ARCHES. Or the space between the beams may be filled in with hollow tile arches of hard-burnt clay or porous terra-cotta of uniform density and hardness of burn. The skew backs shall be of such form and section as to properly receive the thrust of said arch; and the said arches shall be of a depth and sectional area to carry the load to be imposed thereon, without straining the material beyond its safe working load, but said depth shall not be less than one and three-quarter inches for each foot of span, not including any portion of the depth of the tile projecting below the under side of the beams, a variable dis- tance being allowed of not over six inches in the span between the beams, if the soffits of the tile are straight; but if said arches are segmental, having a rise of not less than one and one-quarter inches for each foot of span, the depth of the tile shall not be less than six inches. The joints shall be solidly filled with cement mortar as required for common brick arches and the arch so constructed that the key block shall always fall in the central portion. The shells and webs of all end construction blocks shall abut, one against another. REINFORCED CONCRETE ARCHES.-Or the space between the beams may be filled with arches of Portland cement concrete, segmental in form, and which shall have a rise of not less than one and one-quarter inches for each foot of span between the beams. The concrete shall not be less than four inches in thickness at the crown of the arch and shall be mixed in the proportions required by section 18 of this code. These arches shall in all cases be reinforced and protected on the under side with corrugated or sheet steel, steel ribs, or metal in other forms weighing not less than one pound per square foot and having no openings larger than three inches square. FLOOR SLABS.-Or between the said beams may be placed solid or hollow burnt-clay, stone, brick or concrete slabs in flat or curved shapes, concrete or other may be used in composition, and any of said materials may be used in combination with wire cloth, expanded metal, wire strands, or wrought iron or steel bars; but in any such construction and as a precedent condition to the same being used, tests shall be made as herein provided by the manufacturer thereof under the direction &quot; &quot;Schedule of Charges 15 in addition to the Regular Supervision of the Architects. Separate Contracts.- -Should it be de- cided that the Owner&apos;s interest would be best conserved by purchasing the Ma- terials or Executing a Building Improve- ment under numerous Direct or Separate Contracts, instead of under one General Contract, then the Architects, in addi- tion to their Regular Services, shall as- sume the General Management of the Building Improvement and perform the detail work, usually perfomed by the General Contractor, for which additional services, they shall charge an Additional Commission of 5%. Additional Services.-The expense of any additional services, rendered by the Architects, through the NEGLIGENCE, DELINQUENCY OR INSOLVENCY of the Owners or any Contractors in their employ, or through any Arbitrations, law suits, etc., shall be borne by the Owner. Minor Services for Buildings such as lofts, factories, and warehouses, where the elements of design, detail and in- terior partitions, etc. are lessened, this condition should be met with propriety by the Architects through a concession of one-sixth reduction from the Archi- tects&apos; Regular Services. Special Services.-The before men- tioned Regular Services of the Archi- tects for which the minimum Commis- sion of 6% is charged, shall not include any buildings costing less than $10,000, nor any Alterations to existing Struc- tures, both of which shall be classed as and included under the head of special services, together with Monuments, Mau- soleums, Landscape Architecture, Dec- orations, Furniture, Fixtures, Rugs, Dra- peries, etc.. draperies designed by or purchased with the advice of, or in con- sultation with the Architects and are designated as Special Services, on all of which the minimum Commission shall be 12%.

The provisions of this section shall not apply to a tenement house hereafter erected running through from one street to another street, provided that the lot on which it is situated does not exceed one hundred feet in depth. Sec. 51. (Height.)-The height of no tenement house hereafter erected shall by more than one-half exceed the width of the widest street upon which it stands. Such height shall be the perpendicular distance measured in a straight line from the curb level to the underside of the roof beams; provided that if the cornice exceeds one-tenth of such height, the measurements shall be taken to the top of the cornice, and provided that if there are bulkhead, superstructures or pent houses exceeding ten feet in height or exceeding in aggregate area ten per centum of the area of the roof, the measurements shall be taken to the top of such bulkhead, superstructure or pent house; but this shall not apply to elevator inclosures not exceeding twenty-three feet in height, and used solely for ele- vator purposes, nor to open pergolas or similar open ornamental treatment of roof gardens or playgrounds. The measure- ments in all cases shall be taken through the centre of the facade of the house. In a fireproof tenement house hereafter erected in which one or more power passenger elevators are provided and operated, pent houses may be erected on the main roof, but such pent houses, including all bulkheads, shall not cover more than fifty per centum of the area of such roof. Such pent houses shall not be used or rented as apartments, but their use shall be limited solely to laundry and store- room purposes and to servants&apos; and janitor&apos;s quarters.

Such pent houses shall not be deemed as affecting the measurement of the height of the building, as described in the first part of this section, nor for the purposes of sections fifty-three, fifty-seven, fifty-eight and fifty-nine of this chapter. All such pent houses shall be entirely fireproof, with floors of brick, stone, cement, iron or other hard incombustible material, with windows, doors and trim of kalamein or hollow metal and all glass to be of good quality wire-glass. No tenement house shall be increased in height so that the building shall exceed by more than one-half the width of the widest street on which it stands. Sec. 52. (Yards.) -Behind every tenement house here- after erected there shall be a yard extending across the entire width of the lot, and except upon a corner lot, at every point open from the ground to the sky unobstructed, except that fire-escapes or uninclosed outside stairs may project not over four feet from the rear line of the house, and except that one open-slat fire-escape bridge or platform not exceeding four feet in width may extend across above the yard, from the roof of one tenement house to the roof of an adjoining or abutting building to furnish roof egress.

In none of the thirty-four plants in- vestigated has the true rate for amor- tization been determined, since none have been abandoned up to date. 34 show less than 5% depreciation. 29 show less than 42% depreciation. 17 show less than 4% depreciation. 16 show less than 32% depreciation. 4 show less than 3% depreciation. 1 (New York Herald) plant may or may not show less than 3 per cent. de- preciation. Are They Popular? A New York architect suggested to the owner of a large office building in Indianapolis, Ind., that he might save money by installing an electric plant and making his own electricity. The owner replied: &quot;Why should I try to make my electricity, when 97 per cent. of the big buildings in New York are buying their electricity from the street, and have found that inde- pendent electric plants are not profit- able?&quot; The New York Times List. On October 12th, 1913, the New York Times published a Tax List giving a list of large buildings on Manhattan Island. Personal inspection was made of the premses of all the occupied buildings, except residences, to find out whether they had power plants operating on the premises or not. 63 Per Cent. Make Electricity. It was found that 78 per cent. of the value of these buildings, and 63 per cent. of their number, were supplied by independent electric plants. 100 per cent. of the railroad stations have power plants. 96 per cent. of the hotels have power plants. 72 per cent. of the office buildings and stores have power plants. 57 per cent. of the club houses have power plants. 57 per cent. of the banks have power plants. 37 per cent. of the apartments have power plants. Not one of the theatres have power plants. An Interesting Conclusion. It will be noted that those types of buildings which have the longest hours of active service throughout the year show the greatest popularity of inde- pendent electric plants. Conversely, those buildings which have a short, or intermittent service show the greatest popularity of the outside electric cur- rent. The table given above shows the pro- portion of the number of buildings which are independently supplied, while the chart following shows graphically the values of buildings supplied each way. L. K.

(Certain Alterations and Buildings Moved from One Lot to Another.)-If any tenement house existing on April eleventh, nineteen hundred and one, shall be so altered as to increase the number of rooms therein by thirty-three and one-third per centum or more, or if such building is increased in height so that the said building is more than four stories or parts of stories above the curb level, and also the number of rooms is increased therein, the entire stair halls, entrance halls and other public halls of the whole building shall be made to conform to the requirements of sections eighteen to twenty-three, inclusive, of this chapter. If any tenement house erected prior to April tenth, nineteen hundred and one, be hereafter moved from one lot to another, it shall thereupon become subject to all the requirements of this chapter affecting tenement houses hereafter erected.

Cheaper grades of coal can be used and the saving in cost per ton much more than offsets any increased consumption. Small sizes of anthracite coal can be burned on the Grieve Grate in sufficient quantity to duplicate the results obtained with bituminous coal and the smoke trouble is eliminated. Refuse can be burned advantageously in mixture with coal. Owing to its design there is no loss of unburned coal into the ash- pit—no continuous replacement charge. It is simple and quick in operation. COXE TRAVELING GRATE The Automatic Anthracite Stoker Burns the smallest sizes culm which cannot be burned in any other way and gives you high ratings.

Such estimate shall be reduced to writing on printed forms furnished by the Department of Buildings, stating the material, size, distance apart and span of beams and girders, posts or columns to support floors, and its correctness shall be sworn to by the person making the same, and it shall thereupon be filed in the office of the De- partment of Buildings. But if the Commissioner of Buildings shall have cause to doubt the correctness of such estimate, they are empowered to revise and correct the same, and for the purpose of such revision the officers and employees of the Depart- ment of Buildings may enter any building and remove so much of any floor or other portion thereof as may be required to make necessary measurements and examination. When the correct estimate of the weight that the floors in any such buildings will safely sustain has been ascertained, as herein provided, the Department of Buildings shall approve the same, and thereupon the owner or occupant of said building, or of any portion thereof, shall post a copy of such approced estimate in a conspicuous place on each story, or varying parts of each story, of the building to which it relates. NEW BUILDINGS.-Before any building hereafter erected is occupied and used, in whole or in part, of any of the purposes aforesaid, and before any build- ing, erected prior to the passage of this code, but not at such time occupied for any of the aforesaid purposes, is occupied or used, in whole or in part, for any of said purposes, the weight that each floor will safely sustain upon each super- ficial foot thereof, shall be ascertained and posted in a conspicuous place on each story or varying parts of each story of the building to which it relates. No person shall place or cause or permit to be placed, on any floor of any building any greater load than the safe load thereof, as correctly estimated and ascer- tained as herein provided. Any expense necessarily incurred in removing any floor or other portion of any building for the purpose of making any examination herein provided for shall be paid by the Comptroller of the City of New York, upon the requisition of the Board of Buildings, out of the fund paid over to said board under the provisions of section one hundred and fifty-eight of this code. Such expenses shall be a charge against the person or persons by whom or on whose behalf said estimate was made, provided such examination proves the floors of insufficient strength to carry with safety the loads found upon them when such examination was made; and shall be collected in an action to be brought by the Corporation Counsel against said person or persons, and the sum so collected shall be paid over to the said Comptroller to be deposited in said fund in reim- bursement of the amount paid as aforesaid. When the architect of record for any building has filed with his application to build the data required to deter- mine the strength of floors, on one of the blank forms provided for that purpose, such examination shall not be required, provided that the purposes and uses of the building have not been changed. Sec. 133. (Strength of Temporary Supports.) DURING CONSTRUCTION. Every temporary support placed under any structure, wall girder or beams, during the erection, finishing, alteration or repair- ing of any building or structure or any part thereof, shall be of sufficient strength to safely carry the load to be placed thereon.

Such tests shall be made by constructing within in- closure walls a platform consisting of four rolled steel beams, ten inches deep, weighing each twenty-five pounds per lineal foot, and placed four feet between the centres, and connected by transverse tie-rods, and with a clear span of four- teen feet for the two interior beams and with the two outer beams supported on the side walls throughout their length and with both a filling between the said beams, and a fireproof protection of the exposed parts of the beams of the system to be tested, constructed as in actual practice, with the quality of material ordi- narily used in that system and the ceiling plastered below, as in a finished job; such filling; and subjecting the platform so constructed to the continuous heat of one hundred and fifty pounds per square foot of its area and all carried by such filling; and subjecting the platform so constructed to the continuous heat of a wood fire below, averaging not less than seventeen hundred degrees Fahrenheit for not less than four hours, during which time the platform shall have remained in such condition that no flame will have passed through the platform or any part of the same, and that no part of the load shall have fallen through, and that the beams shall have been protected from the heat to the extent that after applying to the under side of the platform at the end of the heat test a stream of water directed against the bottom of the platform and discharge through a one and one- eighth inch nozzle under sixty pounds pressure for five minutes, and after flooding the top of the platform with water under low pressure, and then again applying the stream of water through the nozzle under the sixty pounds pressure to the bottom of the platform for five minutes, and after a total load of six hundred pounds per square foot uniformly distributed over the middle bay shall have been applied and removed, after the platform shall have cooled, the maximum deflection of the interior beams shall not exceed two and one-half inches. The board of buildings may from time to time prescribe additional or different tests than the foregoing for systems of filling between iron or steel floor beams, and the protection of the exposed parts of the beams. Any system failing to meet the requirements of the test of heat, water and weight, as herein prescribed, shall be prohibited from use in any building hereafter erected. Duly authenticated records of the tests heretofore made of any system of fireproof floor filling and protection of the exposed parts of the beams may be presented to the board of buildings, and if the same be satisfactory to said board, it shall be accepted as conclusive. No filling of any kind which may be injured by frost shall be placed between said floor beams during freezing weather, and if the same is so placed during any winter month, it shall be temporarily covered with suitable material for protection from being frozen. CINDER CONCRETE FILLING.-On top of any arch, lintel or other device, which does not extend to and form a horizontal line with the top of the said floor beams, cinder, concrete or other suitable fireproof material shall be placed to solidly fill up the space to a level with the top of the said floor beams, and shall be carried to the under side of the wood floor boards in case such be used. STRENGTH AND SAFETY.-Temporary centering when used in placing fire- proof systems between floor beams, shall not be removed within twenty-four hours or until such time as the mortar or material has set. All fireproof floor systems shall be of sufficient strength to safely carry the load to be imposed thereon without straining the material in any case beyond its safe working load. FIREPROOFING EXPOSED BEAM FLANGES.-The bottom flanges of all wrought iron or rolled steel floor and flat roof beams, and all exposed portions of such beams, below the abutments of the floor arches shall be entirely incased with hard burnt clay, porous terra-cotta or other fireproof material allowed to be used for the filling between the beams under the provisions of this section, such incasing material to be properly secured to the beams. FIREPROOFING GIRDERS.-The exposed sides and bottom plates or flanges of wrought iron or rolled steel girders supporting iron or steel floor beams, or supporting floor arches or floors, shall be entirely incased in the same manner. PIPE OPENINGS IN FLOORS.-Openings through fireproof floors for pipes, conduits and similar purposes shall be shown on the plans. After the floors are constructed no opening greater than eight inches square shall be cut through said floors unless properly boxed or framed around with iron. And such openings shall be filled in with fireproof material after the pipes or conduits are in place. Sec. 107. (Incasing Interior Columns.)

Protection of Ends of Wood- en Beams.-The ends of all floor, ceil- ing or roof beams, entering a party or fire wall from opposite sides shall be separated by at least 8 inches of solid masonry; such separation may be ob- tained by corbeling the wall, or stagger- ing the beams; or the beams may be supported by steel wall hangers; but no wall shall be corbeled more than 2 inches for this purpose. The ends of all wood- en beams which enter walls, shall be cut to a bevel to make them self-releasing. Sec. 11. Protection of Wall Openings. -No opening in an interior masonry wall shall exceed 8 feet by 10 feet. If the opening be in a party or fire wall, it shall a standard automatic fire door on each side of the wall. If an open- ing in a fire wall is made to serve as an emergency exit, it shall not exceed 48 square feet in area, and a self-clos- ing fire door shall be submitted for one of the automatic fire doors. The total openings in a fire wall shall not exceed 25 per cent in linear length of the wall. Every building within the fire limits, except churches, dwellings, tenement houses, dormitories and lodging houses, shall have standard fire doors, shutters or wired glass in incombustible frames and sash on every exterior opening above the first story, except when front- ing on a street not less than 35 feet wide, or where no other building is within 35 feet of such opening. The wall of a building in the same plane as that in which the opening is situated, shall not be considered as coming within the intent of this rule. All openings in the side and rear walls of the first story, ex- cept show windows, shall be protected as prescribed in this section when within 35 feet of another building. All windows more than 75 feet above the curb shall have incombustible frames and sash glazed with wired glass. Occupants of buildings shall close all exterior and interior fire doors, shutters and windows at the close of business each day. Sec. 12. Stairway and Elevator Shafts. In all buildings hereafter erected, ex- cept private dwellings, which are used above the first floor for business pur- poses or for public assemblage, or for any purpose whatever if over three stories high, the stair shafts shall be separated and continuously enclosed by incombustible partitions. Elevator shafts in all buildings hereafter erected shall be enclosed in the same manner. The partitions shall be constructed of brick or other fire-resistive material approved by the Chief of Fire Depart- ment or other designated official, and all mortar used in the construction shall be cement mortar. No such hollow partition shall be less than 6 inches thick, no brick partition less than 8 inches thick and no other solid partition less than 4 inches thick. Except as herein stated, the stair, ele- vator or hoistway shafts in all existing buildings over two stories high, of the class described in this section, shall be separately enclosed by incombustible partitions as above specified; or the shafts may be enclosed by approved hol- low or solid partition blocks not less than 3 inches thick, set in portland ce- ment mortar; or by 4-inch stud parti- tions, covered on each side with not less than 34 inch of portland cement plaster on metal lath; or by inch solid metal lath and portland cement plaster parti- tions. The metal framework of such partitions shall be securely fastened to both floor and ceiling. All lath used for such partitions shall be of galvanized steel weighing not less than 54 ounces per square yard. Wire lath shall not be less than No. 20 gage, and sheet metal lath not less than No. 24 gage. All such partitions erected in existing buildings shall be fire-stopped with in- combustible material the full depth of the floor beams at each floor level. All door openings in stair and eleva- tor enclosures shall be protected by fire doors mounted with wrought iron or steel hardware, and shall be securely at- tached to the wall or partition, or to substantial incombustible frames anchor- ed thereto. If glass panels be used in such doors, they shall be of wired glass not exceeding 720 square inches in area. Interior shaft windows shall not be per- mitted. Doors opening into stairway shafts shall swing in the direction of exit travel, shall be self-closing, and shall be at least 36 inches wide. The enclosure walls for all elevator shafts shall extend at least 3 feet above the roof, and at least three-fourths of the area shall be covered with a skylight constructed as specified in Section 13. If in the opinion of the Chief of Fire Department or other designated official, it is necessary to preserve an open ele- vator or hoistway in an existing build- ing, the floor openings through which it passes shall be equipped with auto- matically closing trap doors not less than 1½ inches thick, made of two &quot; &quot;286 Legal Relations It was found as a fact that the 5 per cent, was apportioned, 3½ per cent. to the plans and 12 per cent. to the superintendence. The building was but one-half constructed-the contract price being $330,000 for the whole. How much of a lien has he, if any? It was held in the first place that an architect who merely prepares plans and specifications, has no lien for those services, since this work cannot be construed to be on the buildings. The statute contemplates active par- ticipation in the construction only. But the Lien Law is not limited merely to ser- vices that are unskilled and manual but includes the skilled labor of supervision, since the latter is just as essential as that of the laborer who carries mortar. Therefore, the architect has a lien at least for his services as superintendent. Whether the architect who both makes the plans and supervises, is entitled to a lien for both, because of the &amp;quot;concurrence of the two&amp;quot; is a doubtful question. The language of the case cited, is as follows: &amp;quot;This rule, as applied here, limited the lien to the actual superintendence of the part constructed.&amp;quot; On the other hand, the court in Stryker v. Cassidy, 76 N. Y. 50, speaks as follows: &amp;quot;An architect who makes the plans and supervises the erection of a building, is within the words and reason of the Lien Law.&amp;quot; My conclusion is, first, that the architect has no lien for plans alone. Second, that he absolutely has a lien for supervision. Third, that whether he has a lien planning and supervision when these services concur, is doubtful, though a strong case can be put up in favor of it. Practically, an architect can provide in his agreement that a large part of his 5 per cent. shall be for supervision, and so give himself clear ground for a lien for much of his fee at least. I gather from the decision in the case of Rinn v. Electric Power Co. above that the architect got judgment for one-half the value of making the plans, since the building was but half built, and for his supervision of the half-completed power house, and all ex- penses in and about the construction of the building. This argues in favor of a lien for plans as well as supervision when they concur, but is not conclusive in the face of the above-quoted language. It might be well to note that in the case of public improvements, the lien can attach only to the Public&apos;s money applicable to such purposes. This paper, gentlemen, is a rather jumbled statement of disconnected points of Law that affect your profession. More time would have resulted in greater clarity of expression. However, if any one idea suggested, should be the means of saving you the discomfort of a misunderstanding with your client or his con- tractor, I shall feel compensated. Once more, I wish to thank you for the privi- lege of appearing before you. THADDEUS W. VENESS, 32 Liberty Street, New York City. &quot; &quot;Tenement House Law 165 Sec. 8.

PROTECTION FROM FIRE. Sec. 14. (Fireproof Tenement, When Required.)—Every tenement house hereafter erected exceeding six stories or parts of stories in height above the curb level, shall be a fireproof tenement house, nor shall any tenement house be altered so as to exceed such height without being made a fireproof tene- ment house. A cellar the ceiling of which does not extend more than two feet above the curb level is not a story within the meaning of this section. Where, however, a tenement house hereafter erected is located on a street of which the grade is more than four feet in one hundred feet, a cellar or basement, the ceiling of which does not extend more than six inches above the highest point of the curb level, is not to be deemed a story within the meaning of this section, provided, however, that no part of such cellar or basement is occupied or arranged to be occupied for living purposes except by the janitor of such building and his family, and provided also that such cellar or basement is the lowest story of such building. Sec. 15. (Means of Egress.)-Every tenement house here- after erected, both fireproof and non-fireproof, exceeding one story in height shall have at least two independent ways of egress which shall extend from the ground floor to the roof, and shall be located remote from each other, and shall be separated from each other by walls. One of such ways of egress shall be a flight of stairs constructed and arranged as provided in sections eighteen to twenty-two inclusive of this chapter. The other way of egress shall be directly accessible at each story to each apartment without having to pass through the first way of egress. Such other way of egress may be any one of the following, as the owner may elect: 1. A system of outside fire-escapes constructed and ar- ranged as provided in Section 16 of this chapter. 2. An additional flight of stairs, either inside or outside, constructed and arranged as provided in Sections 18 to 22 in- clusive of this chapter. 3. A fire-tower constructed and arranged as provided in Section 22a of this chapter. Sec. 16. (Fire Escapes.)—1. All fire-escapes hereafter erected upon tenement houses shall be located, arranged and constructed as follows: Such fire-escapes shall open directly from at least one room or private hall in each apartment at each story above the ground floor, other than a bathroom or water-closet com- partment, and shall not include the window of a stair hall, and such room or private hall shall be an integral part of said apartment and accessible to every room thereof without pass- ing through a public hall. Access to fire-escapes shall not be obstructed in any way. No fire-escape shall be placed in a court except where required by law for apartments not having New Tenements Fireproof over 6 stories.

In such last named tenement houses which do not occupy more than sixty-five per centum of the the lot, in the case of an interior lot, where an inner court for its entire length immediately adjoins an existing inner court of equal or greater size in an adjoining building or adjoins such a court in an adjoining building actually in course of construction at the same time, the width of such inner court measured from the lot line to the opposite wall of the building shall not be less than four feet in any part, and not less than eight feet from wall to wall, and its other horizontal dimen- sion shall be not less than twelve and one-half feet. 2. Where an inner court is not situated upon the lot line, but is inclosed on all four sides, the least horizontal dimension of the said court for tenement houses sixty feet in height, shall not be less than twenty-four feet; and for every twelve feet of increase or fraction thereof in the height of the said building, the said court shall be increased one foot in each horizontal dimension, throughout the entire height of said court; and for every twelve feet of decrease in the height of the said building below sixty feet, the horizontal dimensions of the said court may be decreased one foot in each direction. Except that in tenement houses hereafter erected not exceeding four stories and cellar in height and which are not occupied or arranged to be occupied by more than eight families in all, or by more than two families on any floor, and in which also each apartment extends through from the street to the yard, and which also do not occupy more than seventy-two per centum of the lot in the case of an interior lot, the least horizontal dimension of an inner court not situated on the lot line, but inclosed on all four sides, shall not be less than fourteen feet. Except also that in such tenement houses which do not exceed three stories and cellar in height and which also are not occupied, or arranged to be occupied, by more than six families in all, or by more than two families on any floor, and which do not occupy more than sixty-five per centum of the lot, in the case of an interior lot, the width of such inner court shall not be less than eight feet in any part, and its other horizontal dimension shall not be less than twelve and one-half feet. In inner courts which are not less than ten feet wide in any part, offsets and recesses will be permitted, but where the depth of such offset or recess is less than the minimum width prescribed, then the width of said offset or recess may be equal to but not less than its depth, provided that such width is never less than four feet in the clear. And no window except windows of water-closet compartments, bath-rooms or halls shall open upon any offset or recess less than six feet in width. 3. Every inner court shall be provided with one or more horizontal intakes at the bottom. Such intakes shall always communicate directly with the street or yard, and shall con- sist of a passageway not less than three feet wide and seven feet high which shall be left open, or if not open there shall always be provided in said passageway open grilles or tran- soms of a size not less than five square feet each, and such open grilles or transoms shall never be covered over by glass or in any other way. There shall be at least two such grilles or transoms in each such passageway, one at the inner court and the other at the street or yard, as the case may be. Sec. 59. (Outer and Inner Courts.)-Nothing contained in the foregoing sections concerning outer and inner courts shall be construed as preventing the cutting off of the corners of said courts, provided that the running length of the wall at 65% interior lot, not over 3 stories, not over 6 families.

But no ex- isting fire-escape shall be deemed suffi- cient unless the following conditions are complied with: (1) All parts of it shall be of iron, cement or stone. (2) The fire-escape shall consist of outside palconies which shall be properly connected with each other by adequate stairs or stationary ladders, with open- ings not less than twenty-four by twenty- eight inches. (3) All fire-escapes shall have proper drop ladders or stairways from the low- est balcony of sufficient length to reach a safe landing place beneath. (4) All fire-escapes not on the street shall have a safe and adequate means of egress from the yard or court to the street or alley or to the adjoining prem- ises. (5) Prompt anl ready access shall be had to all fire-escapes, which shall not be obstructed by bath-tubs, water- closets, sinks or other fixtures, or in any other way. All fire-escapes that are already erect- ed which do not conform to the require- ments of this section may be altered by the owner to make them so conform in lieu of providing new fire-escapes, but no existing fire-escape shall be extended or have its location changed except with the written approval of the superintend- ent of buildings. All fire-escapes here- after erected on any multiple-dwelling shall be located and constructed as pre- scribed in section fifty-two of this act. Sec. 128. Additional means of egress. Whenever any multiple-dwelling is not provided with sufficient means of egress in case of fire, the superintendent of buildings shall order such additional means of egress as may be necessary. Sec. 129. Roof egress; scuttles, bulk- heads, ladders and stairs. Every flat- roofed multiple-dwelling exceeding one story in height erected prior to the pas- sage of this act shall have in the roof a bulkhead or a scuttle which shall be not less than two feet by three feet in size. All such bulkheads and scuttles shall be fireproof or covered on the out- side with metal and shall be provided with stairs or stationary ladders leading thereto and easily accessible to all occu- pants of the building. No scuttle or bulkhead shall be located in a room, but shall be located in the ceiling of the pub- lic hall on the top floor, and access through the same to the roof shall be direct and uninterrupted. When deemed necessary by the superintendent of build- ings scuttles shall be hinged so as to readily open. Every bulkhead in such multiple-dwelling snall have stairs with a guide or hand-rail leading to the roof, and such stairs shall be kept free from incumbrance at all times. No scuttle and no bulkhead door shall at any time be locked with a key, but either may be fastened on the inside by movable bolts or hooks.

In this article will be found the legal requirements, penalties for violations of the law, procedure, et cetera. Sec. 140. Permit to commence build- ing. Before the construction or altera- tion of a dwelling, or the alteration or conversion of a building for use as a dwelling, is commenced, and before the construction or alteration of any build- ing or structure on the same lot with a dwelling, the owner, or his agent or architect, shall submit to the health offi- cer a detailed statement in writing, veri- fied by the affidavit of the person making the same, of the specifications for such dwelling or building, upon blanks or forms to be furnished by such health officer, and also full and complete copies of the plans of such work. With such statement there shall be submitted a plat of the lot showing the dimensions of the same, the location of the proposed building and all otner buildings on the lot. Such statement shall give in full the name and residence, by street and number, of the owner or owners of such dwelling or building and the purposes for which such dwelling or building will be used. If such construction, alteration or conversion is proposed to be made by any other person than the owner of the land in fee, such statement shall con- tain the full name and residence by street and number, not only of the owner of the land, but of every person interested in such dwelling, either as owner, lessee or in any representative capacity. Said affidavit shall allege that said specifica- tions and plans are true and contain a correct description of such dwelling, building, structure, lot and proposed work. The statements and affidavits herein provided for may be made by the owner, or the person who proposes to make the construction, alteration or conversion, or by his agent or architect. No person, however, shall be recognized as the agent of the owner unless he shall file with the said health officer a written instrument, signed by such own- er, designating him as such agent. Any false swearing in a material point in any such affidavit shall be deemed perjury. Such specifications, plans and statements shall be filed in the said health depart- ment and shall be deemed public records, but no such specifications, plans or state- ments shall be removed from said health &quot; &quot;Reinforced Concrete 131 per square inch on the concrete within the hoops or spirals nor 8,700 pounds per square inch on the vertical reinforcement. 29. Axial compression in structural steel columns thoroughly encased in con- crete having a minimum thickness of four inches and reinforced with not less than one per cent. of hoops or spirals spaced not more than twelve inches apart, may be taken at 16,000 pounds per square inch on the net section of the struc- tural steel, no allowance being made for the concrete casing. The hoops or spirals of the concrete casing shall be placed not nearer than one inch from the structural steel or the outer surface of the concrete. The ratio of length to least radius of gyration of the structural steel section shall not exceed one hundred and twenty. 30. In reinforced concrete columns the compression on the concrete may be increased twenty per cent. when the fine and coarse aggregate are carefully selected and the proportion of cement to total aggregate is increased to one part of cement to not more than four and one-half parts of aggregate, fine and coarse, either in the proportion of one part of cement, one and one-half parts of sand and three parts of stone or gravel, or in such proportion as will secure the maxi- mum density. 31. The vertical steel bars in reinforced concrete columns shall bear squarely on steel plates or castings bedded on top of the footing. 32. Bending stresses due to eccentric loads shall be provided for by increas- ing the section of concrete or steel until the maximum stress shall not exceed the allowable working stress. 33. Whenever it is necessary to splice bars, the connections between them shall be of sufficient strength to carry the stress. 34. In columns, the splicing of longitudinals, having an area less than one and one-fourth square inches, may be done by lapping, the lapped bars to be wired securely to each other. Longitudinals having areas in excess of one and one-fourth square inches shall be spliced by cutting the bars squarely one over the other and tying the same securely together by some mechanical means that will not utilize the adhesive strength of the concrete. All such splices shall be made above floor levels, but not more than twelve inches above the same. 35. In columns the ratio of length to least side of diameter shall not exceed fifteen, but in no case shall the least side or diameter be less than twelve inches. 36. The concrete members of floor constructions in which hollow tiles, con- crete blocks or other acceptable fillers are used, in combination with reinforced concrete, shall be designed in accordance with these regulations, except that the slab portion cast on top of the fillers may have a minimum thickness of two and one-half inches, provided the fillers do not exceed sixty per cent. of the con- struction. 37. Exterior and interior bearing and enclosure walls of reinforced concrete, supporting floor and roof loads shall be securely anchored at all floors, and of such thickness that the compressive stress shall not exceed 250 pounds per square inch, but in no case less than eight inches. The thickness shall not be less than one-twentieth of the unsupported height. Steel reinforcement shall be placed near both faces of the wall, running both horizontally and vertically and weighing not less than one-half pound per square foot of wall. 38. Footings for walls and columns may be constructed of reinforced con- crete provided the working stresses for concrete and steel are not exceeded and the steel is protected by at least four inches of concrete. 39. The steel reinforcement in columns and girders shall be protected by a minimum of two inches of concrete; in beams and walls by a minimum of one and one-half inches; and in floor slabs by a minimum of one inch of concrete. 40. The contractor may be required to make load tests on any portion of a reinforced concrete structure within a reasonable time after erection. The tests shall be made under the direction of the Superintendent of Buildings, and shall show that the construction will sustain safely a load twice the live load for which it was designed. 41. These regulations do not apply to any construction for which provision is otherwise made in the Building Code. &quot; &quot;ii 米米 ​MAUSOLEUM DOORS. CASS GILBERT..

If a party-wall balcony located in an outer court not more than fifteen feet in length measured from the outer end of such court to the innermost point thereof, and not less than five feet in width from wall to wall at any point between such fire-escape and the outer end of said court, and provided also that there are no doors or openings in the walls between the two buildings other than windows in fireproof air-shafts. 6. If the fire-escapes are located on tenement houses that are less than four stories in height and which also do not contain accommodations for more than four families in all, and they are such iron, steel or wire-cable fire-escapes as have been approved by the department charged with the enforcement of chapter, under authority of law. But, however, no fire-escape shall be deemed sufficient un- less the following conditions are complied with: a. All parts of it shall be of iron or stone. b. Every apartment above the ground floor in each tene- ment house shall have a fire-escape directly accessible to it without passing through a public hall. C. All balconies shall be properly connected with each other by adequate stairs or stationary ladders, with openings not less than twenty-one by twenty-eight inches, except in the case of a party-wall balcony as prescribed in groups four and five of this subdivision. d.

Sec. 12. Compensation not allowed for first two weeks. No compensation shall be allowed for the first fourteen days of disability, except the benefits provided for in section thirteen of this chapter. Sec. 13. Treatment and care of in- jured employees. The employer shall promptly provide for an injured em- ployee such medical, surgical or other attendance or treatment, nurse and hos- pital service, medicines, crutches and apparatus as may be required or be requested by the employee, during sixty days after the injury. If the employer fail to provide the same, the injured employee may do so at the expense of the employer. The employee shall not be entitled to recover any amount ex- pended by him for such treatment or services unless he shall have requested the employer to furnish the same and the employer shall have refused or neg- lected to do so. All fees and other charges for such treatment and serv- ices shall be subject to regulation by the commission as provided in section twen- ty-four of this chapter, and shall be limited to such charges as prevail in the same community for similar treat- ment of injured persons of a like stand- ard of living. Sec. 14. Weekly wages basis of com- pensation. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the average weekly wages of the injured employee at the time of the injury shall be taken as the basis upon which to compute compen- sation or death benefits, and shall be determined as follows: 1. If the injured employee shall have worked in the employment in which he was working at the time of the accident, whether for the same em- ployer or not, during substantially the whole of the year immediately preced- ing his injury, his average annual earn- ings shall consist of three hundred times the average daily wage or salary which he shall have earned in such employ- ment during the days when so em- ployed; 2. If the injured employee shall not have worked in such employment dur- ing substantially the whole of such year, his average annual earnings shall con- sist of three hundred times the aver- age daily wage or salary which an em- ployee of the same class working sub- stantially the whole of such immediately preceding year in the same or in a sim- ilar employment in the same or a neigh- boring place shall have earned in such employment during the days when so employed; 3. If either of the foregoing methods of arriving at the annual average earn- ings of an injured employee cannot rea- sonably and fairly be applied, such an- nual earnings shall be such sum as, having regard to the previous earnings of the injured employee and of other employees of the same or most similar class, working in the same or most sim- ilar employment in the same or neigh- boring locality, shall reasonably repre- sent the annual earning capacity of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the accident; 4. The average weekly wages of an employee shall be one-fifty-second part of his average annual earnings; 5. If it be established that the in- jured employee was a minor when in- jured, and that under normal conditions his wages would be expected to increase, the fact may be considered in arriving at his average weekly wages. Sec. 15. Schedule in case of disability. The following schedule of compensation is hereby established: 1. Total permanent disability. In case of total disability adjudged to be per- manent sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the average weekly wages shall be paid to the employee during the continuance of such total disability. Loss of both hands, or both arms, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or of any two thereof shall, in the ab- sence of conclusive proof to the con- trary, constitute permanent total dis- ability. In all other cases permanent total disability shall be determined in accordance with the facts. 2. Temporary total disability. In case of temporary total disability, sixty- six and two-thirds per centum of the average weekly wages shall be paid to the employee during the continuance thereof, but not in excess of three thou- sand five hundred dollars, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 3. Permanent partial disability. In case of disability partial in character but permanent in quality the compensation shall be sixty-six and two-thirds per centum of the average weekly wages and shall be paid to the employee for the period named in the schedule as follows: Thumb. For the loss of a thumb, sixty weeks. First finger. For the loss of a first &quot; &quot;Legal Relations 281 tions; that the terms of the engagement govern the specifications, the specifica- tions, the drawings in turn, and the large scale drawings the small scale. It must be noted that the specifications and drawings are not part of the contract unless they are referred to in it, in such a manner that they can be identified definitely. The following statement deals with qualities of the agreement between the architect, client and contractor, that are more or less peculiar to building under- takings, as suggested in the introduction. The contract must conform absolutely to the Building Law-even if the plans should safely get by the inspection of the Superintendent of Buildings or whoever officially O. K.&apos;s such plans for the municipality, they offer a source of liability to the parties to the contract, if in reality the plans are contrary to the Law. Even if the agreement says nothing about conformity with the Building Code, and even omits some detail required by statute, e. g., fire-escapes of a certain type and di- mensions, the contractor must include these details as it is at least an implied term of the agreement that the building be in strict conformity with the Law. If the parties begin an undertaking that does not satisfy the Building Code, such agree- ment is absolutely void, and gives rise to no right or liability on the part of either party. A simple case* that arose in Buffalo exemplifies this. The contract was for the construction of a three-story brick store building, the walls of the first story being specified to be twelve inches thick. The local building Code provided for a minimum thickness of this wall of sixteen inches-so that because of this the plans failed to get the approval of the Superintendent of Buildings. Thereupon the owner changed his plans to provide for a wooden building, since they did not re- quire such a great thickness of wall. The disgruntled brick contractor sued on the first contract, claiming that the owner should at least have increased the thick- ness of the walls to sixteen inches. Because of this failure he claimed damages. But it was held, that since the contract was void as being in violation of the Build- ing Code, no one had any rights under it. This principle holds true also in the case of a contract made before the passage of some building law, to which it does not conform. If the building has not been built, the parties cannot recover on the contract as a valid agreement, since the statute avoids it. The parties should simply conform to the new law. Other principles of Law having special applicability to building contracts are those relating to penalties and liquidated damages-fifty dollars per day as liqui- dated damages, e. g., for failure to complete the contract by a day certain. The distinction between a penalty, and liquidated damages is hard to find even by ref- erence to opinions, although it must be taken to be fairly well settled by the present. To begin with, a penalty is literally a punishment. But the policy of the courts is absolutely opposed to any agreed punishment, unless the penalty fits the old Mosaic law exactly, of, &amp;quot;an eye for an eye.&amp;quot; Therefore, if the penalty agreed upon is more than the damage suffered by the party to whom the penalty is to be paid, the penalty is cut down to that amount. So that the parties can never be sure that the penalty agreed upon will be the amount paid over. The courts will only compel a payment, equivalent to the actual proved damage. If the sum agreed to be paid, however, be liquidated damages, then it is the amount settled on by the courts to be paid over, and is not reduced, unless patently unreasonable in amount. This gives rise to the very practical question-how be assured that the for- feiture will not be construed as a penalty, for the mere fact that you label your sum to be paid per day as &amp;quot;liquidated damages,&amp;quot; is far from conclusive in the courts. It may be said by way of warning, that if in justice and equity the owner is not entitled to any forfeiture, it is very hard to convince the court that the sum agreed upon represents liquidated damages. But to come to the actual law on this question, it has been held, first, that if the sum per day is called a &amp;quot;forfeiture&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;penalty&amp;quot; in the contract, the court is very liable to so hold it, and therefore cut it down. Therefore, call the forfeiture, &amp;quot;liquidated damages&amp;quot; to avoid this possibility. Second, the real intent of the parties is material, and this is ascertained from looking at all the facts and circumstances of the case. Third, if the damage to the owner by failure to have the building completed on time is hard to ascertain, and if the facts as to the amount of such damages are peculiarly within the knowledge of the two contracting parties, so that they can better decide their damages than any judge or jury, the sum payable will be interpreted to be liquidated damages. Vice versa, if the damage is easily ascertained, or merely nominal, and the sum per day set is plainly extravagant, the courts are liable to treat it as a penalty, and therefore cut it down to the damage actually suffered by the delay. Let me cite the case of Ward v. Hudson River Building Co., 125 N. Y. 230. The agreement was to build several dwellings. The contract provided for a for- *Burger v. Koelsch, 77 Hun., 44. &quot; &quot;Housing Law 155 Sec. 109. Janitor or housekeeper. In any multiple-dwelling in which the own- er thereof does not reside, there shall be a janitor, housekeeper or other re- sponsible person who shall reside in said house and have charge of the same, if the health officer shall so require. Sec. 110. Overcrowding. If any room in a dwelling is overcrowded, the health officer may order the number of persons sleeping or living in said room to be so reduced that there shall not be less than six hundred cubic feet of air to each adult, and four hundred cubic feet of air to each child under twelve years of age occupying such room. Sec. 111. Lodgers prohibited. No multiple-dwelling nor any part thereof shall be used for the letting of lodgings without the consent in writing of the health officer. Except in multiple-dwell- ings of class B, no person not a member of the family shall be taken to live with- in any apartment, group or suite of rooms without such consent. It shall be the duty of the owner of all mul- tiple - dwellings to see that the pro- visions of this section are at all times complied with, and a failure to so com- ply on the part of any tenant, after due and proper notice from said owner, shall be deemed sufficient cause for the sum- mary eviction of such tenant and the cancellation of his lease. The provisions of this section may be extended to pri- vate-dwellings and two-family dwellings, as may be found necessary by the health officer. Sec. 112. Infected and uninhabitable dwellings to be vacated. Whenever it shall be certified by an inspector or of- ficer of the health department that a dwelling, or any part thereof, is infected with contagious disease, or that it is un- fit for human habitation, or dangerous to life or health by reason of want of re- pair, or of defects in the drainage, plumbing, lighting, ventilation, or the construction of the same, or by reason of the existence on the premises of a nuisance likely to cause sickness among the occupants of said dwelling, or for any other cause, the health officer may issue an order requiring all persons therein to vacate such house, or part thereof, within not less than twenty- four hours nor more than ten days, for the reasons to be mentioned in said or- der. In case such order is not complied with within the time specified, the health officer may cause said dwelling or part thereof to be vacated. The health officer whenever he is satisfied that the danger from said dwelling or part thereof has ceased to exist, or that it is fit for human habitation, may revoke said order, or may extend the time within which to comply with the same. Sec. 113. Repairs to buildings, et cetera. Whenever any dwelling or any building, structure, excavation, business pursuit, matter or thing, in or about a dwelling, or the lot on which it is situ- ated, or the plumbing, sewerage, drain- age, light or ventilation thereof, is in the opinion of the health officer in a condition or in effect dangerous or detri- mental to life or health the health of- ficer may declare that the same, to the extent he may specify, is a public nui- sance, and may order the same to be removed, abated, suspended, altered or otherwise improved or purified, as the order shall specify. The health officer may also order or cause any dwelling or part thereof or any excavation building, structure, sewer, plumbing pipe, passage, premises, ground, matter or thing, in or about a dwelling, or the lot on which it is situated, to be purified, cleansed, dis- infected, removed, altered, repaired or improved. If any order of the health of- ficer issued under the authority of the provisions of this act is not complied with, or so far complied with as he may regard as reasonable, within five days after the service thereof, or within such shorter time as he may designate, then such order may be executed by said health officer through his officers, agents, employees or contractors. Sec. 114. Fire-escapes. The owner of every multiple-dwelling on which there are fire-escapes shall keep them in good order and repair, and whenever rusty shall have them properly painted with two coats of paint. No person shall at any time place any incumbrance of any kind before or upon any such fire-escape. Sec. 115. Scuttles, bulkheads, ladders and stairs. In all multiple-dwellings where there are scuttles or bulkheads. they and all stairs or ladders leading thereto, shall be easily accessible to all Occupants of the building, and shall be kept free from incumbrance, and ready for use at all times. No scuttle and no bulkhead door shall at any time be locked with a key, but either may be fastened on the inside by movable bolts or hooks. ARTICLE V. Improvements. In this article will be found those im- provements in the older buildings re- quired as a matter of compulsory legis- lation. Sec. 120. Rooms, lighting and venti- lation of. No room in a two-family dwelling or in a multiple-dwelling of class A erected prior to the passage of this act shall hereafter be occupied for living purposes unless it shall have a window of an area of not less than eight square feet opening directly upon the street, or upon a yard not less than ten feet deep, or above the roof of an ad- joining building, or upon a court of not &quot; &quot;Treads and Risers 269 6 2 1 0 64 10½ 1 1 62 634 1 12 7 1 2 7% 1 24 1 22 74 7% 72 7% 1 2 1 3 1 34 3 1 6 1 64 1 72 1 84 19 1 9% 1 94 1 10% 1 10% 1 1078 1 2 0 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 42 2 5 2 52 2 6 2 6½ 27 2 6 2 74 2 82 2 94 2 11 2 11% 3 04 3 078 3 1/2 3 2% 7 78 74 Table of of Treads and Risers 8 9 No. of 6 6¼1/4 62 64 73% 712 7% 734 77% 814 812 9/2 10 10/2 11 13 14 Treads Inch Rise.

Power Shaft Openings.-Openings for power shafts shall be provided with an approved type of fire stop on each side of the wall or floor, or preferably to fit shaft neat in wall or floor. DRAINAGE. Each floor shall be impervious to water, and arranged to drain away from floor openings; provision being made for discharging water at the rate of 300 gallons per minute per each 1,000 square feet of floor area. The lowest floor of the building shall be drained to a sump chamber, which is provided with adequate facilities for removing surplus water therefrom. SERVICE EQUIPMENT.

All electrical equipment shall be in- stalled in accordance with the require- ments of the National Electrical Code. &quot; &quot;12 Code of Ethics New York Society of Architects CODE OF ETHICS The architect should be ever mindful of his responsibilities and always worthy of that full measure of confidence reposed in him by those who place their financial, technical and aesthetic interests in his keeping; his chief aim and ambition should be to adequately conceive, design, and execute all building improvements with con- spicuous ability and unswerving devotion to the interests of his clients; he should be liberal in his treatment of his professional associates and subordinates, and fair and just to all contractors and others who defer to him and upon whom he must depend to pro- duce the physical results of his conceptions-he should be a man. in all that the word implies and in addition possess artistic, construc- tive and executive ability of the highest order. The Society reposes the utmost confidence in the integrity and the lofty ambitions of its members and leaves to the individual conscience the selection of an ethical path to follow, with every confidence in the result. The Society is mindful, however, of its sacred duty to prescribe a Code of Ethics for the guidance of its members in their duty to each other and to the public. An architect should not receive a commission, a substantial service or anything of value from an interested person other than a client, nor advertise in any form except in the signing or publi- cation of his work, nor enter any competition except upon terms. and conditions approved by the Society, nor intentionally injure the reputation, prospects, or professional standing of another architect, nor surreptitiously criticise the conduct or work of another architect, nor undertake a commission while the just claim of another archi- tect remains unsatisfied except with his consent, nor contribute in any manner detrimental to the title of architect. The Society deplores the frequency of excessive cost of build- ings above the architect&apos;s estimate and the tendency which this has to lower the standard of the architect&apos;s reliability. The assumption of the title of Architect should imply a guarantee of ability to the extent that the public has a right to expect and demand that his estimate shall be sufficient upon which to predicate financial ar- rangements to complete the work. &quot; &quot;114 Plumbing and Drainage Definition of Terms. 12. The term &amp;quot;private sewer&amp;quot; is applied to main sewers that are not con- structed by and under the supervision of the Department of Public Works. 13. The term &amp;quot;house sewer&amp;quot; is applied to that part of the main drain or sewer extending from a point two feet outside of the outer front wall of the build- ing, vault or area to its connection with public sewer, private sewer or cesspool. 14. The term &amp;quot;house drain&amp;quot; is applied to that part of the main horizontal drain and its branches inside the walls of the building, vault or area and extending to and connecting with the house sewer. 15. The term &amp;quot;soil line&amp;quot; is applied to any vertical line of pipe having outlets above the floor of first story for water-closet connections. 16. The term &amp;quot;waste line&amp;quot; is applied to any vertical line of pipe having outlets above the first floor for fixtures other than water-closet. 17. The term &amp;quot;vent pipe&amp;quot; is applied to any special pipe provided to ventilate the system of piping and to prevent trap siphonage and back pressure. Materials and Workmanship. 18.

Pres., &quot; &apos;Specifications for Standard Building 249 GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS. That a Standard Building may be con- structed to comply with any of the fol- lowing types:- 1. Where all loads are carried on walls. 2. Where there are exterior bearing walls and interior bearing columns. 3. Where all loads are carried on a protected structural skeleton of steel or reinforced concrete. That the allowable floor loads and wind stresses shall be such as to con- form to the best engineering practice. That the compressive stress on brick- work laid in cement mortar shall not exceed 15 tons per sq. ft. That the compressive stress on stone or gravel concrete shall not exceed 35 tons per sq. ft. That the quality of all materials used in the construction shall conform to the best engineering practice. That all work, whether fireproofing or construction, shall be installed under the constant supervision of a competent and reliable inspector. That no combustible material shall be used in the structure, partitions, or finish. DEFINITIONS. Approved. Wherever the word &quot;Ap- proved&quot; is used in these specifications, it refers to a device, material, or construc- tion approved by the National Fire Pro- tection Association. Cement. Wherever the word &quot;Ce- ment&quot; is used in these specifications, it refers to Portland cement that will meet the requirements of the American Soci- ety for Testing Materials. Concrete.-Concrete shall be com- posed of one part cement, and not more than six parts of aggregate consisting of sand, crushed stone, or gravel, with sufficient water to produce a wet mix- ture. Note-Attention is called to the fact that pure quartz gravel is not a good fire-resisting aggregate for concrete; also that limestone is likely to calcine and granite to spall when exposed to high heat. In construction that is likely to be subjected to attack of fire, it is best to avoid those aggre- gates where possible. Concrete Fill.-Fill for the top of floor or roof construction shall consist of con- crete made of one cement to ten cinders, crushed brick, slag, tile, or other suit- able incombustible material, with suf- ficient fine aggregate as a binder to pro- duce a dense mixture. Cement Mortar.-Shall be made of ce- ment and sand in the proportions of one part cement to not more than three parts sand by volume. Not more than 15 per cent of the cement by volume may be replaced by an equal volume of dry hydrated lime. Cement Plaster. Wherever the term &quot;Cement plaster&quot; is used, it shall mean &quot;plastered with cement mortar.&quot; Foundation Wall.-Any bearing wall or pier built below the curb or grade level. Exterior Wall.--Any outside wall, or vertical enclosure of a building, other than a party wall. Party Wall. A wall between two buildings separating two properties, but used jointly. Bearing Wall. One which supports any load other than its own weight. Non-Bearing Wall.-One which sup- ports no load other than its own weight. Curtain Wall.-Any non-bearing wall between columns or piers. Parapet Wall.-That portion of any wall which extends above the roof line and which bears no load. Fire Wall.A wall built for the pur- pose of restricting the area subject to the spread of fire. Fire Exit Partition.—A sub-dividing partition built for the purpose of pro- tecting life by providing an area of refuge. Fire-proofing. Any material and con- struction as shall meet the requirements of the fire test previously specified. WALLS. Foundation Walls.-Foundation walls shall be built of hard burned brick laid in cement mortar, or of concrete, and shall have a thickness 4 inches greater than the wall next above. Exterior walls shall be impervious to water, or be adequately waterproofed. The construction of buried footings is not considered a part of these speci- fications. Retaining Walls.-Retaining walls, if built of stone, must be plastered on the exposed side with 34 inch of cement mor- tar. Exterior, Interior, Party, and Fire Walls. All such walls shall be built of hard burned brick, laid with flush joints of cement mortar, or of reinforced con- crete. Veneered walls not permitted. All party or lot line walls shall extend 3 feet above the roof as a parapet, shall be the full minimum thickness, and shall be properly coped. Fire walls shall be continuous from foundation to 3 feet above roof level and be coped; except that interior fire walls need not extend above roof. Thickness of Walls.-No exterior wall shall be less than 12 inches thick. No party nor fire wall shall be less than 16 inches thick. &apos; &quot;American Institute of Architects 29 THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS Vice-President. President First Second Vice-President.

In all buildings occupied as stores, dwellings, lodging or boarding houses, hotels, offices, lofts, workshops, factories or storage houses, there must be at least one water-closet in each building. There must be sufficient water-closets so that there will never be more than 15 persons to each water-closet. In places of public assembly the number of toilets and the most available location are to be determined by the Superintendent of Buildings. 122. Separate water closets and toilet rooms must be provided for each sex in buildings used as workshops, lofts, office buildings, factories, hotels and all places of public assembly. 123. In lodging houses there must be one water-closet on each floor, and where there are more than 15 persons on any floor there must be an additional water-closet on that floor for every 15 additional persons or fraction thereof. 124. In tenement houses, lodging houses, factories, workshops, and all public buildings, the entire water-closet apartment and side walls to a height of six inches from the floor, except at the door, must be made waterproof with asphalt, cement, tile, metal or other waterproof material as approved by the Superin- tendent of Buildings. 125.

Tests conducted showed that on December 18, 1911, with an outdoor temperature of 37°, the average temperature and relative humidity on the first floor was 682° and 54 per cent. respectively. On the second floor the average temperature was 70° and the relative humidity 46 per cent. Ventilation should mean the conditioning of the air of any enclosed space to the best requirements of the occupants of that space; conditioning of the air so that the human machine may work under the most favorable conditions-this is one of the chief elements of industrial efficiency, as it is of individual health and happiness. A room or building may be well-ventilated from a hygienic standpoint, and still be deemed uncomfortable to live in by being over or under-heated. This is why the question of heating and ventilating have to be considered together. As individuals contaminate the air of habitation, sufficient fresh air must be admitted and an equal amount expelled or withdrawn until the air within the building is kept at a degree of purity very nearly equal to the purity of the outdoor air. In how many school buildings throughout the land are our children impris- oned for five hours every school day, in air which sends them home unnerved, suffering with a lassitude from which even hours of play cannot relieve them. It has already been proved by a series of experiments, that pupils in out-of-door school-rooms show vast superiority, both mentally and physically, in an almost incredibly short time. Then no argument is needed to prove that for indoor schools every effort must be made to install the very best possible substitute for an out-of-door atmosphere. It seems just as unreasonable to lay down rules or standards for ventilation systems as it is for a water-works engineer to say that one method or standard of water purification must be applied to all cases. Each city has its own peculiar conditions, its problems of water purification to solve. Just so each building and each room in a building has its own problem of ventilation. The modern consensus of opinion is that a certain volume of air was essen- tial in densely occupied rooms for the elimination of heat and moisture and for the maintenance of air movement. It is not so much the volume of air which is put in as where and how it is put in. Seventeen cubic feet of air will furnish enough extractable oxygen for a man for one hour, if all the oxygen could be extracted and if the exhaled air high in carbon-dioxide and in moisture was kept entirely away from the air to be inhaled. But this is absolutely impracticable. In a given installation the quantity of air needed is in inverse proportion to the separation of exhaled or foul air from the fresh air. If we can arrange our air inlets and outlets tight and hold our window and wall chill to a minimum 1,000 cubic feet per person per hour would not be very wrong. If the so-called diffusion method (down- ward ventilation) is used, namely fresh air admitted under ceiling and foul air exhausted near floor, at least 2,000 cubic feet per hour per person is required. Where there is intelligent effort to move air uniform in one direction, 1,500 cubic feet per person per hour might be sufficient. A very important point in connection with ventilation is the proper diffusion of the air. In other words, we can have very good air in some parts of the room, and very bad air in other parts, and consequently the problem of ventilation is not only that of introducing a certain quantity of fresh air into the room and exhausting an equal quantity of foul air, but it also includes that of perfectly distributing and circulating that air. Therefore, the study of arrangement of the ducts and inlets and outlets must be done with great care, and here it is where there should be a closer co-operation between the work of the architect and that of the heating and ventilating engineer. Fresh air should never be introduced without being previously heated to at least the temperature of 68 degrees. Otherwise objectionable drafts would be felt. The problems encountered in the ventilation of large hotels are probably the most difficult of any class of buildings and the portion of the hotel which must be handled with particular care is the kitchen. The kitchen is usually located in the portion of the building which is entirely below the ground level, with no outside ex- posure, and because of the large amount of cooking done and the intense heat generated from the ranges, steam kettles, broilers, etc., it is very difficult to pre- vent odors from reaching other portions of the building. The dining rooms and restaurants are usually directly over the kitchen, and &quot; &quot;Elevators 133 ELEVATORS Bureau of Buildings. Regulations for Their Construction, Inspection and Operation. Adopted by the Superintendent of Buildings, All Boroughs. 1. The term &amp;quot;elevator,&amp;quot; as used in these Regulations, shall include all ele- vators or lifts used for the carrying of passengers or employees. The term &amp;quot;dumbwaiter&amp;quot; shall include such special form of elevator, the dimensions of which do not exceed nine square feet in horizontal section, and four feet in height, and which is used for the con- veyance of small packages and mer- chandise. So far as practicable, these Regulations shall also apply to escala- tors. Where freight elevators are placed within the same shaft enclosure as pas- senger elevators, such elevators must conform in all particulars to the regula- tions for the construction, inspection and operation of passenger elevators. All other freight elevators must comply with Sections 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 of the &amp;quot;Regulations for Passenger Elevators.&amp;quot; Any hand-power elevator having a rise of more than thirty-five feet shall com- ply with all the requirements of these Regulations. No belt elevators driven from a countershaft shall be installed for passenger service. 2. All elevators must be inspected as often as possible by an inspector of the Bureau of Buildings, known and desig- nated as an inspector of elevators, in accordance with the rules and regula- tions of the bureau prescribing the du- ties and governing the actions of the employees. 3. Before any elevator shall hereafter be installed or altered in any building, the owner or his agent, architect or contractor shall submit, on appropriate blanks furnished therefor, to the Super- intendent of Buildings, an application in triplicate stating the construction and mode of operation of such elevator to be installed or altered, and shall obtain his approval therefor. This application shall be accompanied by such plans and drawings as may be necessary. Before any such elevator shall be put into serv- ice, the same shall have been duly tested and inspected under the super- vision of an inspector of elevators and a certificate of such inspection issued and a formal approval obtained from the Superintendent of Buildings. In making any changes or alterations to elevator shafts, rails, overhead machin- ery or power, all the work changed or altered must be made to conform to the present law and regulations. 4. The owner, lessee, manager or other persons having charge or control of any elevator now in operation and the manufacturer of any such elevator hereafter placed in any building, shall cause to be fastened in a conspicuous place in said elevator a metal plate, hav- ing suitable raised letters on same, which shall designate the number of pounds weight which said elevator shali be permitted to carry, but in no case shall a carrying capacity of less than 75 lbs. per square foot of platform area inside the car be permitted on any pas- senger elevator. 5. Every elevator, except full auto- matic push button elevators in private dwellings occupied by one family, must be in charge of a competent operator of reliable and industrious habits, not less than eighteen years of age, with at least one month&apos;s experience in running an elevator under the instruction of a com- petent person. In case the Superin- tendent of Buildings shall become satis- fied that the person engaged in running any elevator is incompetent or disquali- fied from any cause to continue to run the same, the owner or person manag- ing or controlling the elevator shall, upon notice from the Superintendent of Buildings, at once replace the said op- erator by a competent operator. 6. Elevator shafts and doors of same in non-fireproof buildings must be con- structed fireproof and made solid for their full height. Any lights that may be desired in these doors must be pro- vided with wire glass. No one pane of wire glass shall exceed five square feet in area. No more than one opening in the elevator shaft will be allowed on each floor, and all openings in the sev- eral stories shall be one above the other, unless the elevator is used exclusively for freight purposes, except that where the operating device of the elevator is so placed that the operator can readily &quot; &quot;liii Fredenburg &amp;amp; Lounsbury 381 FOURTH AVENUE, Corner 27th Street NEW YORK Nearly Three Million FACE BRICKS, Furnished to EQUITABLE BUILDING ALL KINDS ALL TEXTURES Largest Distributors of Front Brick in the World Telephone: Murray Hill 4460 G.

Sec. 242-a. The board of estimate and apportionment shall have power to regulate and limit the height and bulk of buildings hereafter erected and to regulate and determine the area of yards, courts and other open spaces. The board may divide the city into districts of such number, shape and area as it may deem best suited to carry out the purposes of this section. The regulations as to the height and bulk of buildings and the area of yards, courts and other open spaces shall be uniform for each class of buildings throughout each district. The regulations in one or more districts may differ from those in other districts. Such regulations shall be designed to secure safety from fire and other dangers and to promote the public health and welfare, including, so far as conditions may permit, provision for adequate light, air and convenience of access. The board shall pay reasonable regard to the character of buildings erected in each district, the value of the land and the use to which it may be put to the end that such regulations may promote public health, safety and welfare and the mst desirable use for which the land of each district may be adapted and may tend to conserve the value of buildings and enhance the value of land throughout the city. The board shall appoint a commission to recommend the boundaries of districts and appropriate regulations to be enforced therein. Such commission shall make a tentative report and hold public hearings thereon at such times and places as said board shall require before submitting its final report. Said board shall not deter- mine the boundaries of any district nor impose any regulation until after the final report of a commission so appointed. After such final report said board shall afford persons interested an opportunity to be heard at a time and place to be specified in a notice of hearing to be published for ten consecutive days in the City Record. LOCATION OF INDUSTRIES AND BUILDINGS. Sec. 242-b. The board of estimate and apportionment may regulate and restrict the location of trades and industries and the location of buildings designed for specified uses, and may divide the city into districts of such number, shape and area as it may deem best suited to carry out the purposes of this section. For each such district regulations may be imposed designating the trades and industries that shall be excluded or subjected to special regulations and desig- nating the uses for which buildings may not be erected or altered. Such regula- tions shall be designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare. The board shall give reasonable consideration, among other things, to the char- acter of the district, its peculiar suitability for particular uses, the conservation of property values, and the direction of building development in accord with a well considered plan. The board shall appoint a commission to recommend the boundaries of districts and appropriate regulations and restrictions to be imposed therein. Such commission shall make a tentative report and hold public hearings thereon before submitting its final report at such time as said board shall require. Said board shall not determine the boundaries of any district nor impose any regulations or restrictions until after the final report of a commission so appointed. After such final report said board shall afford persons interested an opportunity to be heard at a time and place to be specified in a notice of hearing to be pub- lished for ten consecutive days in the City Record. Sec. 2. This act shall take effect immediately. &quot; &quot;232 Workmen&apos;s Compensation Law necessary to protect the interest of the beneficiary may be required, to make deposits to secure the prompt and con- venient payment of such compensation. Sec. 26. Enforcement of payment in default. If payment of compensation, or an installment thereof, due under the terms of an award, be not made with- in ten days after the same is due, by the employer or insurance corporation liable therefor, the amount of such pay- ment shall constitute a liquidated claim for damages against such employer or insurance corporation, which with an added penalty of fifty per centum may be recovered in action to be instituted by the commission in the name of the people of the state. If such default be made in the payment of an installment of compensation and the whole amount of such compensation be not due, the commission may, if the present value of such compensation be computable, de- clare the whole amount thereof due, and recover the amount thereof with the added penalty of fifty per centum, as provided by this section. Any such action may be compromised by the com- mission or may be prosecuted to final judgment as, in the discretion of the commission, may best serve the interests of the persons entitled to receive the compensation or the benefits. Compen- sation recovered under this section shall be disbursed by the commission to the persons entitled thereto in accordance with the award. A penalty recovered pursuant to this section shall be paid into the state treasury, and be appli- cable to the expenses of the commission. em- Sec. 27. Depositing future payments. If an award under this chapter requires payment of compensation by an ployer or an insurance corporation in periodical payments, and the nature of the injury makes it possible to compute the present value of all future payments with due regard for life contingencies, the commission may, in its discretion, at any time, compute and permit or require to be paid into the state fund an amount equal to the present value of all unpaid compensation for which liability exists, in trust; and thereupon such employer or insurance corporation shall be discharged from any further liability under such award and payment of the same shall be assumed by the state fund. Sec. 28. Limitation of right to com- pensation. The right to claim compensa- tion under this chapter shall be forever barred unless within one year after the injury, or if death result therefrom, within one year after such death, a claim for compensation thereunder shall be filed with the commission. Sec. 29. Subrogation to remedies of employee. If a workman entitled to com- pensation under this chapter be injured or killed by the negligence or wrong of another and not in the same employ, such injured workman, or in case of death, his dependents, shall, before any suit or claim under this chapter, elect whether to take compensation un- der this chapter or to pursue his rem- edy against such other. Such election shall be evidenced in such manner as the commission may by rule or regula- tion prescribe. If he elect to take com- pensation under this chapter, the cause of action against such other shall be assigned to the state for the benefit of the state insurance fund, if compensa- tion be payable therefrom, and otherwise to the person or association or corpora- tion liable for the payment of such com- pensation, and if he elect to proceed against such other, the state insurance fund, person or association or corpora- tion, as the case may be, shall contribute only the deficiency, if any, between the amount of the recovery against such other person actually collected, and the compensation provided or estimated by this chapter for such use. Such a cause of action assigned to the state may be prosecuted or compromised by the com- mission. A compromise of any such cause of action by the workman or his dependents at an amount less than the compensation provided for by this chap- ter shall be made only with the written approval of the commission, if the de- ficiency of compensation would be pay- able from the state insurance fund, and otherwise with the written approval of the person, association or corporation liable to pay the same. Sec. 30. Revenues or benefits from other sources not to affect compensa- tion. No benefits, savings or insurance of the injured employee, independent of the provisions of this chapter, shall be considered in determining the com- pensation or benefits to be paid under this chapter. Sec. 31. Agreement for contribution by employee void. No agreement by an employee to pay any portion of the premium paid by his employer to the state insurance fund or to contribute to a benefit fund or department main- tained by such employer or to the cost of mutual insurance or other insurance, maintained for or carried for the pur- pose of providing compensation as herein required, shall be valid, and any employer who makes a deduction for such purpose from the wages or sal- ary of any employee entitled to the benefits of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Sec. 32. Waiver agreements void. No agreement by an employee to waive his right to compensation under this chapter shall be valid. &quot; &quot;Reinforced Concrete 127 Reinforced Concrete Regulations of the Bureau of Buildings for All Boroughs of New York City. 1.

PROSTITUTION IN TENEMENT HOUSES. Sec. 150. (Vagrancy.)—A woman who knowingly resides in a house of prostitution or assignation of any description in a tenement house or who commits prostitution or indecently exposes her person for the purpose of prostitution in, or who solicits any man or boy to enter a house of prostitution or a room in a tenement house for the purpose of prostitution, shall be deemed a vagrant, and upon conviction thereof shall be committed to the county jail for a term not exceeding six months from the date of commitment. The procedure in such case shall be the same as that provided by law for other cases of vagrancy. Sec. 151. (Lien.)-A tenement house shall be subject to a penalty of one thousand dollars, if it or any part of it shall be used for the purpose of a house of prostitution or assignation of any description, with the permission of the owner thereof, or his agent, and said penalty shall be a lien upon the house and the lot upon which the house is situated. Sec. 152. (Permission of Lessee.)-If a tenement house, or any part thereof, shall be used for the purpose of a house of prostitution or assignation of any description with the per- mission of the lessee of the whole of said tenement house, or his agent, the lease shall be terminable at the election of the lessor. And the owner shall be entitled to recover possession of said tenement house by summary proceedings in the man- ner provided by title two of chapter seventeen of the code of civil procedure. Sec. 153. (Permission of Owner.)-A tenement house shall be deemed to have been used for the purpose specified in the last two sections with the permission of the owner and lessee thereof, if summary proceedings for the removal of the tenants of said tenement house, or of so much thereof as is unlawfully used, shall not have been commenced within five days after notice of such unlawful use, served by the tenement house department in the manner prescribed by law for the serv- ice of notices and orders in relation to tenement houses. Sec. 154. (Rules of Evidence.)—In a prosecution against an owner or agent of a tenement house under section eleven hundred and forty-six of the penal law, or in an action to establish a lien under section one hundred and fifty-one of this chapter, the general reputation of the premises in the neigh- borhood shall be competent evidence, but shall not be su}fi- cient to support a judgment without corroborative evidence, and it shall be presumed that their use was with the permis- sion of the owner and lessee; provided, that such presump- tion may be rebutted by evidence. Sec. 155. (Title of Action and Parties.)-Said action shall be brought against the tenement house as defendant. Said house may be described in the title of the action by its street number, or in any other method sufficiently precise to secure identification. The property shall be described in the com- plaint. The plaintiff, except as hereinafter provided, shall be the tenement house department. In case any taxpayer of any Icity to which this chapter applies, shall request such depart- ment in writing to institute an action under this article against any tenement house specified in such request, and such de- partment shall not institute such action within ten days after receiving such request, then any taxpayer of said city may institute and maintain such action against such tenement house in his own name, and in such case the court may in its discre- tion require security for costs.

All pipe should be the standard-tested-known brand-&amp;quot;NATIONAL&amp;quot; -if you wish your pipe lines to be permanent and ultimately most economical. The following paragraph would be a good one to cut out and paste down where you and every one else would see it when ordering pipe: ¶ &amp;quot;All pipe to be &apos;NATIONAL&apos; Pipe as manufactured by National Tube Company, sizes 3/4&amp;quot; and larger to have the name &apos;NATIONAL&apos; rolled in raised letters on every few feet of length, and on the smaller butt-weld sizes the name &apos;NATIONAL&apos; to appear on the metal tag attached to each bundle of pipe.&amp;quot; Ask for &amp;quot;NATIONAL&amp;quot; Bulletin No. 12-this bulletin has recently been enlarged and revised and contains a summary of information about &amp;quot;NATIONAL&amp;quot; Pipe. When you read it you will keep it on file for permanent use. It&apos;s free. To readily identify &amp;quot;NATIONAL&amp;quot; material, and as protection to man- ufacturer and consumer alike, the practice of Na- tional Tube Company is to roll in raised letters of good size on each few feet of every length of welded pipe the name &amp;quot;NATIONAL&amp;quot; (except on the smaller butt-weld sizes, on which this is not mechanically feasible; on these smaller butt- weld sizes the name &amp;quot;NATIONAL&amp;quot; appears on the metal tag attached to each bundle of pipe). MARKING NATIONAL Name Rolled in Raised Letters on National Tube Company Pipe. When writing specifi- cations or ordering tubu- lar goods always specify &amp;quot;NATIONAL&amp;quot; Pipe, and identify as indicated. In addition. all sizes of &amp;quot;NATIONAL&amp;quot; welded pipe below four or five inches are subjected to a roll-knobbling process known as Spellerizing to lessen the tendency to cor- rosion, especially in the form of pitting. This Spel- lerizing process is pecu- liar to &amp;quot;NATIONAL&amp;quot; pipe, to which process National Tube Company has exclusive rights.

In this article will be found the pro- visions which must be observed when a person proposes to build a new dwelling or to convert or alter to such purposes a building which is not a dwelling. Title 1.-LIGHT AND VENTILATION. Sec. 20. Percentage of lot occu- pied. No dwelling hereafter erected shall occupy, either alone or with other buildings, a greater percentage of the area of the lot than as follows: (a) In the case of corner lots with streets on three sides, not more than ninety per centum; (b) In the case of other corner lots, not more than eighty-five per centum; (c) In the case of interior lots which do not exceed sixty feet in depth, not more than seventy per centum; (d) In the case of interior lots which exceed sixty feet in depth, not more than sixty per centum. For purposes of this section the measurements may be taken at the floor level of the lowest bedroom story. No measurements of lot area shall include any portion of any street or alley. Any portion of a corner lot distant more than seventy feet from the corner line shall be treated as an interior lot. Sec. 21. Height. No dwelling here- hereafter erected shall exceed in height the width of the widest street upon which it abuts nor in any case shall it exceed one hundred feet in height. Such width of street shall be measured from building line to opposite building line. The provisions of this section shall not apply to hotels. Sec. 22. Yards. Immediately be- hind every dwelling hereafter erected there shall be a rear yard extending across the entire width of the lot. Such yard shall be at every point open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky, except that in the case of hotels the rear yard may start at the floor level of the lowest bedroom story. In the case of dwellings where the rear yard abuts an alley not less than sixteen feet in width, where there are stores on the ground floor, such yard may start at the top of the entrance story. Every part of such yard shall be directly accessible from every other part thereof. The depth of said yard shall be measured at right angles from the rear lot line to the extreme rear part of the house, and shall be proportionate to the height of the dwelling: (a) In the case of corner lots no rear yard shall be less than fifteen feet in depth; (b) In the case of corner lots with streets on three sides the rear yard need not extend across the full width of the lot, but only to its median line; in the case of hotels located on such lots no yard need be provided; (c) In the case of interior lots which exceed sixty feet in depth no rear yard shall be less than thirty feet in depth; (d) In the case of lots which are sixty feet or less in depth, the rear yard shall be in no case less than fifteen feet deep. If the dwelling exceeds three stories in height, the depth above prescribed shall in each case be increased five feet for each story above three stories. If the dwelling is less than three stories in height, the depths above prescribed may be decreased five feet for each story be- ow three stories, but no rear yard shall be less than fifteen feet in depth. A front yard may be any depth. Any por- tion of a corner lot distant more than seventy feet from the corner line shall be treated as an interior lot. Sec. 23. Side yards. No side yard is required for dwellings hereafter erect- ed, but where such side yard is left it shall be at every point open and unob- structed from the ground to the sky and shall never be less in size than as fol- lows: (a) In the case of private dwellings which do not exceed fifty feet in depth, the width of such side yard measured to the side lot line shall never be less than five feet in any part; (b) In the case of private dwellings which exceed fifty feet in depth, the width of such side yard measured to the side lot line shall never be less than six feet in any part; (c) In the case of two-family dwell- ings, not exceeding two stories in height, and which do not exceed fifty feet in depth, the width of such side yard measured to the side lot line shall never be less than six feet in any part; (d) In the case of all other two- family dwellings the side yard shall be deemed a court and shall be subject to all the provisions of this act relative thereto; (e) In the case of all multiple dwell- ings the side yard shall be deemed a court and shall be subject to all the provisions of this act relative thereto. Sec. 24. Courts. The sizes of all courts in dwellings hereafter erected shall be proportionate to the height of the dwelling. No court shall be less in any part than the minimum sizes pre- scribed in this section. The minimum width of a court for a one-story dwell- &quot; &quot;40 Fire Limits New York City dred feet southwest of and parallel to the southwest side of 60th st. to New York Bay, thence running northerly along the pierhead line of New York Bay, Gowanus Bay, Buttermilk Channel and the East River to the point of beginning; Also, beginning at a point at the intersection of the Atlantic Ocean and W. 5th st., thence running northerly along the centre line of W. 5th st. to a point one hundred feet north of the northerly side of Surf ave., thence running westerly one Dundred feet north of and parallel to the northerly side of Surf ave., to W. 8th st., thence running westerly along the southerly side of the right of way of the Nor- ton&apos;s Point Railroad to W. 37th st., provided that at no point along said right of way shall these limits be taken at a distance less than one hundred feet north of the northerly side of Surf ave., thence running southerly along the centre line of W. 37th st. to the Atlantic Ocean, thence running easterly along the shore line to the point of beginning; RESTRICTED PARTS OF BROOKLYN.

Outlets for gas ranges shall have a diameter not less than required for six burners, and all gas ranges and heaters shall have a straightway cock on service pipe. 192. When brass piping is used on the outside of plastering or woodwork it shall be classed as fixtures. 193. All brass tubing used for arms and stems of fixtures shall be at least No. 18 standard gauge and full size outside so as to cut a full thread. All threads on brass pipe shall screw in at least 5-16 of an inch. All rope or square tubing shall be brazed or soldered into fittings and distributors, or have a nipple brazed into the tubing. 194. All cast fittings, such as cocks, swing joints, double centres, nozzles, etc., shall be extra heavy brass. The plugs of all cocks must be ground to a smooth and true surface for their entire length, be free from sandholes, have not less than 3/4 of an inch bearing (except in cases of special design), have two flat sides on the end for the washer, and have two nuts instead of a tail screw. All stop pins to keys or cocks shall be screwed into place. 195. After all piping is fitted and fastened and all outlets capped up, there must be applied by the plumber, in the presence of an inspector of the Bureau of Buildings, a test with air to pressure equal to a column of mercury 6 inches in height, and the same to stand for five minutes; only mercury gauge shall be used. No piping shall be covered up, nor shall any fixture, gas heater or range be con- nected thereto until a card showing the approval of this test has been issued by the Superintendent of Buildings. 196. No meter will be set by any gas company until a certificate is filed with them from the Bureau of Buildings certifying that the gas pipes and fixtures comply with the foregoing rules. 197. When for any reason it may be impracticable to comply strictly with the foregoing rules, the Superintendent of Buildings shall have power to modify their provisions so that the spirit and substance thereof shall be complied with. Such modifications shall be indorsed upon the permit over the signature of the Superin- tendent of Buildings. &quot; &apos;300 BRICK WORK After an inexhaustible research and thorough investigation, including the severest fire and water tests that could be applied to building construction, we do not hesitate to say that brick- work far surpasses that of any other form of constructional work now known to science. Either structural steel or concrete meas- ures up to commercial tests, as generally known, but where these materials have been subjected to extreme heat and streams of water have then been applied to buildings constructed of these materials, under these conditions the results have been disastrous. Building brick in the course of manufacture is subjected to from 2800 to 4000 degrees fahrenheit, and all the combustible material has been consumed, consequently no fire test that can be hereafter applied will effect this indestructible product. As a result of this, and because of the economy of transportation and the facility with which this material can be laid in a building, there is a very noticeable &quot;back to brick&quot; movement in all forms of construction. The crushing test likewise demonstrates superiority of this material. Hard, well-burned brick, such as that manufactured in the Hudson River Valley, will withstand a test of from 3000 to 5000 pounds per square inch. There can be no economy, there- fore, in using other material. A further proof of the indestructibility of brick, which other building materials cannot claim, is the fact that when buildings are torn down, common brick can be readily cleaned and economi- cally delivered and relaid, without showing any marked deterior- ation in the new construction. &apos; &apos;292 Ventilation the natural tendency of the odors is to rise. In order to eliminate this a plenus condition must be produced in the dining rooms, restaurants, lobbies, and all rooms from which odors must be kept and which are in any way connected with the kitchen or other rooms where objectionable odors may arise. This is accomplished by exhausting with the exhaust fans only about 60 to 70 per cent. as much air as is blown in by the supply fans. In the kitchen and similar rooms a vacuum con- dition must be produced by exhausting at least 50 per cent. more air by supply fans. These unbalanced conditions in the two portions of the building produce a steady current of air flowing from the upper rooms down through doors and con- necting passageways to the kitchen and out through the kitchen exhaust ducts, thus preventing the odors reaching the dining rooms. The ventilation of the ranges and all cooking apparatus must be handled by entirely separate system. They must be provided with a separate hood over the top which entirely covers the space above the apparatus. An exhaust duct should be taken from the top of each hood, and these ducts combine into one main flue leading to an exhaust fan, which should discharge above the roof through a vent cap. Impurities in the air of buildings, are in the form of gases, odors, and dust. In the list of the gases, we find carbon-dioxide. The common index of vitiation due either to human beings or to lighting and heating appliances is carbon-dioxide, but carbon-dioxide in itself has no harmful effect in tenfold the concentration it ever reaches in ordinary factory air. It was long believed that the carbon-dioxide was an index of some subtle and mysterious &quot;crown poison.&quot; All attempts to prove the existence of such poisons have incontinently failed. There are very perceptible odors in an ill-ventilated room, due to decomposing organic matter on the bodies, in the mouths and on the clothes of the occupants. The principal value of the carbon-dioxide test to-day lies in the fact that under ordinary conditions high carbon-dioxide indicates that there are no air cur- rents changing the atmosphere about the bodies of the occupants. However, there can be no doubt that when carbon-dioxide is present in the air of a moving picture theatre in the proportion of 42 to 70 parts in 10,000, as has been found in the Chicago theatre investigations, this may be regarded as a satisfactory indication that the air is seriously deficient. It is conceded now that an examination into the purity of the air in buildings where a ventilating system has been, or is going to be installed, should involve much more than a simple and rather doubtful test for carbon-dioxide. The tem- perature, the humidity, the amount of dust, the number of people, the character and employment of the occupants, the number of continuous hours of occupancy, the height and shape of the rooms, the nature of the outside air to be drawn in, all these and many other factors must be taken into account in the installation of a ventilating system. The chief factors in air conditioning for the living machine, the factors which in most cases far outweigh all others put together, are the temperature and hu- midity of the air. If the air has been too hot or too dry or too moist the effect on comfort and efficiency has been worse than NIL. Heat and particularly heat combined with excessive humidity, is the one condition in air that has been proved beyond a doubt to be universally a cause of discomfort, inefficiency and disease. Flugge and his pupil in Germany, and also Haldane in England, have shown that when the temperature rises to 80 degrees Fahr., with moderate humidity, or much above 70 degrees with high humidity, depression, headache, dizziness, and the other symptoms associated with badly ventilated rooms begin to manifest themselves. At 78 degrees with saturated air, Haldane found that the temperature of the body itself began to rise. The wonderful heat-regulating mechanism which enables us to adjust ourselves to our environment has broken down, and an actual state of fever has set in. The main point in the air conditioning is, then, the maintenance of a low temperature and of a humidity not too excessive. For maximum efficiency the temperature should never pass 70 degrees and the humidity should not be above 70 per cent. of saturation. It would probably be desirable to keep the relative humidity between 50 and 60 per cent. Many buildings are provided with apparatus for supplying pure air, but with no means of regulating the amount of moisture, in the air, consequently, the air is usually too dry. Dry air desicates the mucous membrane, hence it conduces to infections. Laryngitis bronchitis, and kindred diseases soon follow. &apos; &quot;iv Impartial and Invaluable Assistance always at the Command of Architects There is no ironclad rule governing elevator specifications. Each building demands special study if the elevators are to supply the service they should. Don&apos;t trouble yourself with these elevator problems. Put that burden on our shoulders. We are always willing to help, without charge. We can help. We haven&apos;t been in the elevator industry for over fifty-eight years without meeting all sorts of conditions and learning how to determine always the right kind of elevator to install. And our branches in all cities bring the assistance of our experience to your door.

PROPORTIONAL THICKNESS-The thickness of metal shall not be less than one-twelfth the diameter or the greatest lateral dimension of cross section, but never less than three-quarters of an inch. Wherever the core of a cast-iron column has shifted more than one-fourth the thickness of the shell, the strength shall be computed assuming the thickness of metal all around equal to the thin- nest part, and the column shall be condemned if this computation shows the strength to be less than required by this code. IMPERFECTIONS.-Wherever blowholes or imperfections are found in a cast-iron column which reduces the area of the cross-section at that point more than ten per cent., such column shall be condemned. TESTING THICKNESS.-Cast-iron posts or columns not cast with one open side or back, before being set up in place, shall have a three-eighths of an inch hole drilled in the shaft of each post or column, by the manufacturer or contractor furnishing the same, to exhibit the thickness of the castings; and any other sim- ilar sized hole or holes which the commissioner of buildings may require shall be drilled in the said posts or columns by the said manufacturer or contractor at his own expense. SHOES.-Iron or steel shoes or plates shall be used under the bottom tier of columns to properly distribute the load on the foundation. Shoes shall be placed on top. Sec. 113. (Double Columns.) SUPPORTING WALL ABOVE. In all buildings hereafter erected or altered, where any iron or steel column or columns are used to support a wall or part thereof, whether the same be an exterior or an interior wall, and columns located below the level of the sidewalk, which are used to support exterior walls or arches over vaults, the said column or columns shall be either constructed double, that is, an outer and an inner column, the inner column alone to be of sufficient strength to sustain safely the weight to be imposed thereon, and the outer columns shall be one inch shorter than the inner columns, or such other iron or steel column of sufficient strength and protected with not less than two inches of fireproof material securely applied, except that double or protected columns shall not be required for walls fronting on streets or courts. Sec. 114. (Party Wall Posts.) THICKNESS AND DEPTH.-If iron or steel posts are to be used as party posts in front of a party wall, and intended for two buildings, then the said posts shall be not less in width than the thickness of the party wall, nor less in depth than the thickness of the wall to be supported above. Iron or steel posts in front of side, division or party walls, shall be filled up with solid masonry and made perfectly tight between the posts and walls. Intermediate posts may be used, which shall be sufficiently strong, and the lintels thereon shall have suffi- cient bearings to carry the weight above with safety. Sec. 115. (Plates Between Joints of Open Back Columns.) Iron or steel posts or columns with one or more open sides and backs shall have solid iron plates on top of each, except where pierced for the passage of pipes. Sec. 116. (Steel and Iron Girders.) Rivets in flanges shall be spaced so that the last value of a rivet for either shear or bearing is equal or greater than the increment of strain due to the dis- tance between adjoining rivets. All other rules given under riveting shall be followed. The lengths of rivets between heads shall be limited to four times the diameter. The compression flange of plate girders shall be secured against buckling, if its length exceeds thirty times its width. If splices are used, they shall fully make good the members spliced in either tension or compression. Stiffeners shall be provided over supports and under concentrated loads; they shall be of sufficient strength as a column, to carry the loads, and shall be connected with a sufficient number of rivets to transmit the stresses into the web plate. Stiffeners shall fit so as to support the flange of the girders. If the unsupported depth of the web plate exceeds sixty times its thickness, stiffeners shall be used at intervals not exceeding one hundred and twenty times the thickness of the web. &quot; &quot;56 Building Code light manufacturing purposes they are to be the full dead load and seventy-five per cent. of the live load established by section 130 of this code. PUBLIC BUILDINGS.-In churches, school houses and places of public amuse- ment or assembly, they are to be the full dead load and seventy-five per cent. of the live load established by section 130 of this code. OFFICE BUILDINGS, HOTELS, DWELLINGS.-In office buildings, hotels, dwellings, apartment houses, tenement houses, lodging-houses and stables they are to be the full dead load and sixty per cent. of the live load established by section 130 of this code. UNIFORM PRESSURE.-Footings will be so designed that the loads will be as nearly uniform as possible and not in excess of the safe bearing capacity of the soil, as established by section 23 of this code. Sec. 25. (Foundations.) DEPTH REQUIRED.-Every building, except buildings erected upon solid rock or buildings erected upon wharves and piers on the water front, shall have foundations of brick, stone, iron, steel or concrete laid not less than four feet below the surface of the earth, on the solid ground or level surface of rock, or upon piles or ranging timbers when solid earth or rock is not found. PILES. Piles intended to sustain a wall, pier or post shall be spaced not more than thirty-six or less than twenty inches on centres, and they shall be driven to a solid bearing, if practicable to do so, and the number of such piles shall be sufficient to support the superstructure proposed. No pile shall be used of less dimensions than five inches at the butt for short piles, or piles twenty feet or less in length, and twelve inches at the butt for long piles, or piles more than twenty feet in length. LOADS ON PILES.-No pile shall be weighted with a load exceeding forty thousand pounds. When a pile is not driven to refusal, its safe sustaining power shall be determined by the following formula: Twice the weight of the hammer in tons multiplied by the height of the fall in feet divided by least penetration of pile under the last blow in inches plus one. The commissioner of buildings shall be notified of the time when such test piles will be driven, that he may be present in person or by representative.

ALTERATIONS.-Frame buildings may be altered, extended, raised or re- paired, provided the new portions comply with the provisions of this section. TENEMENT.-No frame building exceeding three stories in height shall hereafter be erected to be occupied by more than six families, nor shall any frame building already erected be altered to be occupied by more than six families, nor more than three stories in height. MODIFICATIONS: BRICK BUILDINGS.-Outside of fire limits, when any brick or stone building is to be erected of a class that could, under this code, be constructed of wood, the Commissioner of Buildings having jurisdiction is hereby authorized and directed to allow reasonable modifications of this code relating to brick buildings, in consideration of incombustible material being used for walls instead of wood. Sec. 147. (Frame Buildings; Where Streets Are Not Established.) Within portions of the city of New York where streets have not been or are not legally established and are outside of the prescribed fire limits, no building or structure other than small out-houses shall be erected without first filing plans and a detailed statement of the proposed construction and obtaining an approval therefor, as provided in section 4 of this code. HOTELS AND PLACES OF ASSEMBLY.-Within the said portion of the city of New York, hotels, tenement houses for occupancy by not more than six fami- lies, and places of public assembly may be built of wood, but shall in all other respects comply with the several provisions of this code relating to such structures. OTHER FRAME BUILDINGS.-But for all other buildings or structures only so much of the requirements, regulations and restrictions of this code shall apply as in the opinion of the Commissioner of Buildings having jurisdiction may be necessary for safety and health. PLUMBING AND DRAINAGE. The purpose of this section is to permit greater freedom in construction and in plumbing and drainage of buildings in the outlying and undeveloped portions of the city of New York than in those portions where a street system has been adopted by the municipality or established by law. PART XXIX. Appeals and Modifications of Law. Sec. 148. (The Board of Buildings.) Each Commissioner of Buildings shall have power, with the approval of the Board, to vary or modify any rule or regulation of the board, or the provisions of chapter 12 of the Greater New York charter, or of any existing law or ordi- nance relating to the construction, alteration or removal of any building or structure erected or to be erected within his jurisdiction, pursuant to the pro- visions of section 650 of the Greater New York charter. Sec. 149. (Board of Examiners.) APPEAL, FROM THE DECISION OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF BUILD- INGS. The Board of Examiners for the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx shall be constituted as prescribed by section 649 of the Greater New York charter. Each of said examiners shall take the usual oath of office before entering upon his duties. No member of said board shall pass upon any question in which he is pecuniarily interested.

The owner or owners of any buildings, structure or part thereof, or wall, or any platform, staging or flooring to be used for standing or seating purposes where any violation of this code shall be placed, or shall exist, and any architect, builder, plumber, carpenter or mason who may be em- ployed or assist in the commission of any such violation, and any and all per- sons who shall violate any of the provisions of this code or fail to comply therewith, or any requirement thereof, or who shall violate or fail to comply with, any order or regulation made thereunder, or who shall build in violation of any detailed statement of specifications or plans, submitted and approved there- under, or of any certificate or permit issued thereunder, shall severally, for each &quot; &quot;Useful Data 271 USEFUL DATA HEAT, WATER, HORSE POWER. A Horse Power. The equivalent of 2565 heat units per hour. A Horse Power. That necessary to evaporate 30 pounds of water per hour from 100 70 pounds pressure, feed water 100°. A Horse Power. Fifteen square feet of heating surface in a standard tubu- lar boiler is estimated as equal to one horse power. A Horse Power. Ten to twelve square feet heating surface in a stand- ard water tube boiler is estimated equal to one horse power. A Horse Power. Ten square feet heating surface in a standard fire box boiler (locomotive type) is estimated equal to one horse power. A Horse Power is estimated equal 75 to 100 square feet direct radiation. Area of a Circle. Multiply square of its diameter by .7854. Square Flue Linings, Tile, are reck- oned, outside measurements. Round Flue Linings, Tile, are reck- oned, inside measurements. Seven bricks make a superficial foot in a four-inch wall and a correspond- ing proportion according to the thick- ness of the wall. Area of Chimney should be one-sev- enth to one-tenth area of grate. One Square Foot of Grate Area will average in consumption in low pres- sure steam boilers 12 pounds of anthra- cite coal per hour. One Square Foot of Grate Area will average in consumption in high pres- sure boilers 12 pounds of anthracite coal per hour. Perfect Combustion of Coal (Car- bonic Acid) compared with imperfect combustion (Carbonic Oxide) is as 15 to 4.55 (Haswell) or practically 3 to 1. Average Consumption of fuel is 7½ pounds of coal or 15 pounds dry pine wood to evaporate one cubic foot of water. One Bushel Anthracite Coal weighs 86 pounds, at 14,500 B. T. U. per pound equals 1,247,000 B. T. U. One Bushel Bituminous Coal weighs 76 pounds, at 11,600 B. T. U. per pound equals 881,600 B. T. U. One Bushel Connellsville Coke weighs 40 pounds, at 11,600 B. T. U. per pound equals 464,000 B. T. U. 30 One Bushel Charcoal weighs pounds, at 13,930 B. T. U. per pound equals 417,600 B. T. U. Water boils in open vessel, atmos- pheric pressure, sea level, at 212°. Water boils at lesser temperature than 212° when atmospheric pressure is less, as in case of higher altitudes. The temperature of the resultant vapor or steam will be proportionately less. Water boils in vacuum at 98°. Hence resultant vapor is 98°. Water expands about one-tenth in bulk by freezing. Water expands in heating from 39° to 212°, one twenty-third or about 4 per cent. in bulk. Water has greatest density or occu- pies least space at 39° Fahrenheit. A cubic inch of water evaporated at atmospheric pressure (14.7 pounds) makes (approximately) one cubic foot of steam. A column of water 27.67 inches high has a pressure of one pound to the inch; approximately, it is estimated that every foot of water equals one- half pound pressure. Multiplying the height of a column of water in feet by .434 gives pressure in pounds per square inch. A gallon of water (U. S.) contains 231 cubic inches. A cubic foot of water weighs 62.321 pounds and equals 7.48 U. S. gallons. Ice weighs 56½ pounds per cubic foot. Water in circulation is the best known absorbent of heat, and gives out more heat in cooling through a given range of temperature than any known substance. Bodies which absorb heat best, radi- ate it best. Heat Unit, known as British Ther- mal Unit, or B. T. U., raises tempera- ture of one pound of water one degree. Heat Unit is 1° or 1/180 of the dis- tance between freezing and boiling point of water. Heat Unit. Nine hundred sixty-six heat units will evaporate one pound of water at 212° into steam. Heat Unit. A pound of anthracite coal contains 14,500 heat units. Heat Units emitted per hour by a square foot of cast-iron radiation, un- der favorable conditions, will be two for each degree of difference between the temperature of the radiator and surrounding air. Horse Power is a very elastic phrase as applied to Boilers, and quite empiri. cal. It may serve as a descriptive or comparative term, but not as express- ing any comprehensible power. A Horse Power. That power required to raise 33,000 pounds one foot per minute. &quot; &quot;296 Illuminating Signs of the license fee and the surrender of the old license, accompanied by satisfactory proof in the form of an affidavit that the illuminated sign is the same as when originally licensed and that the wiring of the same, if it be lighted by electricity, is in good condition, the City Clerk may license the sign for another year.

Specifications For the Construction of a Standard Building. REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON FIRE-RESISTIVE CONSTRUCTION. Ira H. Woolson, Chairman. T. Cairns, G. W. Cleveland, J. E. Curtis, Julius Franke, Richard L. Humphrey, R. G. D. Kohn, Robert Palm, A. G. Patton, W. Riddle, W. G. Sanderson, Walter Smed- ley, A. P. Stradling, Mason R. Strong, Henry V. Thayer, J. Foster Warner. The Committee, in its discussions of the work to be accomplished, decided to establish re- quirements of construction suited to buildings of the greatest fire-resistance; and to define a Standard Building, applicable to any Occu- pancy, leaving as much as possible the details of construction for special occupancy, and spe- cial use or hazard, to be determined by fu- ture Committees as modifications of these standard requirements. The Committee defines a Standard Building as one in which the lives of the occupants are properly safeguarded against fire and panic; so designed and equipped, that damage result- ing from exposure to fire from within or with- out, shall be reduced to a minimum; and capa- ble of sustaining a complete burnout of its contents without serious injury to its struc- tural members. This Standard Building is in- tended to meet all such requirements when subjected to any condition of contents or occu- pany, irrespective of location, or efficiency of municipal protection. The Committee is of the opinion that a building of this class should be planned, built and equipped to meet the following require- ments:- First.-All material entering into its con- struction shall be incombustible, and all struc- tural parts, such as walls, columns, floors and roofs shall be able to resist fire for at least four hours at an average temperature of 2,000 Fahr. without serious structural damage. Second.-Ample and safe means of egress shall be provided for all occupants. Third. The building shall be so constructed that a fire will be confined to the space in which it originates, and the building be pro- tected against exterior fire by approved doors and windows or other approved devices. Fourth. The building shall be equipped with such apparatus that a fire can be extinguished In its incipient stage. be In the opinion of the Committee, the estab- lishment of a typical building that may used as a model will prove of the greatest value, as it will serve as a framework for the application of the various standard forms of construction adopted by this Association, and so illustrate the use of these standards. It will tend to educate the public, as well as archi- tects, engineers, and builders, and be a very potent factor in the campaign of the Associ- ation for the education of our enormous fire losses. Height. The height from grade to roof-line, irrespective of its occupancy, shall not exceed 70 feet, unless the building be fully equipped with auto- matic sprinklers, in which case the height shall not exceed 125 feet; nor shall any Standard Building exceed a height of two and one-half times the width of the widest street upon which it is located. Area. The area within inclosing or fire walls shall not exceed 7,500 square feet, with no dimension greater than 125 ieet for a building without automatic sprinklers; or 20,000 square feet, un- restricted as to linear dimensions, for a building fully equipped with automatic sprinklers. Exits. Wherever the &quot;Exit&quot; is used in these specifications it shall be one of of the two following forms: (1) Stair Exit: That consists of the direct connection of any floor area to an approved stairway built in conformity with the specifications hereafter detail- ed, either as (a) an enclosed interior staircase, or (b) a smokeproof tower. (2) Horizontal Exit: The connection of any floor area through a fire exit par- tition, fire wall, or an open air balcony or vestibule to another floor area in the same or an adjoining building having its own independent stair exits; the other area shall be of sufficient size to contain temporarily the joint occupancy of the two areas thus joined, allowing not less than 5 square feet of unob- structed floor space per person. EXITS REQUIRED. Every floor area shall have at least two separate exits, and whenever any floor area exceeds 10,000 square feet at least one additional exit shall be pro- vided. The occupants of every floor above the first shall be provided with exits com- puted on the basis of at least 22 inches of width for every fourteen persons for stair exits, or 22 inches in width for every fifty persons for horizontal exits. At least one of the exits provided for every such floor area shall be a stair exit. No width of exit stairway or passage- way required by these rules shall be reduced at any subsequent point in the direction of exit travel. Exits shall be remote from each other, and no point of any floor area shall be more than 100 feet distant from an exit. Whenever any building is more than four stories high, and has an occupancy great- er than twenty-five people above the fourth floor, then each floor area of such building shall be connected either direct- ly to a smokeproof tower, or indirectly through a horizontal exit to such smoke- proof tower. &apos; &quot;lxiii Sec.

M. Ripley, Elec. Engineer. The oldest electric plant in the world is running every day in the Mills Build- ing, opposite the New York Stock Ex- change. The fifteenth and nineteenth dyna- mos ever made and sold by Thomas A. Edison, are belted to the same engines installed by George B. Post, Architect, in 1883. Plant later enlarged. Scores Older Than Twenty Years. In New York City there are scores of belted plants still running, over twenty years old, but these may be ex- ceptions as no record exists of all the plants installed in the early days, and thus an unknown number of them have been scrapped. An Exhaustive Investigation was therefore made of all plants in- stalled in 1900 and earlier, by one Consulting Engineers&apos; Office. The records show that of the total of thirty-four of such plants, thirty-three are still operating; the one put in the old Astor Library having been pension- ed, or preserved, for sentimental rea- sons, at the new City Library. Only one plant has had to replace apparatus. Only five had been enlarged. All other plants are same as origin- ally installed, and are aged as follows: (January 1st, 1914.) 22nd Year of Service. New York Herald. Havemeyer Building. New York Eye &amp;amp; Ear Infirmary. Jacob Ringle&apos;s Factory. 21st Year of Service. The Presbyterian Building. 20th Year of Service. St. Paul Building.

House supply-tanks must be of wood or iron or of wood lined with tinned and planished copper. 160. House tanks must be supported on iron beams. 161. The overflow pipe should discharge upon the roof, where possible, and in such cases should be brought down to within six (6) inches of the roof, or it must be trapped and discharged over an open and water-supplied sink not in the same room, not over 32 feet above the floor. In no case shall the overflow be con- nected with any part of the plumbing system. 162. Emptying pipes for such tanks must be provided, and be discharged in the manner required for overflow pipes, and may be branched into overflow pipes. Emptying pipes for tanks containing more than five hundred (500) gallons must be four (4) inches in diameter and provided with a valve of same size fitted with a wheel or lever handle. 163. Acid wastes must be &quot;B&quot; lead pipe or earthen pipe, if of lead pipe they must be at least 2 inches in diameter and if of earthen pipe at least 3 inches in diameter. They must be extended through roof for ventilation and continued down to the lowest story of building and so arranged as to discharge into a lime box and diluting sink properly trapped and vented and connected inside of house trap. If the lime box and diluting sink is not used the acid waste must be extended to an earthen house sewer or separately and independently connected to a public or private sewer in street and provided with an accessible running trap located just inside of front wall of building. All branches and joints on lead acid wastes must be made by means of burnt lead joints. If earthenware pipe is used, vertical joints must be made with a mixture of asphaltum and cement. Each length of pipe on vertical runs and on horizontal runs when above the cellar floor must be supported at each hub by proper supports. All floor drains and fixture connections must be trapped and run as direct as possible. Sewage Lifts. 164. When it is necessary to use a sump system and sewage lift to receive the discharge from the waste or soil connection of fixtures, same shall be arranged to be accessible. If discharged with compressed air it shall be connected to the house drain on the sewer side of all leader or area drain traps and fixture con- nections or may be connected to house drain on the sewer side of house trap. A separate trap and fresh air inlet must be provided on the inlet side of sump and a 4-inch pipe line continued from drain discharging into sump up to and above roof, for purposes of ventilation. Relief pipes must be provided on sewage re- ceptacles of sumps. Traps of fixtures connected to sump systems must not be vented to vent lines which are used to ventilate traps of fixtures on gravity system. Sump systems should be entirely separate both as to discharge and venting from rest of plumbing system in buildings. Oil Separators. 165. Oil separators installed in any building where volatile fluids are used, must be arranged to be readily accessible. They must not receive the discharge of any water-closet, rain leader, yard, court or area drain. 166. They must, if discharged by gravity, be connected by a Y branch fitting to the house drain behind the house trap in such a manner that will not interfere with the house drain and the rest of the plumbing and drainage system. When mechanical force is used to discharge the contents, the connection must be made by a Y branch fitting on the sewer side of house trap. 167. No separate running trap need be provided on the drain entering oil separators, but a separate fresh air inlet and vent line must be provided to keep the system of drainage controlled by the oil separator entirely separate from the rest of plumbing and drainage system. 168. The size of fresh air inlet shall be determined by the size of inlet con- nection to oil separator, which shall be considered the same as the term house drain for determining the size of all fresh air inlets, which shall conform to the same requirements as regards size and arrangement of terminals for fresh air inlets as called for in regulations. 169. Vent lines shall conform in all respects to vent lines for plumbing fixtures as regards size and arrangement. 170. Relief pipes must be provided at least 1½ inches in diameter. They may be connected to a vent line when installed as a separate system or must be carried independently above the roof. Testing the Plumbing System. 171. The entire plumbing and drainage system within the building must be tested by the plumber, in the presence of a plumbing inspector, under a water test. All pipes must remain uncovered in every part until they have successfully passed &apos; &quot;280 Legal Relations The Legal Relations of Architect, Client and Contractor Address before the New York Society of Architects by Thaddeus W. Veness, December 16th, 1913. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of The New York Society of Architects: I greatly appreciate the distinction of being permitted to address a profes- sional men&apos;s organization possessing the dignity and significance of the New York Society of Architects. I feel as well the responsibility of attempting to give a paper on a subject of such direct importance, to you, as that of the legal relations of architect, client and contractor. An architect is a public servant-his every act affects not only the convenience and comfort but the safety and very lives of third parties. The instant that an individual is involved in any relation with another, legal obligations begin. More or less definite rights recognized by the law spring up, matched by corresponding liabilities for any breach of these rights. Therefore, since the activities of the architect are so connected with the public, an elaborate system of principles gov- erning his rights, duties and liabilities has arisen, some of which are peculiar to him. You all can well perceive without explanation that my subject is fairly bound- less, involving as it does the whole field of contracts, torts, and including huge sections of other divisions of the Law. Therefore, in the short time that we have, but a few sides of the subject can be touched. The selection of phases can hardly suit all of you, for you naturally vary in what you consider important or trivial, obvious or difficult, according to the exigencies of your own past experience. I shall, with a chance of being platitudinous, first briefly discuss generally a few of the main requirements of the building contract, a few of which are peculiar to construction agreements, viz.: The rights of the architect against the contractor; the duties of the architect to the contractor; the duties of the architect, to the client; and the duties of the contractor to the owner. Then, this paper will deal Iwith the chief interrelations between architect, client and contractor. The last paragraphs will relate to the architect&apos;s right to compensation and the availability of the mechanic&apos;s lien to him. The parties to the building contract should reduce the same to writing. The reason is obvious-neither is then in a position to dispute his agreement. If the service to be rendered is to extend over one year, the agreement must be reduced to writing, or under the Statute of Frauds requiring certain contracts to be written, including this type, the contractor can escape the obligation of his promise by simply pleading the statute. This is paradoxical in a way, for the statute is there- by a means to fraud, rather than preventing it as its laudable intention. But even though the contract be reduced to writing, this is not the only sine qua non for the simple reason, that reasonable men may differ as to the meaning and intention of the same phrase. Therefore, the language should be unambiguous and certain, and as definite as the subject matter of the undertaking will permit. Every phrase should be tested by the standards of the courts, to which the unfortunate parties will too soon be required to resort, except for this precaution. For instance, such innocent-looking phrases as &amp;quot;commencement of building&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;erection of building&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;more or less&amp;quot; have given rise to litigation, and have been judicially inter- preted in this or other states. The &amp;quot;commencement of building&amp;quot; has been judicially decided to date from the beginning of excavation. &amp;quot;Erection of building&amp;quot; does not necessarily mean abso- lute completion to the last detail. The expression &amp;quot;more or less&amp;quot; means what is reasonably needed. Of course even this is not necessarily a final interpretation, for peculiar circumstances might lead to a different construction. The value of the above suggestion that the terms be definite and certain, can well be illustrated by the following case: The contract was for a residence to have parquet floors- which were to be &amp;quot;first class&amp;quot; according to the understanding. The contractor attempted to recover for the value of the floors even though spaces had opened between the blocks, he claiming that &amp;quot;first class&amp;quot; did not necessarily exclude the presence of some spaces. This litigation could have been avoided by specifying in a few words just how the blocks were to be fitted. It is better to have a contract that may be a little more detailed and cumbersome than to have one that is a delight to the lawyer in need of fees. If the contract should have contradictions or variations between different parts, the rule is that the statements in the written part govern the printed por- &quot; &quot;&apos;xvi The Architect studies the building code to protect the interests of the owner. It is even more important to study the laws and provisions affecting Surety Bonds and Liability Insurance. They are the true safeguards when things go wrong. We advise architects at any time without charge but we prefer to talk it over with you when you are preparing the specifications. Prevention pays better than cure. Arranging contractors&apos; bonds and insurance is our specialty. H. W.

Exterior enclosed fireproof stairways shall consist of a stairway completely enclosed from top to bottom by walls of fireproof material not less than eight inches thick extending from the side walk, court or yard level to the roof, and with walls extending above the roof so as to form a bulkhead. The stairway shall in all other respects conform to the requirements of this article in regard to enclosed stairways. There shall be no opening in any wall separating the exterior enclosed fireproof stairway from the building. Access shall be provided to the stairway from every floor of the building by means of an outside balcony or vestibule of steel, iron or masonry. Every such balcony or vestibule shall have an unob- structed width of at least forty-four inches and shall be provided with a fireproof floor and a railing of incombustible material not less than three feet high.

Where there is an existing window or window-opening from such interior room to an adjoining room and such window or opening is not less than ten square feet in area. 2. Where there is an existing glass sliding door or an alcove opening of sufficient size from such interior room to an adjoining room. 3. Where rooms located on the top floor open upon an air-shaft of less size than twenty square feet or closed at the top, but such rooms have sufficient light and ventilation. 4. Where owing to the size of partitions, arrangement of rooms, location of fixed closets or stairs, or the interposition of air-shafts, it is impracticable to provide a window of the required size, and a window as large as practicable is provided. In all tenement houses, whenever erected, the department charged with the enforcement of the chapter may require the walls and ceilings of every room that does not open directly on the street to the kalsomined white or painted with white paint when necessary to improve the lighting of such room and may require this to be renewed as often as may be necessary. Sec. 74. (Public Halls, Lighting of.)—In every tenement house four stories or over in height, whenever a public hall on any floor is not light enough in the day time to permit a person to read in every part thereof without the aid of artificial light, the wooden panels in the doors located at the ends of the public halls and opening into rooms shall be removed, and ground glass, or other translucent glass or wire glass panels of an aggregate area of not less than four square feet for each door shall be substituted; or in lieu of removing the panels in the doors a fixed sash window of wire glass of an area of not less than five square feet may be cut into the partitions sepa- rating the said hall from a room which opens directly upon the street or upon a yard, court, or shaft of the dimensions speci- fied in the last section; or said public hall may be lighted by a window or windows at the end thereof with the plane of the window at right angles to the axis of the said hall, said window opening upon the street or upon a yard, court, or shaft of said dimensions. In every such house where the public halls and stairs are not provided with windows opening directly to the street or yard, and such halls and stairs are, in the opinion of the department charged with the enforcement of this chapter, not sufficiently lighted, the owner of such house shall keep a proper light burning in the hallway, near the stairs, upon each floor, as may be necessary, from sunrise to sunset. Sec. 75. (New Light Shafts in Existing Buildings.)—Any shaft used or intended to be used to light or ventilate rooms used or intended to be used for living purposes, and which may be hereafter placed in a tenement house, erected prior to April tenth, nineteen hundred and one, shall not be less in area than twenty-five square feet, nor less than four feet in width in any part, and such shaft shall under no circum- stances be roofed or covered over at the top with a roof or skylight; every such shaft shall be provided at the bottom with a horizontal intake or duct, of a size not less than four square feet, and communicating directly with the street or yard, and such duct shall be so arranged as to be easily cleaned out. Sec. 76. (Public Halls.)—In every tenement house a proper per light shall be kept burning by the owner in the public hallways, near the stairs, upon the entrance floor, and upon the second floor, above the entrance floor of said house, every &quot; &quot;Building Statistics BUILDING STATISTICS NEW YORK CITY 1906-1913 NEW BUILDINGS BOROUGHS 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 1913 Manhattan Brooklyn $107,977,515 67,424,138 $72,998,750 $84,976,376 $127,615,258 $100,894,595 $98,377,459 $109,218,485 $72,622,285 65,705,885 38,079,600 58,000, 146 34,813,720 32,598,240 31,371,152 29,839,971 Bronx 28,648,030 21,271,449 21,415,160 37,163,110 46,884,055 22,536,910 33,845,325 23,226,735 Queens 13,676,484 16,471,644 12,463,179 17,780,248 16,175,938 22,837,060 18,584,558 18,031,210 Richmond 2,150,000 2,805,313 2,852,268 2,429,307 2,908,364 2,339,597 3,037,176 2,330,500 Totals $219,876,167 $179,253,041 $159,786,583 $242,988,069 $201,676,672 $178,689,266 $196,056,696 $146,050, 701 ALTERATIONS BOROUGHS 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 1911 1912 1913 5,332,544 5,886,872 1,257,495 876,400 687,692 1,580,535 250,000 430,407 6,349,323 888,095 774,971 285,779 Manhattan Brooklyn.

All structures exposed to wind shall be designed to resist a horizontal wind pressure of thirty pounds for every square foot of surface thus exposed from the ground to the top of same, including roof, in any direction. In no case shall the overturning moment due to wind pressure exceed seventy-five per centum of the moment of stability of the structure. In all structures exposed to wind, if the resisting moments of the ordinary materials of construction, such as masonry, partitions, floors and connections, are not sufficient to resist the moment of dis- tortion due to wind pressure, taken in any direction on any part of the structure, additional bracing shall be introduced sufficient to make up the difference in the moments. In calculations for wind bracing, the working stresses set forth in this code may be increased by fifty per centum. BUILDINGS UNDER 100 FEET HIGH.-In buildings under one hundred feet in height, provided the height does not exceed four times the average width of the base, the wind pressure may be disregarded. PART XXV. Plumbing and Drainage. Sec. 141. (Plumbing, Drainage and Repairs Thereto.) The drainage and plumbing of all buildings, both public and private, shall be executed in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Department of Buildings. Said rules and regulations and any change thereof shall be published in the City Record on eight successive Mondays before the same shall become operative. Repairs or alterations of such plumbing or drainage may be made without the filing and approval of drawings and descriptions in the Department of Build- ings, but such repairs or alterations shall not be construed to include cases where new vertical or horizontal lines of soil, waste, vent or leader pipes are proposed to be used. Notice of such repairs or alterations shall be given to the said department before the same are commenced in such cases as shall be prescribed by the rules and regulations of the said department, and the work shall be done in accordance with the said rules and regulations. &quot; &apos;Building Code 101 SHEDS, AREA.-Sheds of wood not over fifteen feet high, open on at least one side, with the sides and roof thereof covered with fireproof material, may also be built, but a fence shall not be used as the back or side thereof. Such sheds shall not cover an area exceeding two thousand five hundred square feet, except by permission of the Board of Buildings. FENCES.-Fences, signs or bill-boards shall not be at any point over ten feet above the adjoining ground; except that when any fence, sign or bill-board shall be constructed entirely of metal or wood covered on all sides with sheet metal, including the uprights, supports and braces for same, it shall not be at any point over eighteen feet six inches above the adjoining ground. SKY SIGNS.-Any letter, word, model, sign, device or representation in the nature of an advertisement, announcement or direction, supported or attached, wholly or in part, over or above any wall, building or structure, shall be deemed to be a &quot;sky sign.&quot; Sky signs shall be constructed entirely of metal, including the uprights, supports and braces for same, and shall not be at any point over nine feet above the front wall or cornice of the building or structure to which they are attached or by which they are supported. FENCES AND SIGNS.-All fences, signs, bill-boards and sky signs shall be erected entirely within the building line, and be properly secured, supported and braced, and shall be so constructed as not to be or become dangerous. Before the erection of any fence, sign, bill-board or sky sign shall have been commenced, a permit for the erection of the same shall be obtained from the Superintendent of Buildings having jurisdiction, as provided in part ii, section 4, of this code. Each application for the erection of any fence, sign, bill-board or sky sign shall be accompanied by a written consent of the owner or owners, or the lessee or lessees of the property upon which it is to be erected. PIAZZAS, BALCONIES.-Piazzas or balconies of wood on buildings other than frame buildings, which do not extend more than three feet above the second-story floor beams, may be erected, provided a permit from the Commis- sioner of Buildings having jurisdiction be granted therefor. In connected houses such piazzas or balconies may be built, provided the same are open on the front and have brick ends not less than eight inches thick, carried up above the roof of such piazza or balcony, and coped with stone. The roofs of all piazzas shall be covered with some fireproof material. Frame buildings already erected may have placed on any store piazzas, balconies or bay-windows of wood, the roofs of which may be covered with the same material as the roof of the main building. YARD STRUCTURES.-Exterior privies, and wood or coal houses, not ex- ceeding one hundred and fifty square feet in superficial area and eight feet high, may be built of wood, but the roofs thereof must be covered with metal, gravel or slate. Sec. 145. (Frame Buildings Damaged.) WITHIN THE FIRE LIMITS.-Every wood or frame building with a brick or other front within the fire limits, which may hereafter be damaged to an amount not greater than one-half of the value thereof exclusive of the valuation of the foundation thereof, at the time of such damage, may be repaired or rebuilt; but if such damage shall amount to more than one-half of such value thereof, exclusive of the value of the foundation, then such building shall not be repaired or rebuilt, but shall be taken down, except as provided in this code. In case the owner of the damaged building shall be dissatisfied with the decision of the Com- missioner of Buildings having jurisdiction that such building is damaged to a greater extent than one-half of its value, exclusive of the value of the foundation. then the amount and extent of such damage shall be determined upon an exam- ination of the building by one surveyor who shall be appointed by the Commis- sioner of Buildings having jurisdiction, and one surveyor who shall be appointed by the owner or owners of said premises. In case these two surveyors do not agree, they shall appoint a third surveyor to take part in such examination, and a decision of a majority of them, reduced to writing and sworn to, shall be con- clusive, and such building shall in no manner be repaired or rebuilt until after such decision shall have, been rendered. Sec. 146. (Frame Buildings, Outside of Fire Limits.) The provisions of this section shall apply to frame or other buildings here- after erected outside of the fire limits, as the same are now or may hereafter be established, in portions of the city of New York where streets are now and where they may hereafter be legally established. Three-story frame buildings may be erected to a height of forty feet, said height being taken from the curb line, &apos; &quot;268 Mensuration MENSURATION for LOTS AND AREAS.

AN ORDINANCE to amend &quot;An Ordinance regulating the placing of electric signs in The City of New York, and providing that the same shall be licensed.&quot; Be it ordained by the Board of Aldermen of The City of New York as follows: Section 1. &quot;An Ordinance regulating the placing of electric signs in The City of New York, and providing that the same shall be licensed,&quot; as amended and adopted July 9, 1912, and approved July 24, 1912, is hereby further amended to read as follows: Section 1. Any illuminated letter, word, model, sign, device or representa- tion used in the nature of an advertisement, announcement or direction, erected on any building in The City of New York, and extending beyond the building line, shall be deemed to be an illuminated sign. Sec. 2. Illuminated signs are permitted in The City of New York, and the City Clerk is empowered to issue licenses therefor under the following terms and conditions, to wit: A-Upon the payment by the applicant of an annual license fee of 10 cents for each square foot of sign space or part of square foot of such sign space displayed on such illuminated sign, to be computed and collected by the City Clerk of The City of New York. The square feet of sign space on one side of an illuminated sign, however, shall be deemed to be the entire number of square feet of sign space for the purpose of computing the license fee herein referred to and required to be paid. B-That no illuminated sign shall extend more than 8 feet from the building line in The City of New York. C-That no illuminated sign shall be less than 10 feet in the clear above the level of the sidewalk beneath such sign. D-That illuminated signs shall be constructed entirely of metal or other incombustible material, except the insulation thereof, if such sign is to be lighted by electricity, including the uprights, supports and braces for the same, and shall be properly and firmly attached to the building, and shall be so constructed as not to be or become dangerous. E-That no illuminated sign shall be so erected as to obstruct or prevent ingress to and egrees from any window or fire escape on any building in The City of New York. F-That prior to the erection of any illuminated sign in The City of New York, a license therefor must be obtained from the City Clerk, and before the issuance of any license by said City Clerk for the said illuminated sign, the appli- cant shall first file with the Superintendent of Buildings of the Borough in which the said illuminated sign is to be erected, plans and statements of the proposed illuminated sign and method of attachment of same to the building, duly verified and executed in triplicate upon appropriate blanks to be furnished by the said Superintendent of Buildings, and such structural drawings as the said Superin- tendent of Buildings may require. The applicant shall also set forth the full name, residence and business address of the owner of the building upon which the said illuminated sign is to be erected, the name and address of the party erecting the said illuminated sign, and state his authority so to do. Upon compliance by the applicant with the above conditions the Superin- tendent of Buildings is authorized to issue a certificate as approval to the suffi- ciency of the construction and method of attachment of the proposed illuminated sign to such building. All approvals of applications, plans, drawings and amend- ments thereto shall expire by limitation six months from the date of same unless a license is procured within said period. In addition, if such sign is to be lighted by electricity, a certificate must also be procured from the Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity certifying that the electric wiring and electric appli- ances of the proposed electric sign are in conformity with the rules and regulations of that Department. G-A license issued hereunder upon the expiration thereof must be renewed, if so wished, within thirty days thereafter; and upon the payment by the applicant &apos; &quot;Ventilation 293 The air in many of our school-rooms and residences during the winter months is drier than that in the driest desert. When rooms are provided with humidified air, a temperature of 65 to 68 degrees could be kept in the winter to maintain great comfort, and the pupils of the school would be clear-headed and feel well. It is reported that in one case where a humidifying system was introduced in a school, it cut down the number of cases of office discipline 80 per cent., providing what an important factor, fresh, properly conditioned air is in producing physical well-being and cheerfulness as a consequence. In this connection tests made at Lewis Institute in Chicago are noticed as evidencing the effect of humidity. In these tests it was found that with a hu- midity of 25 per cent. the pupils were alert for the first part of the first hour and then became stupid; with the humidity raised to 45 per cent. and 50 per cent. the efficiency of the pupils returned. When the humidity was raised beyond these points the pupils again became stupid and headaches developed. There is one other problem of atmospheric condition to which special refer- ence should be made. The presence of noxious fumes, and still more, the presence of fine inorganic or organic dust in the air constitutes a grave menace to health and in many processes is an important contributory cause of tuberculosis. The normal body has its &amp;quot;fighting edge&amp;quot; and can protect itself against the tubercle bacillus if given a fair chance; but the lung tissue, which is lacerated by sharp particles of granite or steel, quickly succumbs to the bacterial invader. In dusty trades like stone-cutting and cutlery working and emery grinding, 75 per cent. of all deaths among the operatives are often due to tuberculosis, against 25 per cent. for the normal adult population. In other words, three or four or five out of a thousand of these workers are sacrificed every year to the conditions under which they labor. The elimination of the dust by special hoods and fans is imperative in such industries. Too little attention has been paid in the past to the cleanliness of the air supplied to our buildings. Fresh air inlets are often located with the grossest disregard for the quality of the incoming air. It is not uncommon to see them placed on the sidewalk level, or facing a vacant piece of ground that is swept by clouds of dust, or where smoke or objectionable odors may be taken in. I know of a hospital with a fresh air intake in close proximity to the ventilating shaft from the kitchen and the laundry. In another case a school building had its fresh air intake near a bakery shop. As a consequence the air in the school-rooms was so heavy with a bake-shop smell that both teachers and pupils suffered greatly owing to the unpleasant odor. In one of the buildings of Harvard University the air inlet is placed near the main entrance where automobiles start and stop, and the odor of spent gasoline frequently permeates the building. The effect of forcing unclean air into the buildings is to nullify the result aimed at by ventilation-that is to provide a supply of pure, fresh air. Supplying buildings with unclean air may often be obviated by a judicious choice of location for the inlet duct. A change of location from near the street to some higher point, or from one side of the building to another, may greatly improve the quality of the influent air. Crowded buildings and dusty streets will often render it im- possible to secure clean air from the outdor atmosphere without resorting to arti- ficial purification. Fortunately this purification can be accomplished. Just as unclean water may be made wholesome by the employment of Na- ture&apos;s process of filtration, so can unclean air be purified by the application of another efficient process of Nature&apos;s, namely air-washing. The purifying effect upon atmospheric air of a heavy fall of rain is well-known. A shower is said to freshen the air. Not only are suspended particles removed, such as soot, dust, and bacteria, but gaseous impurities, such as acid and ammoniacal vapors are dissolved and removed, leaving the air sweet and clean. The process of air-washing consists of passing the air horizontally through a chamber in which water is falling in drops, as rain, or into which it is sprayed. The sprays are obtained by forcing the water out of perforated pipes or through nozzles placed across the ducts. The sprays intersect and are said to form a cur- tain. The object is to bring the air and water into intimate contact. Besides the washing chamber, there are heating or tempering coils in the ducts, or in a sepa- rate chamber, and devices for controlling temperature of the air; a primary object of air washing in the past having been that of conditioning the air with respect to temperature and humidity. The water used for washing is circulated by means of a pump so that it may be used over and over in the spray chamber for a consider- able time. If desired, this water may be cooled so as to reduce the temperature of the air in the summer. Several forms of air-washers on the market essentially similar in principle, but differing only in details of construction. &quot; &quot;Building Code 71 in closets shall be double, with a space of one inch between them. Horizontal hot-air pipes shall be placed six inches below the floor beams or ceiling; if the floor beams or ceiling are plastered and protected by a metal shield, then the distance shall be not less than three inches. DUCTS FOR VENTILATION.-Vent flues or ducts for the removal of foul or vitiated air in which the temperature of the air cannot exceed that of the rooms, may be constructed of iron or other incombustible material, and shall not be placed nearer than one inch to any woodwork, and no such pipe shall be used for any other purpose. VENT DUCTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.-In the support of construction of such ducts, if placed in a public school room, no wood furring or other inflammable material shall be nearer than two inches to said flues or ducts, and shall be cov- ered on all sides other than those resting against brick, terra-cotta, or other incombustible material, with metal lath plastered with at least two heavy coats of mortar, and having at least one-half inch air space between the flues or ducts and the lath and plaster. Sec. 69. (Steam and Hot Water Heating Pipes.) DISTANCE FROM WOODWORK.-Steam or hot water heating pipes shall not be placed within two inches of any timber or woodwork, unless the timber or woodwork is protected by a metal shield; then the distance shall be not less than one inch. FLOORS, CEILINGS AND PARTITIONS.-All steam or hot water heating pipes passing through floors and ceilings or lath and plastered partitions shall be protected by a metal tube one inch larger in diameter than the pipe, having a metal cap at the floors, and where they are run in a horizontal direction between a floor and ceiling, a metal shield shall be placed on the under side of the floor over them and on the sides of wood beams running parallel with said pipe. CASINGS.-All wood boxes or casings inclosing steam or hot water heating pipes and all wood covers to recesses in walls in which steam or hot water heating pipes are placed shall be lined with metal. All FIREPROOF PIPES OR DUCTS.—All pipes or ducts used to convey air warmed by steam or hot water shall be of metal or other fireproof material. steam and hot water pipe coverings shall consist of fireproof materials only. PART XI. General Construction. Sec. 70. (Ducts for Pipes.)

Sec. 71. (Studded-off Spaces.) FIRESTOP, DEAFENING.-Where walls are studded-off, the space between the inside face of the wall and the studding shall be fire-stopped with fireproof material placed on the under side of the wood beams above, for a depth of not less than four inches, and be securely supported; or the beams directly over the studded-off space shall be deafened with not less than four inches of fireproof material, which may be laid on boards cut in between the beams. Sec. 72. (Wainscoting.) PLASTERING.-When wainscoting is used, in any building hereafter erected, the surface of the wall or partition behind such wainscoating shall be plastered flush with the grounds and down to the floor line. Sec. 73. (Bay, Oriel and Show Windows.) Bay windows, oriel windows and show windows on the street front or side of any building may project not more than one foot beyond the building line and shall be constructed of such materials and in such manner as will meet with the approval of the Department of Buildings. Any such window that does not extend more than three feet above the second- story floor of any dwelling-house may be built of wood covered with metal. PART XII. Stairs and Entrance. Sec. 74. (Entrance to Basement.) OUTSIDE ENTRANCE.-Every dwelling-house arranged for or occupied by two or more families above the first story, hereafter erected, shall be provided with an entrance to the basement thereof from the outside of such building. &quot; &quot;54 Building Code Sec. 22. (Excavations.) PART V. Excavations and Foundations. KIND OF SOIL AT FOOTINGS.-All excavations for buildings shall be prop- erly guarded and protected so as to prevent the same from becoming dangerous to life or limb and shall be sheath-piled where necessary to prevent the adjoining earth from caving in, by the person or persons causing the excavations to be made. Plans filed in the department of buildings shall be accompanied by a statement of the character of the soil at the level of the footings. EXCAVATION OVER TEN FEET DEEP.-Whenever an excavation of either earth or rock for building or other purposes shall be intended to be, or shall be carried to the depth of more than ten feet below the curb, the person or persons causing such excavation to be made shall at all times, from the com- mencement until the completion thereof, if afforded the necessary license to enter upon the adjoining land, and not otherwise, at his or their own expense, preserve any adjoining or contiguous wall or walls, structure or structures from injury, and support the same by proper foundations, so that the said wall or walls, struc- ture or structures, shall be and remain practically as safe as before such exca- vation was commenced, whether the said adjoining or contiguous wall or walls, structure or structures, are down more or less than ten feet below the curb. ADJOINING OWNER.-If the necessary license is not accorded to the person or persons making such excavation, then it shall be the duty of the owner refusing to grant such license to make the adjoining or contiguous wall or walls, structure or structures, safe, and support the same by proper foundations so that adjoining excavations may be made, and shall be permitted to enter upon the premises where such excavation is being made for that purpose, when necessary. EXCAVATION LESS THAN TEN FEET DEEP.-If such excavation shall not be intended to be, or shall not be, carried to a depth of more than ten feet below the curb, the owner or owners of such adjoining or contiguous wall or walls, structure or structures shall preserve the same from injury, and so support the same by proper foundations that it or they shall be and remain practically as safe as before such excavation was commenced, and shall be permitted to enter Section of Pile Steel Column.

The commission may, before making an award, require the claimant to appear be- fore an arbitration committee appointed by it and consisting of one representative of employees, one representative of em- ployers, and either a member of the com- mission or a person specially deputized by the commission to act as chairman, before which the evidence in regard to the claim shall be adduced and by which it shall be considered and reported upon. Immediately after such filing the com- mission shall send to the parties a copy of the decision. Upon a hearing pursu- ant to this section either party may pre- sent evidence and be represented by counsel. The decision of the commis- sion shall be final as to all questions of fact, and, except as provided in sec- tion twenty-three, as to all questions of law. Sec. 21. Presumptions. In any pro- ceeaing for the enforcement of a claim for compensation under this chapter, it shall be presumed in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary. 1. That the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter; 2. That sufficient notice thereof was given; 3. That the injury was not occasioned by the willful intention of the injured employee to bring about the injury or death of himself or of another; 4. That the injury did not result solely from the intoxication of the in- jured employee while on duty. Sec. 22. Modification of award. Upon its own motion or upon the application of any party in interest, on the ground of a change in conditions, the commis- sion may at any time review any award, and, on such review, may make an award ending, diminishing or in- creasing the compensation previously awarded, subject to the maximum or minimum provided in this chapter, and shall state its conclusions of fact and rulings of law, and shall immediately send to the parties a copy of the award. No such review shall affect such award as regards any moneys already paid. as Sec. 23. Appeals from the commission. An award or decision of the commission shall be final and conclusive upon all questions within its jurisdiction, against the state fund or between the parties, unless within thirty days after a copy of such award or decision has been sent to the parties, an appeal be taken to the appellate division of the supreme court of the third department. The commission may also, in its discre- tion, where the claim for compensation was not made against the state fund, on the application of either party, cer- tify to such appellate division of the supreme court, questions of law involved in its decision. Such appeals and the questions so certified shall be heard in a summary manner and shall have pre- cedence over all other civil cases in such court. The commission shall be deemed a party to every such appeal, and the attorney-general, without extra compen- sation, shall represent the commission thereon. An appeal may also be taken to the court of appeals in all cases where such an appeal would lie from a decision of an appellate division, in the same manner and subject to the same limi- tations as is now provided in civil ac- tions. Otherwise such appeals shall be subject to the law and practice appli- cable to appeals in civil actions. Upon the final determination of such an ap- peal, the commission shall make an award or decision in accordance there- with. Sec. 24. Costs and fees. If the com- mission or the court before which any proceedings for compensation or concern- ing an award of compensation have been brought, under this chapter, de- termines that such proceedings have not been so brought upon reasonable ground, it shall assess the whole cost of the proceeding upon the party who has so brought them. Claims for legal ser- vices in connection with any claim aris- ing under this chapter, and claims for services or treatment rendered or sup- plies furnished pursuant to section thir- teen of this chapter, shall not be enforc- able unless approved by the commission. If so approved, such claim or claims shall become a lien upon the compensation awarded, but shall be paid therefrom only in the manner fixed by the com- mission. Sec. 25. Compensation, how payable. Compensation under the provisions of this chapter shall be payable period- ically, in accordance with the method of payment of the wages of the employee at the time of his injury or death, and shall be so provided for in any award; but the commission may determine that all payments or payments as to any par- ticular group may be made monthly or at any other period, as it may deem ad- visable. The commission, whenever it shall so deem advisable, may commute such periodical payments to one or more lump sum payments, provided the same shall be in the interest of justice. If the award requires payment of com- pensation otherwise than from the state fund all payments as required by the award shall be made directly to the commission or to a deputy specially authorized to receive the same, and dis- bursed in accordance with the award to the persons entitled thereto. And em- ployers and insurance companies shall for such purpose be permitted, or when &quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;20 Architects-New York City Snelling &amp;amp; Metcale, 114 E. 28th st. Snooks, Jno. B.

It is competent and usual to agree that the architect shall be judge at com- pletion, as to whether the work conforms to the contract in every detail, e. g., to measure the work, to decide as to its quality, the value of extras, allowances for omissions, and that he may extend the time for completion. At the time of the inspection of the building, the contractor has a right to be present and go over the work with the architect. He may then answer objections that may be made, to which answers the architect, as a reasonable man, must give due weight. The parties may likewise decide that an oral statement, or a written certifi- cation of substantial performance given by the architect shall be prerequisite to the contractor&apos;s right against the client for payment, and that the giving or refusal of approval shall be final, and determine the rights of the parties without resort to the courts. Still it is. a settled principle that the two parties may not agree that another, or either, shall settle the rights of both with no appeal to the courts. In a certain case the architect was given power to decide to whom delays were charg- able to the exclusive of the court. That clause attempting to exclude the jurisdic- tion of the courts was held null. At first sight the above statements appear contradictory-they saying on the one hand that a term of the contract making the architect the final arbiter of dis- puted questions, etc., is legal-and on the other that the jurisdiction of the courts may not be ousted by any such provision. The harmonizing element is in the pres- ence of good faith in the architect, which brings us into the field of the duties that the architect owes the contractor. Reference to the case of Wyckoff v. Meyers, 44 N. Y. 143, will help us. In this case it was provided that the contractor should put up the buildings-three brick stores in this city-&amp;quot;in a good workmanlike and substantial manner, to the satisfaction and under the direction of the said architects, to be testified by a writing or certificate under the hands of the said architects.&amp;quot; The last installment of the payment was to be made &amp;quot;when all the work is completely finished, and cer- tified to that effect by the architects.&amp;quot; At the completion of the building, the architect gave the contractor a written certificate stating that he was entitled to his money. The certificate was to be conclusive and final between the parties. However, the owner held up $800, claiming that the building was not finished as per contract. The case came on to trial, and the defendant attempted to show only that the building was not as per contract, but the court held for the plaintiff in the following language: &amp;quot;Both parties agreed to abide by the determination of the architects. The plaintiffs were bound, as a condition precedent to final payment by the defendant, to procure the certificate, and, whenever they did get it, the de- fendant was bound to pay unless he could show that the certificate was obtained by fraud or mistake. There was no attempt to show that the certificate was not given in good faith; and it concludes the rights of the parties.&amp;quot; In other words, the court will not review the architect&apos;s fair decision if it was agreed to be final. However, the instant that fraud or error appears, the court will revise the archi- tect&apos;s decision. It may be said, that gross carelessness or neglect on the part of the architect in making out his certificate is at law at least constructively fraudu- lent, which would destroy the agreed finality of his decision. So then, a certificate given through error or fraud is worthless, and if any money has been paid through its authority, it is recoverable by the client. If the error injure either party, that party has a good cause of action against the archi- tect. The contractor gets a certificate by non-disclosure of latent defects. Later the defects appear as in the parquet floor case above. What are the rights of the parties? The owner can recover his payments under the certificate from the contractor. The architect is not liable. He cannot by reasonably close inspection discover latent defects. Suppose the contractor has placed upon my lot a building that is far from satisfactory and I object to the building but the contractor does nothing. I go in and occupy the building and make the best of it. The contractor has demanded the certificate of the architect, but upon my occupancy of the premises, claims a waiver of my right to the certificate, since I presumably am showing my approval of the structure by using it. Therefore he sues me for the contract price without the certificate, basing his suit on my waiver of it. Is there a waiver? No. The courts hold with entire reasonableness that the owner cannot be expected to go to the expense of tearing the building down, having it moved away, or to abandon his freehold, which the structure encumbers, because it is not substantially up to the contract. Therefore, there is nothing to do but to occupy the house which happens to be on my land. The contractor can recover nothing for it. This suggests a statement of the very important duties between the architect and contractor as to substantial performance. Whether there is a substantial &quot; &quot;Arbitration Law 243 Sec. 2377. Costs on vacating award. Where the court vacates an award, costs, not exceeding twenty-five dollars and disbursements, may be awarded to the prevailing party; and the payment thereof may be enforced, in like manner as the payment of costs upon a motion in an action. Sec. 2378. Judgment on award; when and how entered; costs. Upon the granting of an order, con- firming, modifying or correcting an award, judgment may be entered in con- formity therewith, as upon a referee&apos;s report in an action, except as is other- wise prescribed in this title. Costs of the application, and of the proceed- ings subsequent thereto, not exceeding twenty-five dollars and disbursements, may be awarded by the court, in its discretion. If awarded, the amount thereof must be included in the judg- ment. Sec. 2379. Judgment-roll. Immediately after entering judgment, the clerk must attach together and file the following papers, which constitute the judgment-roll: 1. The submission; the selection or appointment, if any, of an additional arbitrator, or umpire; and each writ- ten extension of the time, if any, with- in which to make the award. 2. The award. 3. Each notice, affidavit or other pa- per, used upon an application to con- firm, modify, or correct the award, and a copy of each order of the court, upon such an application. 4. A copy of the judgment. The judgment may be docketed, as if it was rendered in an action. Sec. 2380. Effect of judgment; how enforced. The judgment so entered has the same force and effect, in all respects, as, and is subject to all the provisions of law relating to, a judgment in an action; and it may be enforced, as if it had been rendered in an action in the court in which it is entered. Sec. 2381. Appeal. An appeal may be taken from an order vacating an award, or from a judgment entered upon an award, as from an order or judgment in an action. The proceedings upon such an appeal, including the judgment thereupon, and the enforcement of the judgment, are governed by the provisions of chapter twelfth of this act, as far as they are applicable. Sec. 2382. Effect of party&apos;s death, lunacy, etc.; proceedings thereupon. The death of a party to a submission, made either as prescribed in this title or otherwise, or the appointment of a committee of the person or property of such a party, as prescribed in title sixth of this chapter, operates as a revocation of the submission, if it occurs before the award is filed or delivered; but not afterwards. Where a party dies after- wards, if the submission contains a stip- ulation authorizing the entry of a judg- ment upon the award, the award may be confirmed, vacated, modified, or cor- rected, upon the application of, or upon notice to, his executor or administrator, or a temporary administrator of his es- tate; or, where it relates to real prop- erty, his heir or devisee, who has suc- ceeded to his interest in the real prop- erty. Where a committee of the prop- erty, or of the person, of a party, is ap- pointed, after the award is filed or de- livered the award may be confirmed, vacated, modified or corrected, upon the application of, or notice to, a commit- tee, of the property; but not otherwise. In a case specified in this section a judge of the court may make an order, ex- tending the time within which notice of a motion to vacate, modify, or cor- rect the award, must be served. Upon confirming an award, where a party has died since it was filed or delivered, the court must enter judgment in the name of the original party, and the proceed- ings thereupon are the same, as where a party dies after a verdict. Sec. 2383. Revocation of submission. A submission to arbitration, made either as prescribed in this title or otherwise, cannot be revoked by either party, after the allegations and proofs of the parties have been closed, and the matter finally submitted to the arbi- trators for their decision. A revocation, when allowed, must be made by an in- strument in writing, signed by the re- voking party, or his authorized agent, and delivered to the arbitrators, or one of them; and it is not necessary, in any case, that the instrument of revocation should be under seal. Any party to a submission may thus revoke it; whether he is a sole party to the controversy, or one of two or more parties on the same side. Sec. 2384. Liability of party who re- vokes. Where a party expressly revokes a submission, made either as prescribed in this title or otherwise, any other party to the submission may maintain an action against him, and also against his sureties, if any, upon the submis- sion, or any instrument collateral there- to, in which action the plaintiff may re- cover all the costs and other expenses, and all the damages, which he has in- curred in preparing for the arbitration, and in conducting the proceedings to the time of the revocation. Either of the arbitrators may recover, in an action against the revoking party, his reason- able fees and expenses. &quot; &quot;Plumbing and Drainage 125 177. Before the construction or alteration of any gas piping in any building or part of any building, a permit must be obtained from the Superintendent of Buildings.

There shall be a heavy brass straightway cock or valve on the service pipe immediately inside the front foundation wall. Iron cocks or valves are not permitted. 181. Where it is not impracticable so to do, all risers shall be left not more than five feet from front wall. 182. No pipe shall be laid so as to support any weight (except fixtures) or be subjected to any strain whatsoever. All pipe shall be properly laid and fastened to prevent becoming trapped, and shall be laid, when practicable, above timbers or beams instead of beneath them. Where running lines or branches cross beams they must do so within thirty-six inches of the end of the beams, and in no case shall the said pipes be let into the beams more than two inches in depth. Any pipe laid in a cold or damp place shall be properly dripped, protected and painted with two coats of red lead and boiled oil or tarred. 183. No gas pipe shall be laid in cement or concrete unless the pipe or chan- nel in which it is placed is well covered with tar. 184. All drops must be set plumb and securely fastened, each one having at least one solid strap. Drops and outlets less than 34 of an inch in diameter shall not be left more than one inch below plastering, centre-pieces, or woodwork. 185.

Where necessary to cut out to repair leaks or make extensions, pipe shall be again put together with right and left couplings. 187. No gasfitters&apos; cement shall be used, except in putting fixtures together. 188. All gas brackets and fixtures shall be placed so that the burners of same are not less than three feet below any ceiling or woodwork, unless the same is properly protected by a shield, in which case the distance shall not be less than eighteen inches. No swinging or folding gas brackets shall be placed against any stud partition or woodwork. No gas brackets on any lath and plaster partition or woodwork shall be less than five inches in length, measured from the burner to the plaster surface or woodwork. Gas lights placed near window curtains or any other combustible material shall be protected by a proper shield. 189. Gas outlets for burners shall not be placed under tanks, back of doors or within four feet of any meter. &quot; &quot;Building Code 55 upon the premises where such excavation is being made for that purpose, when necessary. ADJOINING PARTY WALL.-In case an adjoining party wall is intended to be used by the person or persons causing the excavation to be made, and such party wall is in good condition and sufficient for the uses of the adjoining build- ing, then and in such case the person or persons causing the excavations to be made shall, at his or their own expense, preserve such party wall from injury and support the same by proper foundations, so that said party wall shall be and remain practically as safe as before the excavation was commenced. PROTECTING ADJOINING WALLS.-If the person or persons whose duty it shall be to preserve or protect any wall or walls, structure or structures from injury shall neglect or fail so to do after having had a notice of twenty-four hours from the department of buildings, then the commissioner of buildings may enter upon the premises and employ such labor, and furnish such materials, and take such steps as, in his judgment, may be necessary to make the same safe and secure, or to prevent the same from becoming unsafe or dangerous, at the expense of the person or persons whose duty it is to keep the same safe and secure. Any party doing the said work, or any part thereof, under and by direction of the said department of buildings, may bring and maintain an action against the person or persons last herein referred to, to recover the value of the work done and materials furnished in and about the said premises, in the same manner as if he had been employed to do the said work by the said person or persons. RETAINING WALLS.-When an excavation is made on any lot, the person or persons causing such excavation to be made shall build, at his or their own cost and expense, a retaining wall to support the adjoining earth; and such re- taining wall shall be carried out to the height of the adjoining earth, and be prop- erly protected by coping. The thickness of a retaining wall at its base shall be in no case less than one-fourth of its height. Sec. 23. (Bearing Capacity of Soil.) SAFE LOADS PER FOOT.-Where no test of the sustaining power of the soil is made, different soils, excluding mud, at the bottom of the footings, shall be deemed to safely sustain the following loads to the superficial foot, namely: Soft clay, one ton per square foot; ordinary clay and sand together, in layers, wet and springy, two tons per square foot; loam, clay or fine sand, firm and dry, three tons per square foot; very firm, coarse sand, stiff gravel or hard clay, four tons per square foot, or as otherwise determined by the commissioner of build- ings having jurisdiction. TESTS-BORINGS.-Where a test is made of the sustaining power of the soil the commissioner of buildings shall be notified so that he may be present in person or by representative. The record of the test shall be filed in the department of buildings. When a doubt arises as to the safe sustaining power of the earth upon which a building is to be erected the department of buildings may order borings to be made, or direct the sustaining power of the soil to be tested by and at the expense of the owner of the proposed building. Sec. 24. (Pressure Under Footings of Foundations.) WAREHOUSES AND FACTORIES.-The pressure of loads under footings of foundations in buildings more than three (3) stories in height are to be computed as follows: For warehouses and factories they are to be full dead load and the full live load established by section 130 of this code.

The said opening shall be fitted with a tight tin or galvanized iron casing the upper end of which shall be turned under the frame. When a register box is placed in the floor over a portable furnace, the open space on all sides of the register box shall be not less than three inches. When only one register is connected with a furnace said register shall have no valve. Sec. 86. (Drying Rooms.) All walls, ceilings, and partitions inclosing drying rooms, when not made of fireproof material, shall be wire lathed and plastered, or covered with metal, tile or other hard incombustible material. Sec. 87. (Ranges and Stoves.) Where a kitchen range is placed from twelve to six inches from a wood stud partition, the said partition shall be shielded with metal from the floor to the height of not less than three feet higher than the range; if the range is within six inches of the partition, then the studs shall be cut away and framed three feet higher and one foot wider than the range, and filled in to the face of the other said stud partition with brick or fireproof blocks, and plastered thereon. &quot; &quot;Reinforced Concrete 129 (f) 16. Initial stress in the reinforcement due to contraction of expansion in the concrete is negligible. The bending moment of slabs uniformly loaded and simply supported shall be taken as 1/8 W1, where W-total load and 1-span. 17. The bending moments at the centre and at intermediate supports of floor slabs continuous over two or more supports shall be taken as 1/12 Wl. 18. The bending moments of slabs that are reinforced in both directions and supported on four sides and fully reinforced over the supports (the reinforcement passing into the adjoining slabs) may be taken as 1/F W1 for loads in each direction, in which F-8 when the slab under consideration is not continuous or when continuous over one support, and F--12, at both centre and supports, when the slab is continuous over both supports. The distribution of the loads shall be determined by the formula, 14 r = 14b4 in which r equals proportion of load carried by the transverse reinforcement, 1 equals length and b equals breadth of slab. 19. Simply supported beams shall be considered as simple beams with bending moments of 1/8 Wl. 20. Beams supported at one end and continuous at the other shall be con- sidered as partially restrained with a bending moment of 1/10 W1 at the centre and 1/8 W1 over intermediate support. 21. Beams supporting rectangular slabs reinforced in both directions shall be assumed to take the proportions of load as determined by the formula in Section 18. 22. The bending moments at centre and support for beams or girders con- tinuous over two or more supports shall be taken as 1/12 W1. 23. The bending moments due to other than uniformly distributed loads shall be computed according to accepted theory. 24. Where adequate bond between slab and web of beam is provided, the slab may be considered as an integral part of the beam provided its effective width shall not exceed on either side of the beam one-sixth of the span length of the beam nor be greater than six times the thickness of the slab on either side of the beam, the measurements being taken from edge of web. 25. Members of web reinforcement shall be so designed as to adequately take up all involved stresses throughout their entire length. They shall not be spaced to exceed three-fourths of the depth of the beam in that portion where the web stresses exceed the allowable value of concrete in shear. Web reinforcement, unless rigidly attached, shall be placed at right angles to the axis of the beam and carried around the extreme tension member. 26. Reinforced concrete structures shall be so designed that the stresses in the concrete and steel shall not exceed the folowing limits: Extreme fibre stress on concrete in compression. Concrete in direct compression. . . . Shearing stress in concrete when all diagonal tension is resisted by steel.

Axial compression in columns without hoops, bands or spirals, and with not less than one-half nor more than four per cent. of vertical reinforcement secured against lateral displacement by steel ties placed not farther apart than fifteen diameters of the rods nor more than twelve inches, shall not exceed 500 pounds per square inch on the concrete nor 6,000 pounds per square inch on the vertical reinforcement. 28. Axial compression in columns with not less than one per cent. of hoops or spirals spaced not farther apart than one-sixth of the diameter of the enclosed column, and in no case more than three inches, and with not less than one nor more than four per cent. of vertical reinforcement, shall not exceed 725 pounds &quot; &apos;274 Roof Trusses ROOF TRUSSES Tables for Finding Strains in Members for Roof Trusses of the Different Types and Pitches as Given Below and of Any Span. RULE. To find the strain in any member, multiply the coefficient given for that member by total dead load carried by truss (= span in feet × distance between trusses in feet X weight per square foot). If the truss is acted upon by wind forces or other unsymmetrical loading, the strains in the members must be calculated accordingly and combined with the dead load strains as found below: PITCH.

The contractor did not finish in time. He was held to pay the amount of $10 per day, as liquidated damages, not because so called in the contract, but because, as the court said, &amp;quot;what&amp;quot; the &amp;quot;damage would amount to, was, obviously enough, incapable of exact measurement.&amp;quot; He further says: think it is evident that the use of the term &apos;liquidated damages&apos; in the original contract exactly defined what the parties must fairly have intended.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I There is an old case, Thomas v. Fleury, 26 N. Y. 26, the facts of which will be briefly given you. The plaintiff was the carpentering contractor on a Brooklyn building, he to receive $11,200 for his work, payable in installments. The wor was to be finished April 1st. The masons preceding the plaintiff delayed their work greatly. The architect as authorized, ordered several extras, including bay windows, that took extra time, viz.: twenty-one days. All the installments but the last were paid without question. When the plaintiff requested his last certificate, the architect gave him a list of work to be done to complete the job. These de- tails the contractor did in their entirety. He again requested his certificate. The architect thereupon presented another list of things to be done. Again the con- tractor complied with the demand, and requested his certificate of substantial per- formance, September 1st. When the architect presented a third list, the total cost of which was $30, the contractor demurred. About October 1st, all else being complete, on the refusal of the certificate the contractor sued for the last install- ment without the certificate. The defenses by the owner to payment were: First, that there was not a performance of the contract as the last list of things was not put in. Second, that the building was not ready April 1st, as required by the agreement. Third, that presentation of the certificate to be secured from the archi- tect, was a condition precedent to the owner&apos;s obligation to pay. It was held, however, that there was a substantial performance of the con- tract; that the last list of defects was &amp;quot;hatched up by the defendant&apos;s agent and architect after the parties had gone through the building together and the work pointed out by the architect as necessary to complete the job had been done by the plaintiff,&amp;quot; to use the court&apos;s language. It is further held, that the completion by September 1st was within a reasonable time, since the delay of the masons who preceded, and the extras required by the architect, as well as the intermittent lists of corrections, accounted for the delay beyond the contract time, the whole con- struction being under his supervision and he having paid the intermediate install- ments without question. It was held in the last place, that the presentation of the certificate was not to be required of the contractor to get his money, since the architect unreasonably and in bad faith refused it. What was further true under the facts of this case was that the alterations were so extensive, that to give a certificate that the final building was as per agreement would be practically a false- hood and therefore no certificate of conformity with the contract could be demanded. This is far from a border-line case, but it illustrates excellently both sides of the relation between architect and contractor, viz., first, the power of the architect as agent of the owner over the contractor; and second, the duties of the architect to the contractor. The architect by the contract is the agent of the owner, either general or special. The presumption is that he is a special agent, having limited powers- as such he may not act in all respects for the owner, but must consult him as to those details outside his specific authority. If he happens to be general agent, then naturally he can act independently of the owner as though building for him- self and the owner will be bound by all his acts in connection with the contract. The case of Langley v. Rouss, 85 App. Div. 27, gives the wording of a contract that was interpreted to confer such a general agency, under which the architect ordered extras independent of the owner. The agreement specified that the con- tractor should furnish materials, etc., &amp;quot;under the direction and to the satisfaction of the architect, acting for the purposes of this contract as the agent of the said owner.&amp;quot; The contractor having undertaken the contract, is subject to it in all its terms, including submission to the oversight of the architect. This agency then is the source of the architect&apos;s power over, and gives rise to certain duties to, the contractor. As such agent he may be made final arbiter in the decision of every question of whatever nature that arises. He has power to interpret the plans, to explain any ambiguities, and to require the contractor to carry them out as he reads them; to require radical alterations on discovery, e. g., of defects in the design; to order in extras. It is plain that whether a certain piece of work is an extra or not depends upon the interpretation of the contract. Was this work con- templated by the parties, when they made the agreement. If the contractor agreed to deliver a completed building at a given price, even if this item, e. g., more of some material, was not foreseen to be required by him, it will not be al- lowed for, as an extra. The architect has power as arbiter to settle questions as &quot; &quot;Building Code 105 to which the requirements of this code, or of any order or direction made pur- suant to any provisions contained in this code, shall not have been complied with.

A &quot;dwelling&quot; is any house or building or portion thereof which is occupied in whole or in part as the home, residence or sleeping-place of one or more human beings, either per- manently or transiently. are (2) Classes of dwellings. For the purposes of this act dwellings divided into the following classes: (a) &quot;private dwellings,&quot; (b) &quot;two family dwellings,&quot; and (c) &quot;multiple dwell- ings:&quot; (a) A &quot;private dwelling&quot; is a dwell- ing occupied by but one family alone. (b) A &quot;two-family dwelling&quot; is a dwelling occupied by but two families alone. (c) A &quot;multiple dwelling&quot; is a dwelling occupied otherwise than as a private dwelling or two-family dwelling. (3) Class of multiple dwellings. All multiple dwellings are dwelings and for the purposes of this act are divided into two casses, viz. Class A and Class B: Class A. Multiple dwellings of class A are dwellings which are occupied more or less permanently for residence purposes by several families and in which the rooms are occupied in apart- ments, suites or groups. This class in- cludes tenement houses, flats, apartment houses, apartment hotels, bachelor apartments, studio apartments, duplex apartments, kitchenette apartments and all other dwellings similarly occupied, Amended July 24, 1913. whether specifically enumerated herein or not. Class B. Multiple dwellings of class B are dwellings which are occupied, as a rule transiently, as the more or less temporary abiding place of individuals who are lodged, with or without meals, and in which as a rule the rooms are occupied singly. This class includes hotels, lodging houses, boarding houses, furnished room houses, lodgings, club houses, convents, asylums, hospitals, jails and all other dwellings similarly occu- pied, whether specifically enumerated herein or not. (4) Hotel. A &quot;hotel&quot; is a multiple dwelling of class B in which persons are lodged for hire, and in which there are more than fifty sleeping rooms, a public dining room for the accommodation of at least fifty guests, and a general kit- chen. (5) Family. A &quot;family&quot; is a group of persons living together whether re- lated to each other by birth or not, and may consist of one or more persons. (6) Mixed occupancу. Where a building is occupied otherwise than as a dwelling and a portion thereof is oc- cupied as a dwelling by the janitor, care- taker or superintendent thereof, as in the case of an office building for ex- ample, the portion so occupied shall comply with the provisions of this act relative to dwellings. In all other cases of mixed occupancy where a building is occupied in part as a dwelling the parts so occupied shall be deemed dwelling for the purposes of this act. a (7) Yards. A &quot;rear yard&quot; is an open unoccupied space on the same lot with a dwelling, between the extreme rear line of the house and the extreme rear line of the lot. A yard between the front line of the house and the front line of the lot is a &quot;front yard.&quot; A yard between the side line of the house and the side line of the lot if it extends from the front line to the rear line of the lot is a &quot;side yard.&quot; (8) Courts. A &quot;court&quot; is an open unoccupied space, other than a yard, on the same lot with a dwelling. A court not extending to the street or front or rear yard is an inner court. A court extending to the street or front or rear yard is an outer court. (9) Corner and interior lots.

In any building, if any stairway has steps of the type known as &quot;winders,&quot; a deduction of ten per cent shall be made in counting the capacity of such stairway. 5. In any building where the stairways and stairhalls are enclosed in fire- proof partitions or where, at the time this act takes effect, the stairways and stairhalls are enclosed in partitions of brick, concrete, terra-cotta blocks or rein- forced concrete constructed in a manner heretofore approved by the Superintend- ent of Buildings of the City of New York if having jurisdiction in such city, or elsewhere in the State, in a manner conforming to the rules and regulations to be adopted by the Industrial Board under the provisions of subdivision two of sec- tion 79-b; all openings in which enclosing partitions are or shall hereafter be provided with fireproof doors, in either of such cases so many additional persons may be employed on any floor as can occupy the enclosed stair-hall or halls on that floor, allowing five square feet of unobstructed floor space per person. 6. In any building where a horizontal exit is provided on any floor such num- ber of persons may be employed on such floor as can occupy the smaller of the two spaces on such floor on either side of the fire-proof partitions or fire walls, or as can occupy the floor of an adjoining or near-by building which is connected with such floor by openings in the wall or walls between the buildings or by ex- terior balconies or bridges in addition to the occupants of such connected floor in such adjoining or near-by building, allowing five square feet of unobstructed floor space per person, provided that the partitions or walls or balconies through which the horizontal exit is provided to such other portion of the same building or to such adjoining or near-by building shall have doorways of sufficient width to allow eighteen inches in width of opening for each fifty persons or fraction thereof so permitted to be employed on such floor, in case of horizontal exits here- tofore constructed, and twenty-two inches in case of horizontal exits hereafter constructed. 7. In any building heretofore erected of fireproof construction, where any floor is subdivided by partitions of brick, terra cotta or concrete not less than four inches thick extending continuously from the fireproofing of the floor to the un- derside of the fireproofing of the floor above, with all openings protected by fire- proof doors not less than forty-four inches nor more than sixty-six inches in width, and in which all the windows on such floor and on the two floors directly underneath are fireproof windows, such number of persons may be employed on such floor as can occupy the smaller of the two spaces on either side of such par- titions, allowing five square feet of unobstructed floor space per person, provided there shall be on each side of said partitions at least one stairway conforming to the requirements for a required means of exit; and provided further that such partitions have doorways of sufficient width to allow eighteen inches in width of openings for each fifty persons or fraction thereof so permitted to occupy such floor, and that such doorways shall be kept unlocked and unobstructed during working hours. The provisions of this subdivision shall apply to any fireproof building heretofore erected which may hereafter be made to conform to the re- quirements of this section. 8. In any building the number of persons permitted to be employed on any one floor under the provisions of subdivisions one, two and three of this section may be increased fifty per centum where there is constructed, installed and main- tained throughout the building an automatic sprinkler system conforming to the requirements of section 83-b of this chapter and to the rules and regulations of the Industrial Board. 9. In any building, the number of persons who may be employed on any one floor shall in no event exceed such number as can occupy such floor, allowing thirty-six square feet of floor space per person if the building is not of fireproof construction, and thirty-two square feet of floor space per person if the building is of fireproof construction. 10. Where one floor is occupied by more than one tenant the Industrial Board shall have power to make rules and regulations prescribing how many of the per- sons allowed to occupy such floor under the provisions of this section, may occupy the space of each tenant. 11. Posting.
