(2) In making any such scheme, the Commission shall act in accordance with the principles followed by the High Court in exercising as the successors of the Court of Chancery the ordinary jurisdiction as to charities inherent in that Court; but (a) they shall not treat a proposal to carry on an elementary school as a proper mode of giving effect to the trusts of the schoolhouse unless sufficient guarantee is given for the effective continuance of the school for a period of at least five years; and (b) if they are of opinion that the use of the schoolhouse for the purpose of a public elementary school by the local education authority in accordance with this Act is the best mode of giving effect to the trusts, they may by the scheme make provision for the purpose, subject to such conditions (if any) as to payment or other matters as the Commission think just, having regard to- (i) the grants or assistance, if any, received from public funds towards the building, AS IT LEFT THE LORDS.

(2) In determining any such question or in making any such order the Com- mission shall act in accordance with the principles followed by the High Court in exercising as the successors of the Court of Chancery the ordinary juris- diction as to charities inherent in that Court, but they shall not treat a proposal to carry on an elementary school as a proper mode of giving effect to the trusts of the schoolhouse unless they are &quot; &quot;PAUPERISM. 491 Paupers and Poor Relief.-Average Number of Paupers in Receipt of Relief, and Amount Expended for the Relief of the Poor in England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland in each of 30. the undermentioned Years and Periods.

The Parliamentary Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Act of 1883 introduced large changes into the previously existing law, and enacted a Code of Regulations for the conduct of elections. There are here shewn in a concise form- 1. The principal acts which constitute offences against the election law and the penalties which they entail. 2. The regulations under which Candidates and their Agents are obliged to conduct the election. 1.-OFFENCES AT ELECTIONS. The offences are grouped under three main heads, (A) Corrupt Practices, (B) Illegal Practices, (C) Illegal Payment, Employment, or Hiring. - OFFENCES. (A) CORRUPT PRACTICES. Bribery. It is bribery to give, lend, or promise money or money&apos;s worth, in order to induce an elector to vote or abstain from voting for a particular candidate. The consequences are the same whether the payment is made directly or indirectly, and whether before, during, or after an election. It is bribery to give, offer, or promise any employment to or for a voter, or anyone connected with him, with the same object. [No person must be employed for payment at an election except by the election agent, who is strictly limited in the numbers he may engage.] Any person who gives money to be spent in bribery, or who repays it after- wards, is guilty of a corrupt practice. It is bribery to make a gift or promise to any third person in order to secure an elector&apos;s vote. It is bribery to pay the day&apos;s wages of any voter, or to give him money for railway fare, loss of time, &amp;amp;c. An employer may give his workmen or servants reasonable leave of abser ce (without deduction of pay) for the pur- pose of voting, on condition that all voters in his employment are treated alike. The elector who receives a bribe for his vote, or who bargains for a promise of employment or reward of any kind, is equally guilty of bribery, whether it is done before or after the election. Treating. The offence of treating is committed if any meat, drink, entertain- ment, or provision is corruptly paid or provided for any person at any time in order to influence him, or any third party, to vote or abstain from voting at the election, PENALTIES. To the briber or the person bribed, imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months, with or without hard labour, or a fine not exceeding £200. Deprivation of the right of being elected to Parliament, or voting, for seven years. Removal from, and disqualification for, any public office. Payment of the costs of an election enquiry in gross cases. If committed by a candidate person- ally, he loses his seat, if elected, and is disqualified for ever from repre- senting the constituency. If committed by any agent of a candidate, the election is void, and the candidate is disqualified for sitting in Parliament for the same place for seven years. The same as for bribery. &quot; &quot; JN 106. C75 1907 Cornell University Library BOUGHT WITH THE INCOME FROM THE SAGE ENDOWMENT FUND THE GIFT OF Henry W.

Ordinary facilities for special Religious Instruction. 3.-(1) If the affording of facilities under this section for the giving of religious instruction of some special character not permitted under section fourteen of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, has been made a condition of any arrangement for the use by the local education authority of the school- house of a transferred voluntary school, or of any scheme under this Part of this Act with respect thereto, or of the purchase or hire of the schoolhouse, that authority shall, notwithstanding any- thing in that section, afford those facilities by enabling children whose parents wish them to receive religious instruction of that special character to receive that instruction, on not more than two mornings a week, and the mornings fixed by the local education authority shall be the same mornings in the week for all those children, unless the authority, on account of the accommodation in the school, or the number of classes in the school, consider that the instruction cannot be efficiently given on the same mornings to all the children whose parents wish them to receive it. (2) No part of the expense of giving religious instruction of a special character under this section shall be paid by the local education authority.

Ordinary facilities for special Religious Instruction. 3.-(1) If the affording of facilities under this section for the giving of religious instruction of some special character not permitted under section fourteen of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, has been made a condition of any arrangement for the use by the local education authority of the schoolhouse of a transferred voluntary school, or of any order of the Commission under this Act with respect thereto, or of the purchase or hire of the schoolhouse, that authority shall, notwithstanding any- thing in that section, afford those facilities by enabling children whose parents wish them to receive religious instruction of that special character to receive that instruction on two mornings a week in school hours at such times as may be consistent with the proper conduct of the school and for not less than a clear half hour on each morning on which the instruction is given. (2) If the parents of a reasonable number of children attending any public elementary school require facilities for their children of the same character as those to be afforded under the foregoing provisions of this section, and in the opinion of the local education authority, those children cannot conveniently attend some other public elementary school in which facilities for religious instruction of the special character desired by the parents are afforded, the local education authority, without prejudice to any of their powers or duties under this section, shall, so far as it is in their opinion reasonably practicable to do so, afford those facilities in the school within school hours accordingly. (3) No part of the expense of giving religious instruction of a special character under this section (other than expenses involved in making the schoolhouse so far as necessary available for the purpose in the same manner as for other school purposes) shall be paid by the local education authority. &quot; &quot;520 IMPORTS AND EXPORTS (FOREIGN). 76.

The general provisions of Election law against bribery, treating, undue influence, personation, illegal practices, illegal payments, employment and hiring, apply however, to Parish Council Elections, and should be carefully studied. It is considered that some of the restrictions imposed by the Municipal Elections Act, 1884, also apply to Parish Council Elections. Among such are the following :- COMMITTEE ROOMS. One Committee Room only is allowed to be hired by a Candidate. An additional Committee Room may be hired if the number of electors is above 2,000. The following premises may not be used by a Candidate as a Committee Room :- Premises licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption on or off the premises. Premises where refreshments of any kind, whether food or drink, are ordinarily sold for consumption on the premises. Premises where any intoxicating liquor is supplied to the members of a Club, Society, or Association. The use of Public Elementary Schools as Committee Rooms is not in terms pro- hibited, as at Parliamentary Elections, but it would be highly unwise that they should be used for the purpose. EMPLOYMENT. Two persons, but not more, may be employed for payment, either as Clerks or Messengers, when the number of Electors is below 2,000. One additional person is allowed for every further 1,000 electors. or part of that number, over 2,000. Candidates who stand jointly are only allowed to hire the number of Committee Rooms and to employ the number of paid Clerks or Messengers authorised for a single Candidate. If there are only two Candidates, each may appoint one Polling Agent for each Polling Station, who may be paid or unpaid. If there are more than two Candidates, any number of them, being not less than one-third of the whole number of candidates, may appoint one Polling Agent for each Polling Station, who may be paid or unpaid. Unpaid Agents to attend the counting of votes on the Candidates&apos; behalf may also beppointed. Notice of the polling and counting Agents&apos; names and addresses must be given to the returning Officer not less than two clear days before the polling. Each must make a declaration of secrecy before a magistrate or the Returning Officer. Electors who are employed for payment may not vote. MEETINGS. The arrangements for meetings should be well considered beforehand, and the plans for engaging rooms, announcing the meetings, selecting Chairman and Speakers, &amp;amp;c., settled. All printed Bills, Notices of Meetings, &amp;amp;c., must bear the name and address of the printer and publisher at foot. THE CANVASS. If a personal Canvass of the parish is decided upon, voluntary canvassers must be obtained in sufficient numbers. PREPARATIONS FOR POLLING DAY. When the list of nominations is closed, and a poll is certain to be held, the candi- dates should send to each elector a card, entering thereon particulars of his register number, and the time and place for the polling. THE POLLING DAY. All payments for conveyance of voters being prohibited by law, reliance must be placed upon such private vehicles as may be voluntarily lent for the purpose. No vehicle or animal which is usually let for hire may be used for the conveyance of voters to or from the poll. &quot; &quot;PEERS OF IRELAND. 117 Roden, 6th E. of (cr. 1771). W. H.

Agreed to.-On Cl. 3 Lord Lansdowne moved that if the parents of a reasonable number of children required facilities. and if the children could not conveniently attend some other school in which facilities were given, the local authority should afford religious facilities in the school, within school hours.-Agreed to.-Lord St. Aldwyn moved that the owners of the school should be responsible for, and have the control of, any religious instruction, but might delegate their powers.-Agreed to, with a modification. -On Cl. 4 Lord Crewe moved to omit the amendment relating to extended facilities for special religious instruction, and to provide an alternative plan.-This proposal was rejected by 115 to 43.-On the motion that the Bill do pass, Lord Crewe summed up the changes which had taken place in the Bill, in making which he said the House had undertaken a very grave responsibility; the amendments would, he thought, not be acceptable to the House of Commons and he hoped that they might yet be reconsidered.-The Duke of Norfolk said the Catholics of the country could not accept the Bill as a settlement.-The Bp. of London accepted the principle of popular control, but said the country was not prepared to sweep away the denominational schools, and that if any attempt was made to do away with the safeguards, it would be resisted.-Lord Lansdowne said he regarded the Bill from the outset as a bad and dangerous measure, and condemned the attitude of the Govt. on religious education.-The 3rd R. was carried by 105 to 28. Dec. 6. C—Mr. Paul (L.) raised the question of the competency of the Lords to amend the Bill, which he submitted was a financial Bill.-The Speaker disallowed the objection.— Mr. Birrell moved formally that the Lords&apos; amendments be considered. He said the Govt. could not recognise the right of a hostile House of Lords to draft the Bill for them. The Bill was now neither that of the Govt. nor of the Lords; it was a miserable tertium quid which no man would father. He then referred in detail to the various alterations made by the Lords, noting in particular that the proposals to prevent the imposition of tests had been destroyed. The Lords had deliberately resolved to change the whole character of the Bill, and though he desired to speak of them with every courtesy, it was possible to be firm as well as courteous. The Govt. had made up their mind to send all the amendments back, because the destructive amendments were so numerous that to go through them all would be impossible in the time at dis- posal. He had still some hope that the Bill might be preserved; but if the Lords persisted in their amendments, it must be sacrificed. He indicated some modifications to which the Govt. might assent.-Mr. Balfour described the Govt. as desirous of preventing free discussion of the Lord&apos;s amendments, after having prevented full discussion of the Bill in the House of Commons. It was evident that they did not want to save the Bill. He went on to defend the Lords&apos; amendments in detail, to show that the changes were all for the better. The main principle of the amendments was that the parents should control the religious education of their children, which was in accordance with natural justice.-Mr. J. Redmond (N.) said the loss of the Bill would be a disaster, and he hoped the amendments would be agreed to.-Mr. Perks (L.), speaking for Nonconformists, agreed that the measure had been completely trans- formed, and that it was now a thoroughly denominational Bill. He trusted that none of the Lords&apos; alterations would be accepted. Dec. 10. Sir H. C.-Bannerman proposed that the question of agreement or disagreement with the Lords&apos; amendments to the Education Bill be put with respect to the amend- ments as a whole. He said the Govt. were not influenced by temper or by a desire to provoke a conflict with the House of Lords, but they desired not to waste a year&apos;s work, or to abandon the attempt to arrive at a solution of a difficult problem, and to leave a door open to compromise. The Bill had been altered in spirit and purpose, and was now directly opposed to that which it had been framed to effect. The Bill as drawn would have established a national system of education, while dealing generously with the sectarian schools; but the amended Bill would not do this. It would not be practicable to deal with the amendments seriatim for want of time, and the House was asked to consider them in globo, as the only way in which their cumula- tive effect could be judged. He hoped a solution of the difficulty might be found. If the amendments could be got rid of, the Govt. would take the Bill in the form in which it left the Commons as a basis and make alterations to bring it into closer harmony with the wishes of the supporters of denominational education. Mr. Balfour argued that the policy of the Lords&apos; amendments was to establish parental freedom. The procedure now proposed was a new form of gag. The amendments would not occupy a great amount of time, for the vital ones were few in number, and four days would be sufficient for them. The Govt. dared not face the debates that would arise. The course proposed was insulting to the other House, and could not be regarded as an &quot; &apos;AGRICULTURE--LIVE STOCK. 497 Agriculture.--Total Cultivated Area and Acreage under the various Classes of Crops, &amp;amp;c., in the United Kingdom in each of the undermentioned years. 40.(Compiled from various numbers of the &quot;Agricultural Returns for Great Britain and Ireland.&quot;) Cultivated Area Acreage under- Corn Crops Green Crops Clover, Sanfoin, and Grasses under rotation Permanent Pasture or Grass, not broken up in rotation, exclusive of 1889. 1893. 1897. 1901. 1904. 1905. 1906.* Acres.

The places represented have varied a great deal from time to time, according to their changing size and importance; but through all changes the principle has been maintained that every member represents the interests of some definite locality or place. The main qualification entitling a person to be registered and to vote- both in counties and boroughs is the inhabitant occupancy of a dwelling- house, on which rates are paid, for twelve months preceding July 15. In counties, the possession of freehold property is an ancient alternative qualification. Full particulars of the qualifications for voting will be found under the article &quot;Parlia- mentary Franchise.&quot; The main function of the House of Commons is one hardly recognised by common speech, but may be sufficiently described as the maintenance of the Exe- cutive Government. Without a House of Commons divided into organised parties, the carrying on of Government by the Cabinet system would be in a free country impossible. The House of Commons has also what has been called &quot;an informing function.&quot; Formerly it was accustomed to inform the Crown of the grievances and complaints of particular persons, and the Sovereign took action at the petition of Parliament. At the present time the function of Parliament is rather to inform public opinion of such grievances and com- plaints. The practice of asking questions in the House, though often carried to extreme limits, is, it cannot be doubted, a valuable safeguard against abuses of power by the Executive. It is, further, the office of the House of Commons to give expression to the real opinion of the nation on all matters which come before it. The time spent in a debate on some question of foreign policy, apparently without result, may in reality have been employed in the manner most profitable to the general good. Lastly, the House of Commons is the most important branch of the Legislature. The principal measures are generally brought forward by the Ministers of the day, but private members are equally entitled to introduce Bills, only that it is more difficult for them to carry such through. There is one important ex- ception, however, to the rule just stated. No private person can propose a Bill having for its object an increase of taxa- tion. By this rule is secured the responsi- bility of the Cabinet for the national finance; without it, the nation might be continually enlarging its expenditure, the blame for such increase attaching to separ- ate and irresponsible private members. PRIVILEGES AND SAFEGUARDS. The right of public meeting and the right to petition Parliament are important Constitutional privileges. The mainten- ance of what is called &quot;The liberty of the subject&quot; forms a valuable part of the English Constitution. Its chief safeguards, independently of the mode of making laws, are (1), the administration of justice on the trial of accused persons; (2), the general prevention of illegal imprison- ment; (3), the definition and limitation of the duties of the police. To the first category belong (a) the insti- tution of &quot;trial by jury,&quot; which secures a fair trial by twelve persons chosen at random from the body of the people, having nothing to hope or fear from the Executive; (b) the protection accorded to jurymen, by which they cannot be made civilly or criminally responsible for their verdicts; also the protection of their functions from possible encroachments by judges; (c) the independence of the judges, secured by the enactment which makes their commission &quot;during good be- haviour,&quot; and renders them irremovable, except upon a joint address from both Houses of Parliament. An example of the second class of safe- guards is the rule which secures that anyone whose liberty is restrained shall have an opportunity, under the writ of Habeas Corpus, of having the ground of his restraint judicially investigated; of being speedily brought to trial if accused, and of suffering his imprisonment at fixed places, not at the discretion of the Execu- tive. The right to claim damages in a civil action for illegal detention, and the rule that &quot;excessive bail must not be re- quired,&quot; belong to this class of safeguards. The last class is concerned with the definition and regulation of the duties of the police, especially in respect of subject- ing suspected persons to a preliminary judicial investigation. Depending, as these safeguards do, on fine distinctions as to when a &quot;warrant&quot; is necessary in bringing an accused person before justices, they cannot be here discussed: though, in concluding, we may notice the Consti- tutional principle under which “general warrants,&quot; or warrants to apprehend all persons suspected, without naming or describing any specially, or to apprehend all persons guilty of a crime therein speci- fied, are illegal, and will not, like legal war- rants, protect the officer who executes them &apos; &quot;CONSTITUENCIES AND ELECTIONS. 159 1892.

Lord L-Africa, South-TRANSVAAL AND ORANGE RIVER COLONY-continued. confidential, but it showed that the offence prevailed in the compounds. Selborne felt that it was necessary to stamp out the evil, wherever found, and the Govt. would support him.-Lord Harris assured the Govt. of the support of the mining authorities.-Lord Lansdowne also promised the Govt. support in dealing energetically with the evil. Nov. 15. Lord Elgin made a long statement as to the new Constitution in the Transvaal, and said that substantially the same Constitution would be given to the Orange River Colony. Dec. 17 C-Mr. Churchill moved that the grant of Constitutions conferring responsible government on the Transvaal and Orange River Colonies should be approved. After reviewing our relations with the colonies, he asked why should they not grant responsible government to the Orange River Colony? The old Orange Free State was a model small Republic. No Imperial interests would be endangered, for the Boers had abandoned the old ambition to create a South African Republic, and had accepted an ideal similar to the Dominion of Canada and the Commonwealth of Australia. There was no bond of love between the people who fought against us and this country; but there was an obligation of honour under the peace of Vereeniging. Absolute order reigned in the Orange River Colony, and to refuse that colony the same treatment as the Transvaal, because there was a Dutch majority, would be a fatal blunder, and a breach of the spirit of the treaty. The Constitution would take the same form as in the Transvaal. The distribution of seats had been arranged by general consent. The Second Chamber to be established would at first be nominated by the Crown, and vacancies would be filled by the Governor on the advice of his Ministers. If measures were sent up to the nominated Chamber and no agreement could be come to, both Chambers would sit and vote together, and the majority was to decide. Members would receive payment of £300 a year. There would be the same special reservations in regard to the native questions. The land settlement scheme was not to be developed further; but existing settlers might appeal to a Land Board established for five years. The war contribution would be remitted, and the guaranteed loan would be a full quittance for all claims against us. Prosperity was rapidly returning to the Orange Colony. Mr. Lyttelton (L.U.) pointed out some of the rocks upon which, he said, the Govt. were drifting, including the treatment of British Indians, the Chinese coolies, and the land settlement. The course taken by the Govt. was hazardous and dangerous. -Sir C. Dilke (L.) feared that the interests of the natives and of British Indians were quite insufficiently safeguarded.-Mr. MacNeill (N.) claimed for Ireland the same boon as was being given to the Transvaal.-Mr. Churchill disclaimed Govt. responsibility for the colour bar alluded to by Sir C. Dilke. Natives were excluded from the franchise under the Treaty of Vereeniging.-The resolution was carried nem. con. Dec. 17. L-AFRICA, S.-NATAL.-Lord Elgin stated that the Natal Govt. had resigned. The execution of 12 natives tried by court-martial had been stayed, but there was no interference with self-government. C-Mr. Churchill gave a similar statement, adding that H.M. Govt. had asked to be fully informed as to the action to be taken under martial law before it became irrevocable. No serious constitutional issue was apprehended. March 29. L-Lord Elgin announced that, having now heard the whole of the facts, H.M. Govt. recognised that the matter was one for the Natal Govt. to deal with. March 30. C-Mr. R. Macdonald (Lab.) moved the adjournment to call attention to the way in which martial law was being administered in Natal, and the imminent danger to native subjects. He contended that the proclamation of martial law throughout Natal was not justified, and that the condemned natives might have been tried in the civil courts.-Major Seely (L.) said the Govt. and Parliament had the right to intervene effectively in a matter of this kind.-Capt. K. Smith (L.) said the resolution must give offence and cause great resentment in Natal. Our fellow-subjects in Africa had a standard of honour and justice equal to our own.-Mr. J. M. Robertson (Lab.) said that we should be expected to provide troops for the Colony if there should be a native rising. The Poll Tax had caused all the trouble.-Sir G. Parker (C.) argued that the executed natives had been regularly and fairly tried.-Mr. Churchill said the policy of H.M. Govt. had been to support the Colonial Ministers. If they had been informed of all that had taken place they would not have interfered. We had a right to be consulted in regard to such events as had occurred, as if the natives had been foreigners we were responsible to their country. There were in the Colony 900,000 Zulus in Natal, and 100,000 whites, and the latter would rely for defence upon British arms in case of a rising. H.M. Govt. were now satisfied that the trial of the natives was fair. The Unionists were seeking to make party capital &quot; &quot;214 CONSTITUENCIES AND ELECTIONS. ..N. .C. 1895. J. G. S.

C.-Banner- man defended the adoption of the Bill by the Govt. From the great majority of landowners the tenants had nothing to fear; but against the minority they should be protected. The Bill was read a third time by 260 to 27. Nov. 23. L-Lord Carrington moved the 2nd R. of the Bill and explained its object. He said there was much unnecessary alarm with regard to the Bill, but it was supported by the Central Chamber of Agriculture, and he believed by the northern farmers. 70 per cent. of the farmers were in favour of the Bill. Its sole object was to make a bad landlord do, by law, what good landlords did voluntarily.-Lord Onslow (C.) maintained that the present law as it stood provided ample compensation for the outgoing tenant. -Lord St. Aldwyn said the Bill was utterly different from that which was introduced to the House of Commons, and it proposed to deprive landlords of the control of their property as in Ireland. The tenant farmer, if polled, would never support the Bill.— Lord Tweedmouth (L.) insisted that the Bill would not affect good landlords.-Read a second time. Dec. 5. In Committee on Cl. 1, Lord Knaresborough (L.U.) moved that an award should specify the amount rewarded in respect of any particular improvement.-Agreed to.-- On Cl. 3 (freedom of cropping, &amp;amp;c.), Lord Balfour (C.) moved that the system of cropping of arable land should be that &amp;quot;generally recognised in the district as good husbandry, &amp;amp;c., so as to prevent a tenant from ruining the land by eight or ten crops of corn.- Carried by 152 to 39. Dec. 13. On Report, the title of the Bill was changed to the Agricultural Holdings Bill.- On Cl. 3 (freedom of cropping and disposal of produce) an amendment by Lord Balfour to insert &amp;quot;consistent with the principle of good husbandry,&amp;quot; was carried by 85 to 22. -A motion by Lord Wemyss to omit Cl. 4 (compensation for unreasonable disturbance) was negatived by 76 to 18.-The Bill subsequently passed. (See STATUTES, post.) Dec. 19. C-Licensing Laws.-LOCAL OPTION.-Mr. L. Jones (L.) moved a resolution in favour of giving the people the power through a vote of the local electors to protect themselves against the evils of the liquor traffic.-After a general debate Sir H. C.-Bannerman expressed approval of the resolution, but as to whether the power should be given to a mere majority, whether it should be elastic and comprehensive, or whether it should be restricted to prohibition were questions to be decided hereafter. The resolution was carried by 271 to 44. LIGHT DUES BILL.-See under SHIPPING. April 10. L-Local Taxation.-Lord Denbigh (C.) called attention to the system of local taxation whereby, he argued, wealth contributed comparatively little to local charges, and by the system of compounding a large number of electors we are ignorant as to their share in the growing burdens of rates.-Lord Carrington (L.), for the Govt., said that they were pledged to consider the question at an early date and would begin with valuation. May 8. L-London.-COUNTY COUNCIL FINANCE.-Lord Camperdown (L.U.) criticised in great detail the expenditure of the Council, especially as to the river steamer service and the tramway undertakings.-Lord Welby (L.) defended the finance of the Council. -Lord Goschen (C.) held it desirable to convey a note of warning to them. July 9. C-DOCKS.-Mr. Dickinson (L.) moved a resolution that the Port and Docks of London urgently demanded attention and that they should be managed by a public authority. -Mr. Ll.-George (L.), Pres. Bd. of Trade, agreed that some new authority must be created, but said that the Govt. could do nothing in the matter this year. The reso- lution was agreed to. March 28. ELECTRIC SUPPLY.-A County Council Bill came up for 2nd R. and led to a pro- tracted debate.-Mr. F. Smith (C.) moved its rejection, saying the County Council desired to embark on a speculative enterprise.-Mr. Ll.-George (L.), Pres. Bd. of Trade, supported the Bill and its reference to a hybrid committee.-Amendment withdrawn and Bill read a second time. March 26. POLICE. In reply to questions respecting Mme. D&apos;Angely, who was charged at a London police court with wrongful behaviour in Regent Street, Sir H. C.-Bannerman said there was a general desire for a full inquiry, and it was proposed to issue a Royal Commission, giving it power to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents. May 14. Mr. Gladstone introduced a Bill for the purpose and named the Commissioners. May 21. C-Machinery Rating Bill.-A Bill to exempt removable machinery from rating came on for 2nd R. and was opposed by Mr. Runciman (L.), Secy. Local Govt. Bd., who said that in 1907 the Govt. would introduce a Bill for the rating of land values, and any uncertainties in the law could be dealt with.-Debate adjourned. May 4. &quot; &quot;224 ELECTORAL STATISTICS-continued. NUMBER OF VOTES RECORDED, 1874-1906. The following return gives, approximately, the number of votes polled in contested constituencies at the last seven General Elections. Its value for purposes of comparison is of course very much neutralised by the large number of uncontested Elections, especially in 1886, 1895, and 1900. 1874. 1880. 1885. 1886. Glad- Cons. Liberal.

C-Labour Questions-*WORKMEN&apos;S COMPENSATION BILL—-continued. withdrawn. Mr. Barnes and other Labour members urged the Govt. to strike out the special lower scale of compensation for workmen of 60 years of age as ungenerous, and injurious to the old men. June 18. On Report, Mr. Gladstone moved that an employer should not be liable for any injury that did not disable the workman, for at least one week, from earning full wages. -Agreed to.-Mr. Walsh (Lab.) moved to omit the clause which disallows compensation when the injury is caused by the workman&apos;s serious and wilful misconduct.—Mr. Gladstone agreed to exclude cases of injury resulting in death, or serious and permanent disablement.-Amendment withdrawn.-Mr. Gladstone&apos;s amendment was carried by Nov. 29. 286 to 27. The Bill was further considered and many amendments were disposed of. Dec. 4. The clauses dealing with compensation for workpeople who contract industrial diseases were considered.-Mr. Masterman (L.) moved to include any disease incidental to the employment.-This led to a long discussion, and it was ultimately withdrawn.- On Cl. 13, the question of domestic servants was discussed.-Mr. Gladstone opposed an amendment to include them in the Bill, but after some debate, Sir H. C.-Bannerman said the Govt. would not contest the matter further, but would consent to it.-The amendment was agreed to. Dec. 5. An amendment to Cl. 13 was carried, by which illegitimate children were included in the definition of &amp;quot;dependants.&amp;quot;-Various other proposals were considered, among them one by Mr. Gladstone to empower workmen who were infirm through age or suffering under some physical incapacity to contract with employers for a smaller amount of compensation than would be payable in ordinary cases.-This was opposed by the Labour members, and negatived by 211 to 133. to. Dec. 6. Mr. Gladstone moved the 3rd R. of the Bill, and reviewed its salient features - After a general discussion, the motion was agreed to. Dec. 13. L-Lord Beauchamp (L.) moved the 2nd R., which, after a short debate, was agreed Dec. 14. In Committee many amendments were discussed. Lord Ampthill moved that compensation should be disallowed if the workman had been insober or had wilfully broken any rule made for his protection.-Withdrawn.-Lord Inverclyde (L.U.) moved to omit Cl. 7 (application of the Bill to seamen).-Clause retained.-The Bill was reported to the House, and subsequently passed. Dec. 18. -- C-Land Tenure Bill.-Mr. Agar-Robartes (L.) moved the 2nd R. of a Bill to remove the capital of a tenant-farmer from liability to confiscation, and to extend the law of compensation for improvements, giving a tenant a right to claim compensation for additions to the agricultural value of the holding, and abolishing the necessity for the landlord&apos;s consent in certain cases.-Lord Helmsley (C.) moved the rejection of the Bill, contending that it would weaken the interest of landlords in their property and dis- courage the employment of capital for improvements by introducing the Irish system of dual ownership. Sir E. Strachey (L.), for the Govt., said they regarded the Bill with favour.-Mr. J. Sinclair (L.), Secy. for Scotland, said the Bill was a logical result of the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1900, and gave tenants security of tenure.-Mr. Long (C.) argued that it had not been proved that tenure was really insecure. The Bill would lead to experiments in cultivation, for which the landlords might be called upon to pay.-The amendment was negatived (332 to 77), and the 2nd R. was carried by a majority of 253.—The Bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Trade, (after closure). March 9. In the Standing Committee Cl. 5, giving compensation to tenants for disturbance and loss sustained by quitting the holding, was considered.-Mr. J. Mason (C.) moved an amendment to prevent the tenant acquiring a vested right of possession.- Mr. Agar-Robartes (L.) said the Bill ought to be in charge of the Govt.-Amendment negatived by 31 to 14.-Mr. E. Dunn (L.) moved to disallowe ontracting-out of the clause.-Carried by 32 to 13.-Other amendments were discussed. May 2. Cl. 5 was carried by 32 to 17.-Cl. 6 (limitation of time for distraint) was struck out. -On Cl. 7 (consent of landlord not to be required for certain improvements) a long discussion took place, and ultimately it was amended and agreed to.-Cl. 8 (contracts of tenancy to contain record of the condition of the holding) was discussed. May 11. Col. Long (C.) moved a new clause to give market gardeners a right to compensa- tion for certain unexhausted improvements-Agreed to.-The Bill passed through the Committee. May 14. The Bill was considered on Report.-Lord Willoughby (C.) moved that it should come into force on 7th April, 1908.-Closured and rejected by a majority of 151.—Mr. Cave (C.) moved to exempt existing tenancies from the Bill, so as to give landlords &quot; &apos;NAVY-SEAMEN, MARINES, &amp;amp;c.-FLEETS. 495 Seamen, Marines, Naval Reserves, &amp;amp;c.-Numbers provided 37. for in the Estimates for 1906-1907.

W.) is presided over by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who changes with the Government, assisted by a Parliamentary and a Permanent Under- Secretary of State, with three Assistant Under-Secretaries. All negotiations with, and despatches to and from foreign Powers pass through this Office; and all diplomatic and consular representatives abroad are appointed by, and report to, the Foreign Secretary. A very important branch of work is transacted in the Commercial Department, which collects, through our Consuls abroad, information likely to be of use to the commercial community in this country, and circulates it among Chambers of Commerce, &amp;amp;c. Commercial agents, distinct from Consuls, have been appointed in some few countries for the purpose of promoting British trade interests. FOREIGN SECRETARIES SINCE 1868. Earl of Clarendon, d.

This officer exercises all the statutory powers of supervision over the Friendly and Building Societies of the country. These powers, however, are very limited and do not make him in any way responsible for the management or solvency of any society. The Friendly Societies Acts were con- solidated in 1896. Under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act of 1897, the Registrar has the duty of certifying the soundness of societies for mutual insurance against accidents. CHIEF REGISTRAR.-J. D. Stuart Sim. HERALDS&apos; COLLEGE.-See College of Arms. HOME OFFICE (Whitehall, S. W.) is presided over by the Secretary of State for the Home Department (changing with the Ministry, but always in the House of Commons), assisted by one Permanent and one Assistant Under-Secretary, and one Parliamentary Under-Secretary. This department is charged generally with the maintenance of order and the re- pression of crime in Great Britain. It has complete control over the Metropo- litan Police (outside the City), but only certain statutory financial powers over the provincial police. It controls all prisons, whether convict prisons or those transferred from local authorities under the Prisons Act, 1877, and is in this work assisted by Boards of Visitors appointed locally. The prerogative of mercy vested in the Crown is exercised upon the advice of the Home Secretary, except as to Ireland and Scotland, where it is exercised by the Lord Lieutenant and the Secretary for Scotland respectively. The direction of Public Prosecutions is an important branch of the Home Office work, but is transacted at the Treasury by the Solicitor to that Department. Amongst other duties of the Home Office are the inspec- tion of reformatory and industrial schools, of coal and metalliferous mines, of quarries, of explosives, and of factories and work- shops. It administers the Aliens Act, the Burial Acts, the Inebriates Acts, the Vivi- section Act, the Cruelty to Animals Act, the Housing Acts (in London), and other statutes. The Home Office also prepares the Criminal and Judicial Statistics for England and Wales, and the Mineral Statistics for the United Kingdom. HOME SECRETARIES SINCE 1867. Rt. Hon. G.

Schemes with reference to Delegation. 21.-(1) The Council of every county shall, subject to the provisions of this section, within two years after the passing of this Act, prepare a scheme for the purpose of delegating throughout their county to local education committees some of their powers and duties with respect to elementary education, and shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act obtain information for the purpose of making such a scheme by public local inquiries and other means. No power of making a byelaw under section seventy-four of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, or of incurring expenses in respect of capital expenditure or rent on account of the provision or improvement of a public elementary school, and no power to engage, dismiss, or fix the salary of a teacher, or of making arrangements under this Act for the use of schoolhouses for the purpose of a public elementary school, or of affording or withdrawing facilities under this Act for the giving of religious instruction of some special character, shall be delegated under the scheme, without prejudice, however, to any power of delegation (otherwise than by scheme) under any other Act.

(4) Every scheme shall specify the constitution, and, if necessary, the mode &apos; &quot;128 HOUSE OF COMMONS-PROCEDURE. of the House to another, and must make an obeisance to the chair in passing to or from his seat. Seats may be retained for the sitting by members who have been present at prayers, but not otherwise. The front bench on the right of the chair is reserved for Ministers; that on the left is ordinarily occupied by Privy Councillors or other members who have held office. No member may pass between the chair and any member who is speaking from either of the two lower benches; nor between the chair and the table; nor may he read any newspaper, book, or letter in his place. Admission of Strangers.--Persons desirous of admi-sion to the Spe ker&apos;s, Special, or Strangers&apos; Gallery, must make application to a member, who may then apply, per- sonally or by letter, at the office of the Speaker&apos;s Secretary. A ticket of admission, bearing a number, will then be issued to the member so applying, a counterfoil being retained. On any person presenting the ticket of admission, he may be required to sign his name and write his ad Iress, which must correspond with the name and address as contained in the written application and entered on the counterfoil. Applications for admission may be made for not more than six days in advance. In cases of casual vacancies occurring during the sitting of the House, applications are to be made to the Serjeant-at-Arms in the same form as above. The Members&apos; Lobby is reserved for Peers and members only, and for some permanent officials, secretaries of Ministers, and such others as are included in a special list authorised by the Speaker. Parliamentary agents are admitted to the Members&apos; Lobby until half-past five o&apos;clock. Persons going to the offices of the House on business are admitted at all times. When the Committees are not sitting, none but persons going to the offices of the House are admitted. Whea the Committ es are sitting, persons pro- ceeding to them are only permitted to enter the Committee Rooms and offices pertaining thereto. During the sitting of the House no visitor is admitted to the central hall, unless he wishes to see a member, or has a ticket of ad- mission to one of the galleries, and no persons except those who have such tickets are permitted to go beyond the central and lower waiting halls, nor to enter the dining, tea, and smoking rooms, nor to go on the terrace, even though accompanied by a member. After 4 p.m. the subway under Bridge Street is closed to all but members. Strangers may be ordered to withdraw by vote of the House, decided without debate, or by order of the Speaker or Chairman at any time. Business of the House.--The ordinary public business of each day consists of orders of the day and notices of motion. An order of the day is a Bill, or other matter, which the House has ordered to be taken into consideration on a particular· day. Orders of the day generally take prece- dence of motions on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays; Govern- ment business having precedence at: every sitting except after 8.15 p.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday, and the sitting on Friday. After Easter, Government business has precedence on Tuesday, and after Whitsuntide, until Michaelmas, at a&apos;l ordinary sittings, and nearly all Friday sittings. After Whitsuntide, all public Bills, except those introduced by the Government, are arranged so as to give priority to those which are most advanced in their stages. Except for a money bill, no order of the day or notice of motion can be taken after eleven at night, if objection is made to its progress. 19 The House proceeds each day at after- noon sittings with, 1, Private Business; 2, Petitions; 3, Questions; 4, Matters taken at the commencement of Public Business; 5, Orders of the Day and Notices of Motion. Notices of motions take precedence of orders of the day on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings. When a motion has been made and seconded a question thereupon is proposed to the House by Mr. Speaker; if it is not seconded it drops at once. A motion once made can only be withdrawn by the unanimous leave of the House. A. question may be superseded: 1, By Adjournment or by a &amp;quot;Count out; 2, By a motion That this House- do now proceed to the Orders of the Day,&amp;quot; or That the Orders of the Day be now read;&amp;quot; 3, By Amendment. decision by the House on a question may be prevented by moving the Previous Question, i.e., &amp;quot;That that question be not now put,&amp;quot; and to this motion no amendment may be moved. If the previous question be negatived, the original question is to be put forthwith, without amendment or debate. Debate upon a question may be interrupted: 1, By a matter of privilege suddenly arising; 2, By words of heat between members; 3, By a question of order; 4, By a message from the King or Lords Commissioners; 5, By an answer to an address; 6, By a message from the Lords. A Closure. --The Closure rule adopted in March, 1887, and amended in March, 1888, is as follows:-- &amp;quot;That after a question has been proposed, a member rising in his place may claim to move, That the question + &quot; &quot;118 BISHOPS NOT HAVING SEATS IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS, BUT WHO WILL SUCCEED THERETO, ON THE OCCURRENCE OF VACANCIES, IN THE ORDER STATED.

He regarded the facilities to be given for denominational instruction as insufficient, and as endowing a form of religious teaching which was not acceptable to the very large number of parents who desired definite religious instruction. Religion ought not to be divorced from education, and a provision which would debar a child from such teaching, except when four-fifths of the parents desired it, was not worthy of Parliament.-Mr. Masterman (L.) said there was only one solution of the religious controversy: that the State should teach no form of religious belief to which any one conscientiously objected.—Mr. R. Macdonald (Lab.) said his party would vote against the clauses on religious instruction.-Dr. Macnamara (L.), on the other hand, regarded the Bill as in the main an honest, skiltul and painstaking effort to solve a very difficult problem.-Mr. Wyndham (C.) said the Bill was one for regulating and curtailing religious instruction, not for education. Hitherto the State had held the balance fairly between denominational and unde- nominational instruction; but the Govt. were seeking to subordinate the religion of individual citizens to the supposed needs of national policy.-Lord R. Cecil (C). pro- teated against the scheme as a crime against the religion of the country, and as giving no guarantee that Christianity would be taught at all.—Mr. Birrell claimed that in both the county council schools and in the transferred voluntary schools there would be full opportunity for giving children instruction in the religion of their parents.-The Bill was read a first time. April 9. Mr. Wyndham (C.) moved the rejection of the Bill. Dealing first with Part II., he condemned the proposal that the Education Board should be given power to alter the character of denominational endowments. Under Part III. heavy and increasing burdens would be put upon the rates. Part IV. of the Bill was flagrantly unjust, and put the religious liberties of minorities in Wales at the mercy of the county councils, which had always shown a most impracticable spirit. Part I. was a violation of religious equality. The State had always been, and ought to be, neutral in religious matters. In England there were 14,200 denominational schools, providing for more than half the children in the country. They were to be converted into undenomina- tional schools; the teachers not permitted to give denominational instruction, and some of them might lose their positions. A vast amount of property was affected by the Bill. By crushing out definite religious instruction the maintenance of any form of such instruction as part of the education of the English child would be imperilled. To provided schools he took great exception. The Bill would give to one party the power to ruin the other, should the latter refuse the terms proposed. The provision for a Commission of three to deal with trusts was unworkable, for trustees would defend suits brought against them throughout the length and breadth of the land, and the litigation would last years. The &amp;quot;special facilities&amp;quot; for denominational instruction in boroughs and urban districts were wholly inadequate. If the Govt. persisted with their proposals they would have to face a religious war. The Opposition would contest the Bill at every stage.-Sir H. Fowler (L.) Chan. of Duchy., denied that the Govt. desired to crush the Church of England. The fundamental prin- ciples of the Bill were public control of public money and the abolition of religious tests for teachers. To talk of robbery and confiscation was absurd. In the transferred schools there would be undenominational instruction on three or four days a week, and there might be distinctive religious teaching on two days. The Board school system had been approved by the great bulk of the population, and he hoped sincerely that a just and satisfactory settlement would be arrived at.-Mr. T. P. O&apos;Connor (N.) said that Roman Catholic feeling had never been so deeply stirred as now.-Mr. Perks (L.) said that Nonconformists were determined to prevent proselytising in Anglican schools. On clause 4 he asked the Govt. to keep an open mind. The proposed extended facilities would render clause 3 nugatory. Mr. Belloc (L.) advised, on behalf of Roman Catholics, the extension of the four-fifths facilities to small areas, the concession of denominational teaching as a right, and the right to nominate teachers.-Mr. R. Macdonald (L.) spoke against continuing religious instruc- tion in elementary schools. The Bill would perpetuate all the existing denomina- tional trouble. The State ought to confine its efforts to secular instruction. He denied that parents had a right to ask the State to teach their religion to their children. -Dr. Macnamara (L.) denied that denominational property would be confiscated, but advised the voluntary managers to deal with their adversaries quickly. Denomina- tionalism all round was impracticable, and secular teaching would not be agreeable to the national sentiment. May 7. 66 &amp;quot;&amp;quot; Mr. Ll.-George (L.), dealing first with the clause for a Welsh Education Council, said it would be a purely educational body and not a sort of independent Parliament, Passing to the religious question, he asserted that a purely secular system was impossible, &quot; &quot;448 LIST OF BOOKS.

To limit the hours of work below ground in coal mines.-Mr. J. F. L. Brunner (L.). [The Bill varied from its predecessors in one particular, in that it proposed that the hours of labour should be gradually reduced-to 9 next year, to 8 in 1908, and to 8 in 1909. On second reading the Home Secretary, Mr. H. J. Gladstone (R.), said the Government would agree to the question being referred to a departmental committee for consideration.] CORONERS BILL (100).

Distance from School no excuse for Non- attendance when Conveyance is provided. 33.(1) When a local education authority provide means of conveyance for a child between a reasonable distance of its home and a public elementary school, it shall not be a reasonable excuse for the purpose of section seventy-four of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, or section eleven of the Elementary Education Act, 1876, or a ground of exemption for the purposes of section nine of the latter Act, that there is no public elementary school open which such child can attend within the distance of its residence prescribed by those sections or by any byelaw made under section seventy-four of the Elementary Educa- tion Act, 1870. (2) For the purposes of paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section eighteen of the Education Act, 1902, the county council may treat any expenses incurred by them in providing means of convey- ance for teachers or children attending a public elementary school under sub- section (1) of section twenty-three of the Education Act, 1902, in the same manner as they may treat the capital expenditure mentioned in the said paragraph (c).

An Act to amend the law relating to agricultural holdings. The law regulating compensation for improvements is altered by this Act in the tenant&apos;s favour by enabling him to claim compensation on quitting his holding for improvements, on the basis of the value of the same to the incoming tenant (section 1). A single arbitrator is to determine all questions, and may be required to specify the amount awarded in respect of each particular matter. Compensation is to be given under section 2 for damage by game according to defined procedure. Section 3 permits to the tenant freedom of cropping and disposal of produce, pro- vided that he makes suitable provision for preventing deterioration of the land.

Section 2 provides for the recovery from the parents of the cost of meals furnished to a child, unless he is unable to pay. The authority is empowered by section 3 to defray the cost of food in certain cases (which are strictly defined) where the children are unable from lack of food to take full advantage of the school, and there are no sufficient local funds to provide food. Such power is only to be exercised with the sanction of the Board of Education.-21st December.

AS IT LEFT THE COMMONS. special circumstances of the case the Board think it expedient, they may, instead of making such an arrangement, make an order allowing the school to continue as a state-aided school. Pro- vided that- (a) an order shall not be made under this provision unless the school- house is, in the opinion of the Board of Education, structurally suitable; and (b) an arrangement made by order for the use of a schoolhouse under this provision shall not have effect for more than five years. (2) It shall be the duty of the local education authority to comply with any condition contained in any arrangement made by an order under this section. (3) An appeal under this section shall not be entertained unless it is made before the first day of January nineteen hun- dred and eight. (4) The parents of at least twenty children attending a transferred volun- tary school, if aggrieved by the mode in which extended facilities are afforded by a local education authority, may appeal to the Board of Education, and that Board, if satisfied, after considering the circumstances of the case, that there are reasonable grounds for the appeal, may make an order allowing the school to continue as a state-aided school, and providing so far as necessary for the cancelling of any arrangement made with respect to the transfer or use of the schoolhouse and for any other matter for which provision is required in con- nection with the order. (5) Where an order is made under this section allowing a school to continue as a state-aided school, the Board of Educa- tion may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, pay to that school the parlia- mentary grants which would be payable in respect of the school or the scholars in the school if it was a public elementary school, so long as the Board are satisfied that the regulations contained in para- graphs one, two, and three of section seven of the Elementary Education Act, 1870 (a copy of which shall be conspicu- ously put up in the school), and such other conditions as they prescribe as con- ditions for the payment of the grant, are complied with in the case of the school. A state-aided school shall not be treated as a public elementary school except for the purpose of the Elementary School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1898, and any other purpose which may be prescribed by the Board of Education, AS IT LEFT THE LORDS. order, and to afford the facilities desired in accordance with this Act. (2) The certificate of the Board of Education as to the result of a ballot taken with respect to the wishes of parents, or as to whether a schoolhouse is structurally suitable or not, or whether any condition prescribed in section four of this Act as to public school accommo- dation is satisfied, shall be treated as conclusive by the Commission. General Provisions as to Schemes and Orders of the Commission. 12. (1) A scheme or order made by the Commission shall have effect as if enacted by this Act, provided that- (a) a scheme made by the Commission may be altered by a scheme made by the Board of Education in the same manner and subject to the same provisions as a scheme made by the Board in pursuance of their powers under the Charitable Trusts Acts, 1853 to 1894; and (b) an order made by the Commission may be varied or cancelled by agreement between the local education authority and the owners of the schoolhouse at any time, and by the Board of Educa- tion at any time after the expira- tion of five years from the date of the commencement of the original order, on any application made for the purpose by the authority or the owners, but after the first application no further application in respect of any order shall be entertained by the Board unless a period of at least one year has elapsed since the date of the decision of the Board on the last application under this provision in respect of that order. The Board of Education, in considering any application for the varying or cancelling of an order shall be subject to the same provisions as those to which the Commission are subject under this Act in making the original order and shall have the same powers, including power to give leave to appeal. When an application for the varying or cancelling of an order under which extended facilities are given is made by a local education authority, that authority shall, if required by the Board of Education for the purpose of their decision on the application, hold a ballot in accordance with this Act as to the wishes of the parents with respect to extended facilities, &quot; &quot;352 VOTES IN DIVISIONS-SESSIONS 1906. *LYTTELTON, RT.

Party, as a protest against what they described as a waste of time.-The amendment was negatived by 258 to 3, and the 3rd R. was agreed to. June 13. L--Lord Ripon (L.) moved the 2nd R.-Lord St. Aldwyn (C.) criticised the action of the Govt. in regard to the income-tax, and condemned the abolition of the coal duty. -Lord Goschen (C.) warned the Govt. that there might be a frightful disaster if they were not prepared adequately in a military and naval sense. The nation which was able to strike first and hardest was most likely to succeed. There was no wide scope for economy in this direction.-Lord Ripon said that as to Army expenditure, no change would be made except after great consideration.—The 2nd R. was agreed to, and the Bill passed through all the remaining stages, and subsequently became law. June 21. (See STATUTES, post.) C-FINANCE.-WAR EXPENDITURE.-Mr. Vivian (Lab.) moved a resolution that the growth of expenditure on armaments was excessive, and calling on the Govt. to reduce it, and to press for the inclusion of the general question in the agenda of the Hague Conference. Mr. Bellairs (L.) moved an amendment setting forth the necessity of maintaining British naval supremacy, and deprecating Govt. initiative on the question of foreign armaments.-Mr. J. M. Robertson (Lab.) described the perpetual increase of armaments as &amp;quot;insane militarism.&amp;quot;-Mr. A. Balfour asked if we should have been mo:e likely to settle peacefully the difficulty with Turkey if our Fleet and Army had been less rowerful. If our military and naval expenditure had grown it was held to be necessaly for the defence of the Empire. He hoped the Empire would be strengthened and consol.. dated rather than extended. We had to maintain an adequate army for home defence and for the defence of the N.-W. frontier of India as well as a Fleet which would absolutely secure us against any possible combination. In this there was nothing aggressive, but only defensive. The fleets of other countries were not main- tained for defensive purposes alone, and it was for them to begin disarming. It was not for us to plunge into a reckless course of diminishing the armaments upon which our security ultimately depended.-Sir E. Grey (L.) did not quarrel with Mr. Balfour&apos;s abstract declaration, but he held that in our national expenditure we had reached a turning point, and there was a fair prospect that it could be reduced considerably with- out endangering safety. There was also a strong feeling abroad as to the enormous burden of expenditure, which was tending strongly towards peace. The reduction of expenditure might properly be discussed at the Hague Conference.-The amendment was withdrawn and the resolution agreed to. May 9. L-Lord Avebury (L.U.) asked what steps had been taken to carry out the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion for a reduction of armaments.-Lord Fitzmaurice said the Govt. hoped next year to propose some reduction of expenditure in the direction aimed at by Lord Avebury, but there was a difficulty in finding a unit of disarmament in cor- sidering the general question and a tribunal to decide how it should be applied by all the Powers. England was not an aggressive nation; and they hoped that by setting the example of a reduced expenditure Europe would be induced to follow their example, -Lord Lansdowne (L.U.) asked to what direction they could look for a reductior. He hoped that the aspirations of the Prime Minister would be realised, but he objected. however, to any compact which would bind this country to reduce her military and naval preparation. The Navy was so essential to the life of the country that they must guard their freedom.-Lord Ripon (L.) declared that the Govt. would not adopt any policy which would in any way weaken our security. He May 25. L-Fiscal Policy. The Duke of Devonshire (L. U.), in moving for a return of imports and exports, criticised the attitude of the Opposition leaders on tariff reform. said the unity of the Unionist party had been fundamentally altered, and it had been weakened upon many questions, including, for instance, education and Home Rule, and it would be weaker still if it was committed to a policy of protection. The corres- pondence which had recently been published between Mr. Balfour and Mr. Chamberlain showed a great advance on the part of the former towards a duty on raw materials and foodstuffs. If that were so the policy was one which he was not prepared to accept, though it would be long before practical effect could be given to the declarations of Mr. Balfour and Mr. Chamberlain.--Lord Lansdowne (L.U.) agreed that trade was prosperous, but not that it was in a perfectly satisfactory condition, in view of the large number of unemployed, and that 12 or 13 millions were, according to the Prime Minister, on the verge of hunger. No Govt. would retain the confidence of the country unless they used all their power to obtain fair treatment for our trade, fight for it if refused, and also give a respectful hearing to their Colonies with the view of drawing them closer. As to the taxation of food, the proposals of Mr. Chamberlain would not &quot; &quot;136 HOUSE OF COMMONS. Cave, G., K.C. (Surrey, Kingston); b. 1856; Chn.

W.).—The cate-General, or Judge-Martial of his Majesty&apos;s Forces,&amp;quot; as he was officially de- signated, was usually, up to 1892, a mem- ber of the House of Commons, changing with the Ministry. He submitted the proceedings of General Courts-Martial at home directly to the Sovereign (being for that purpose always a Privy Councillor) and was the legal adviser of the War Office and the military authorities in all matters not falling within the province of their solicitor. The salary of the office, formerly £2,000 a year, was reduced in 1888 and subsequently abolished, the office being made non-political and con- ferred upon one of H. M. Judges. It was decided in 1905 to appoint to the post, by Letters Patent, a legal officer, who is a salaried Civil servant, and gives his whole time to the work of the Department. The principal duty consists in revising the judgments of Army Courts-Martial and advising the Secretary of State as to their legality. He is assisted by a per- manent Legal Deputy and two Military Deputy Judge-Advocates. JUDGE ADVOCATE-GENERAL.- T. Milvain, K.C.

TREASURY, THE (Whitehall). &amp;quot;The Commissioners for executing the offices of Treasurer of the Exchequer of Great Britain and Lord High Treasurer of Ireland&amp;quot; are a body comprising the First Lord of the Treasury, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and three members of the Government, usually called Lords of the Treasury, all changing with the Ministry. The Treasury is the highest financial Department of the State. It is charged with the preparation of all financial measures, and the provision of money to meet the requirements of the Imperial service throughout the world. It is entrusted, in the interest of sound finance, with a power of check over the public expenditure, and its assent is, for that object, required for all measures increasing, or tending to increase, the public expenditure. This power of check has from time immemorial been given to the Treasury, and it is in the possession of this power that the Chancellor of the Exchequer differs generally from foreign Ministers of Finance. The Board very seldom meets, and the real work of the Treasury is done by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who introduces the Budget, and exercises a supreme supervision over questions affecting the public Revenue and Expenditure; but for the details the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, with his colleagues, the Permanent Secretaries, are responsible. These officers practically control the financial affairs of the country, with the occasional assistance of one or other of the Lords. The First Lord is usually the Prime Minister, but in recent years the custom has been frequently departed from. Unless he is also Chan- cellor of the Exchequer he does not ordinarily take much part in the manage- ment of the department, of which, how- ever, he is the supreme head. He acts rather as final arbiter between the different Departments of the Government, and is occupied chiefly in the direction of the general policy of the Government, and in exercising the large and varied powers of patronage which are vested in the office. The Parliamentary or Patronage Secretary to the Treasury, with two of the Lords, and sometimes the Paymaster-General, Vice-Chamberlain, Treasurer,or Comptrol- ler of the Household, act as whips&amp;quot; of the Party in office, and manage its affairs in and out of Parliament. 66 The Financial Secretary, besides his business at the office, is also responsible for the arrangement of the business of the House of Commons. The Treasury controls the Revenue departments, and is responsible for them to Parliament (the Post Office excepted, when represented by a Minister in the House of Commons). The control of the Treasury over expen- diture in Ireland is represented by the Treasury Remembrancer at Dublin Castle, and in Scotland by the King&apos;s and Lord Treasurer&apos;s Remembrancer (Exchequer Office, Edinburgh). The Solicitor to the Treasury has the direction, under the Home Secretary, of Government prosecutions, and acts as Public Prosecutor, as Crown Nominee for intestates&apos; estates, as King&apos;s Proctor in the Divorce Court, and legal adviser to the Treasury and other Departments.

The alternative would be their incorporation, and this might have injurious results. The present law, as interpreted by the Courts, cut at the very root of the right of combination, and an amendment of the law of conspiracy was necessary to restore to trade unions the security which they were intended to have. The fourth clause, dealing with the question of agency, would be left to the decision of the House, as it was one which ought not to be pressed against the opinion of the trade unions.-Mr. Bowles (C.) said that the unions repre- sented only one-seventh of the working-class population, and the interests of the remainder ought to be considered.-Mr. Shackleton (Lab.) denied that peaceful picketing would lead to outrage, and argued that unionists would remain under the common law of nuisance. The immunity of union funds was essential.-Mr. Salter (C.) said the Bill would facilitate strikes and legalize boycotting and intimidation. It created a privileged class.—Mr. A. Balfour said the Govt. had abandoned their Bill at the dictation of the Labour members, a procedure unexampled in Parliamentary history. This was class legislation, and he regretted that they had not shown more courage. While recognising the wisdom and moderation with which trades disputes had been conducted, the unions should not be privileged, but they should be on a footing of equality with comparable institutions. Beyond that Parliament ought not to go.-- Mr. Isaacs (L.) contended that trade unions might be trusted to act in the future as well as they had acted hitherto.-The 2nd R. was agreed to. April 25. In Committee on Cl. 1 (an act done in combination by two or more persons shall, if done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, not be actionable unless it would be actionable if done by one person). Several amendments were moved by Unionist members and rejected on divisions, this clause being finally carried by 313 to 33.-On Cl. 2 (legalizing &quot; peaceful picketing &quot;), Mr. Bowles moved to limit the right to three persons at most.-Sir L. Walton moved the closure, which was carried by 319 to 49, and the amendment was negatived.-Clause agreed to. 66 July 27. Cl. 2, which proposes to legalize picketing carried on peaceably and in a reasonable manner, was resumed, and the closure was applied repeatedly.-Sir C. Dilke (L.) moved to strike out the words &quot;peaceably and in a reasonable manner.&quot;-Rejected by 140 to 91.-He then moved that persons engaged in peaceful picketing should not be amenable to the common law of nuisance.-For the amendment 122, against 127.- Cl. 2 was carried, after closure, by 238 to 31.-On Cl. 3 (an act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute not to be actionable as a tort on the ground only that it is an interference with the trade, business, or employment of some other person, etc.)-Sir F. Banbury (C.) moved that the law of tort should apply when the interference was malicious.-Negatived by 257 to 30.-An amendment by Sir C. Dilke that the act should not be actionable merely because it induced a person to break a contract was carried by a majority of over 200.-Sir E. Carson said the Govt. hardly realised what they were doing. The clause would sanction conspiracies to induce people to break their contracts.-The question of the immunity of trade union funds when tortious acts are committed was then discussed.-Sir L. Walton moved to postpone Cl. 4 in order to propose a new clause for the prohibition of actions against unions, whether of workmen or masters, for the recovery of damages in respect of tortious acts.-Mr. Balfour charged the Govt. with having, in this, surrendered to the Labour members; Sir L. Walton had previously defended the provision which he was now abandoning. They were now asked to give protection to trade union funds used for fighting purposes, and to enact that unions should not be responsible for injuries inflicted through their agents. Capitalist and labour organizations ought not to be given power which might be abused hereafter.-Mr. Asquith said that the law could not be allowed to remain where it was left by the Taff Vale and other decisions. He still thought the best way of meeting the difficulty would be to amend the law of agency instead of exempting the funds from liability. He would never have consented to the latter unless the immunity were extended to the employers. The new clause was bilateral, and was acceptable to the vast majority of the persons concerned. There was no danger that the privilege would be abused, and when trade unions abused their powers Parliament could interfere.—The motion to postpone the clause was carried by 246 to 22.-Sir L. Walton then brought forward his new clause, and justified the change in the Bill, which was denounced by Sir E. Carson, who declared that the trade funds, apart from their charitable funds, had no just claim to exceptional legal treatment.The clause was read a second time by 257 to 29. Aug. 3. On the Report stage, new clauses were considered. Mr. S. Roberts (C.) moved one making trade unions pecuniarily responsible for wrongs done by their authorized agents.--Mr. Asquith justified his change of view, as the question was one of expediency and method rather than of principle. He only — &apos; &quot;PARLIAMENTARY SUMMARY, 1906. 313 C-Education-*EDUCATION BILL-continued. olive branch. He strongly condemned the precedent which was being set.-Mr. Asquith said the amendments together amounted to a new personality. The Govt., he declared, did not want to kill the Bill, because, as it left the Commons, it would supply a basis for a settlement of the religious controversy, and because it was urgently needed, not merely to soothe the conscience of the passive resister, but to maintain the interests of the voluntary schools. The discussion could not have been confined to four days. -An amendment by Lord R. Cecil having been negatived by 306 to 104, Mr. C. J. O&apos;Donnell (L.) moved that Cl. 4 should have separate treatment.-Mr. Birrell resisted the demand, but was willing to strengthen the clause.-Amendment negatived.- Mr. Healy (N.) said the Govt. were playing a wrong card, and the Lords would be in a position to euchre them.-The resolution was carried by 317 to 89.-Mr. Lough then moved that the Lords&apos; amendments be disagreed with. Dec. 11. Dr. Macnamara (L.) hoped the Bill might be saved, as there were many good points in it for which he was prepared to pay a long price.-Mr. Dillon separated his party from the Duke of Norfolk&apos;s action in voting against the measure.-Lord R. Cecil argued that the Lords&apos; amendments would secure to every child the opportunity of some religious teaching.-Mr. Wyndham (C.) said that peace was not likely if the amendments were sent back in globo.-Mr. Birrell assured the House that the Govt. did not desire to be offensive to the Lords. It was as respectful to negative the amend- ments en bloc as seriatim. He questioned the right of every parent to have his child taught his religion. As to Cl. 4, he was anxious to make it frankly denominational. and he believed that he Bill could be saved by mutual concessions affecting that clause and the posiiton of teachers under Cl. 3.-Mr. Balfour said it was evident that the Govt. desired to kill the Bill by sending it back to the Lords with a challenge. If it were lost the responsibility would rest with them.-The motion to disagree with the Lords&apos; amendments was carried by 416 to 107. Dec. 12. L-On the motion to consider the Commons&apos; message disagreeing en bloc with the Lords&apos; amendments, Lord Lansdowne said the message was entirely unprecedented as it was that the Commons disagreed with all their amendments entirely, many of which had been moved by the Govt. He then, again, justified the changes made by the Lords as being in accordance with the expressed views of the Govt. He did not think they could take this treatment lying down; it had the appearance of grave dis- respect. He invited the Govt. to state what proposals they had to make to save the Bill. He moved that the House protested against the innovation in constitutional procedure by which the Commons had rejected the whole of the Lords&apos; amendments without giving any specific reasons, and adjourned the consideration of the matter to allow the Govt. to make a definite statement as to each material amendment.- Lord Crewe defended the constitutional attitude of the House of Commons. The amendments had reversed the whole principle of the Bill. As to the suggested adjour- ment, he should not be able to make any different statement. The main principles of the Bill could not be altered by the Govt. ; but there were points on which there might be a compromise, which he named. Dec. 17. Lord Ripon protested against the amendment, denying that the course pursued by the Commons was an innovation.-Lord Lansdowne&apos;s amendment was carried by 138 to 52.-Lord Lansdowne then moved that the House do insist on its amend- ments. He said that the amendments proposed by Lord Crewe being the ultimatum of the Govt., left the Bill in a shape which the Lords could not possibly accept. The position of the teachers was the key of the position, and they insisted that full freedom should be given to them. Cls. 3 and 4 were altogether inadequate, as the local authority could forbid any teachers from giving any religious instruction. The Bill as amended by the Lords gave full popular control, gave no religious education at the public cost, and made Cowper-Temple teaching available to children in all schools.-Lord Crewe replied that the Govt. had made many con- cessions, especially as regards the teachers, but to ask a Liberal Govt. to vote money for purely denominational schools would be a mockery and a farce. He doubted whether such concessions would ever be offered again. These special proposals were gone, and as to the reappearance of any of them he could say nothing. Their task was simply to administer. He refused one iota of responsibility for the rejection of the Bill. The Abp. of Canterbury expressed his intense disappointment that the strife should go on, but there was nothing to be gained by removing one grievance and imposing a greater grievance. The Bill was so marred that it could be no reason- able settlement. He asked for no privilege or advantage for one denomination over another, but only that equal opportunities should be open to all. He denied that the Lords&apos; amendments were of a wrecking character.-The Duke of Devonshire said he disagreed with the view that a compromise was impossible, and would have been &quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;172 CONSTITUENCIES AND ELECTIONS.

CHARITY COMMISSION-cont. superintended by a Chief Commissioner, a permanent official appointed by the First Lord of the Treasury, assisted by three other commissioners, one of whom is a member of the House of Commons, and represents the Commission in Parliament. Their duties are to superintend the preparation of schemes for the general administration of charities, and also of Endowed Schools and the City of London Charities, under special Acts of Parlia- ment. Under the Board of Education Act, 1899, some of the duties of the Commission in regard to educational charities have been transferred to that Board. COMMISSIONERS-C. A. Cook (Chief); D. R. Fearon, C.B. (Second); A. F. Leach (Third); C. P. Trevelyan, M.P. (Fourth, unpaid). SECRETARY-R. Durnford. CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION (Burlington Gardens, W.) is administered by two permanent Commissioners, ap- pointed by the First Lord of the Treasury. Their duty is to examine all candidates for the Civil Service in respect of age, health and character; they also make arrangements for all literary examinations for the Home Civil Service, for the Indian Civil Service, and for the admission of candidates to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich and the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. COMMISSIONERS.-W.J.Courthope, C. B. (First); Lord Francis Hervey (Second). SECRETARY-S. M. Leathes. COLLEGE OF ARMS, OR HER- ALDS&apos; COLLEGE (Queen Victoria Street, E.C.), not strictly a Government Department, is presided over by the Here- ditary Earl Marshal(the Duke of Norfolk). Its officers carry out Royal proclamations, grant coats of arms, direct public funerals, and transact genealogical and similar business. Attached to the Department are three Kings of Arms, bearing res- pectively the titles of Garter, Clarenceux, and Norroy; six Heralds (Chester, York, Windsor, Somerset, Lancaster, and Rich- mond), four Pursuivants, and a Registrar. GARTER KING OF ARMS-Sir A. S. Scott-Gatty, Kt., C.V.O. COLONIAL OFFICE (Downing Street, S. W.)is presided over by a Secretary of State (changing with the Ministry), assisted by one Permanent, one Parlia- mentary, and four Assistant Under-Secre- taries. In the Colonies having responsible Government, the Colonial Secretary recommends the Governors to the Crown for appointment, and has power to advise the disallowance of laws passed by Colonial Legislatures, where they conflict with Imperial legislation or touch on Imperial interests, but otherwise exercises little interference. In the Crown Colonies, on the other hand, he exercises direct executive action, and all important officers are appointed by the Crown on his recommen- dation. Their legislation is subject to re- vision, and the Colonial Secretary exercises considerable control over their expenditure. COLONIAL SECRETARIES SINCE 1867.

UNDER-SECRETARY.-- Sir Fran- cis J. S. Hopwood, K.C.B., K.C.M.G. CROWN AGENTS FOR THE COLONIES (Whitehall Gardens, S. W., and 1, Token- house Buildings, E.C.).--These officials, three in number, are appointed by the Secretary of State, and transact under his supervision all the financial, commercial, emigration, and other business in this country on behalf of such of the Colonial Governments as are not represented by Agents-General, together with that of certain Protectorates under the Foreign Office. In the case of the Colonies having responsible Government this work is done by the Agents-General, who are appointed by the several Colonial Gov- ernments (see page 33). The Crown Agents&apos; salaries and expenses are defrayed from a fund derived from the Govern- ments for whom they act, the scale of charges being fixed by the Colonial Secre- tary. The office is thus self-supporting. CROWN AGENTS.--Sir E. E. Blake, K.C.M.G.; Major M. A. Cameron, C.M.G.; W. H. Mercer, C.M.G. An EMIGRANTS&apos; INFORMATION OFFICE (31, Broadway, Westminster, S.W.) was organised by the late Mr. E. Stanhope when Colonial Secretary in 1886. Its duty is to collect and circulate the latest and most useful and accurate information respecting the Colonies, for the guidance of intending emigrants, and to answer personal enquiries (which average about 6,000 per annum), but it does not promote or discourage emigration, nor is it responsible for advising emigrants in the selection of their destination.

See under Inland Revenue. &quot; &quot;20 THE CONSTITUTION. 66 29 i.e., The term, &amp;quot;The English Constitu- tion,&amp;quot; is commonly so used as to include both the form of public Government u der which we live, and the constitutional rights and privileges of private citizens. Considering the various forms of Govern- ment as either &amp;quot;absolute,&amp;quot; or pure,&apos; or &amp;quot;mixed,&amp;quot; the English Constitution belongs to the latter category. By this is meant, that the voice of the ultimate sovereign power, which is the constituent body of the nation, is so obtained as to give expression to the various classes and interests of the collective community. Again, constitutions being either &amp;quot;written&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;unwritten,&amp;quot; the English Constitution is &amp;quot;unwritten,&amp;quot; although it results, in some measure, from the decisions of judges, and the pro- visions of statutes, such as Magna Chart&amp;quot;, the Petition of Right, or the Bill of Rights, such decisions and statutes are avowedly declaratory merely of the pre- existing law. Whereas, then, in the case of written Constitutions, such as that of the United States, the question of the bearing of proposed changes upon the Constitution of the State is one of mere interpretation, and to be decided by the ordinary tribunals; in England, on the contrary, &amp;quot;unconstitutional&amp;quot; conduct on the part of a Minister can only mean a violation of the spirit of the Constitution, and can only be reached by the extra ordi- nary proceeding of impeachment, which is defined as &amp;quot;a judicial trial by the House of Lords of a person accused by the House of Commons of grave offences, which the ordinary law cannot reach, through its in- sufficiency or uncertainty.&amp;quot; This proceed- ing has, in modern times, become rare, but in extraordinary cases might still be re- sorted to. The Constitution of England is a LIMITED MONARCHY, the supreme political authority being vested in a King or Queen, and two Houses of Parliament. It being conceded that in every constitution which is the growth of ages, and which exercises sway over mixed populations, &amp;quot;there must be two parts, first, that which excites and preserves the reverence of the population -the dignified parts-and next, the efficient parts, those by which it in fact works and rules,&amp;quot; the distinctive merit of the English Constitution is, that while its &amp;quot;efficient part&amp;quot; works more easily and simply and better than any instrument of government which has yet been tried, its 6.6 &amp;quot;&amp;quot; dignified parts are still as capable of exciting and sustaining enthusiasm as when the King was his own Prime Minister. The secret of the efficiency of the English Constitution lies in the close union of the executive and legislative power. The connecting link is THE CABINET. By that word, which is technically un- known to any Act of Parliament or in official proceedings, is meant a committee of the legislative body, selected to be the executive body; a committee, however. which has the power of advising the dis- solution of the assembly which indire tly appointed it. Though appointed under one Parliament, it can, with the per- mission of the Sovereign appeal to the next. It is nominated by the Crown, but being also responsible to Parliament, it consists exclusively of statesmen whose opinions agree in the main with the majority of the House of Commons. Among the members of this committee are distributed the great departments of the Administration. Each Minister con- ducts the ordinary business of his own office without reference to his colleagues; but the most important affairs of every department, and especially such matters as are likely to be the subject of discussion in Parliament, are brought under the consideration of the whole Ministry. When Lord Salisbury&apos;s third Ministry came into office in 1895, a Cabinet Com- mittee for National Defence was con- stituted, under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister. The functions of this body, now called the COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE, have been remodelled. It consists of the Prime Minister, the Secretaries of State for War and India, the First Lord of the Admiralty, Viscount Esher, and General Sir John French; the chief of the General Staff, the first Sea Lord, and the Directors of Military and Naval Intelligence; other high officials are called into council as oc- casion requires. Perennial records are kept of its conclusions and of the reasons on which they are based. While the Commit- tee in no way limits the responsibility of the Cabinet as a whole, it provides a ma- chinery by which the military policy of the country shall be, as far as possible, continu- ous, and shall be based upon the authority of the most competent experts. The estab- lishment of the Committee was formally approved by the House of Commons on March 5th, 1903. In Parliament, the MINISTERS are bound to act as one man in all questions relating to the Executive Government. If one of them dissents from the rest on a question too important to admit of com- promise, it is his duty to retire. While the Ministry retains the confidence of the Parliamentary majority, that majority &quot; &quot;THE UNIONIST PRESS. 387 Name. Day of Publication, and Price. Office.

Provisions as to Teachers. 8.-(1) A teacher employed in a public elementary school shall not give any religious instruction of a special character not permitted under section fourteen of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, in any school in which facilities for that instruction are afforded under this Act, except where permitted to do so by the local education authority in cases where extended facilities are so afforded. (2) A teacher employed in a public elementary school shall not be required as part of his duties as teacher to give any religious instruction, and shall not be required as a condition of his appoint- ment to subscribe to any religious creed, or to attend or abstain from attending any Sunday school or place of religious worship. (3) Where a local education authority continue an existing voluntary school under this Act as a school provided by them, any teachers in the school at the time of the transfer shall continue to hold office under the local education authority by the same tenure and on the same terms and conditions so far as they are consistent with the provisions of this Act as before the transfer. (4) Any teacher employed at the time of the passing of this Act in an existing voluntary school who loses his employ- ment by reason of the school ceasing to be a public elementary school in conse- quence of this Act, shall be entitled, in accordance with regulations made for the purpose by the Treasury and the Board of Education, notwithstanding anything in the Elementary School Teachers Superannuation Act, 1898, or the rules made under that Act, to pay contributions to the deferred annuity fund under that Act during any time (not exceeding one year after the date at which he so loses his employment) in which he is not employed in recorded service, and to reckon the time in respect of which contributions are so made as if were recorded service. it. AS IT LEFT THE LORDS. Provisions as to Teachers. 9.-(1) A teacher employed in a public elementary school shall be permitted by the local education authority to give any religious instruction of a special character not permitted under section fourteen of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, in any school in which facilities for that instruction are afforded under this Act. (2) A teacher seeking employment or employed in a public elementary school (otherwise than as a teacher of religious subjects only) shall not be required as part of his duties as teacher to give any religious instruction, but he may give such instruction if he is willing to do so, and shall not be required as a condition of his appointment to subscribe to any religious creed, or to attend or abstain from attending any Sunday school or place of religious worship. Provided that nothing in this Act shall prevent the local education authority from satisfying themselves as to the fitness of any person who is willing to undertake to give religious instruction of the character permitted under section fourteen of the Elementary Education Act, 1870. (3) In every public elementary school in which extended facilities are afforded under this Act, the local education authority shall consult with the parents committee as to the appointment of any persons to be teachers in the school, and shall satisfy themselves that the persons so appointed are qualified and willing to give the religious instruction for which the extended facilities are afforded. (4) Where a local education authority continue an existing voluntary school under this Act as a school provided by them, any teachers in the school at the time of the transfer shall continue to hold office under the local education authority by the same tenure and on the same terms and conditions so far as they are consistent with the provisions of this Act as before the transfer. (5) Any teacher employed at the time of the passing of this Act in an existing voluntary school who loses his employ- ment by reason of the school ceasing to be a public elementary school in conse- quence of this Act, shall be entitled, in accordance with regulations made for the purpose by the Treasury and the Board of Education, notwithstanding anything in the Elementary School Teachers Superannuation Act, 1898, or the rules made under that Act, to pay contributions to the deferred annuity fund under that Act during any time &quot; &quot;92 36 HOUSE OF LORDS.

L-Lord Loreburn (L.), Ld. Chancellor, moved the 2nd R., explaining the object of the measure as being to legalize peaceful picketing, to remove the existing liability for interfering with another&apos;s business, and to prohibit actions of tort against trade unions except in certain circumstances. He admitted that picketing was a difficult subject, but argued that it had been legalized in 1875, and was lawful for peaceful persuasion; and the law of conspiracy, as contained in the Bill, conformed to the existing law and the recommendations of the Royal Commission.-Lord Lansdowne admitted that some legislation for the relief of trade union funds was inevitable, though he doubted whether the remedy demanded was met by the Bill. It now did what the Atty.-Genl. said they never should do. Picketing, he believed, was replete with dangerous consequences, and he regarded the clause of the Bill dealing with trade disputes as far-reaching and alarming The country, however, had demanded the Bill, and the only course open was to pass it.-Lord Halsbury (C.) denounced the Bill as unjust, and contrary to English liberty. By it, a man might wrong his neighbour and could not be made amenable. That was contrary to the whole spirit of our law.→ Lord Kelvin (L.U.) also denounced the Bill as an offence against liberty and justice.— Lord James of Hereford supported the 2nd R. but objected to rendering the funds of the unions immune, as it was class legislation.-Lord Crewe said the Bill established no new principle, and it aimed at bringing about a satisfactory settlement of the whole question.-Read a second time. Dec. 4. 66 In Committee on Cl. 2 (peaceful picketing), Lord Wemyss (C.) moved to limit the number of persons to be engaged in picketing to not more than three.&amp;quot;-Withdrawn. -Lord Balfour (C.) moved to insert words that the pickets should attend &amp;quot; peaceably and in a reasonable manner.&amp;quot;-Carried by 72 to 49.-Lord Donoughmore (C.) pro- posed a new clause providing that the Bill should not apply to a dispute connected with the occupation of land.-The Ld. Chancellor denied that landlords or tenants came within the Bill at all.-The clause was carried by 64 to 20, and the Bill was reported. Dec. 12. On Report, Lord Balfour moved that union trustees shall not be liable for any tortious act committed for or on behalf of the union where such act did not concern the property of the trade union.—Agreed to.-The Bill was read a third time and passed. (See STATUTES, post.) Dec. 14. C-TRADE UNIONS AND TRADE DISPUTES BILL (No. 2).-Mr. Hudson (Lab.) moved the 2nd R. of the Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Bill, which, like the Govt. Bill, proposed to legalize peaceful picketing and to amend the law of conspiracy, but also to enact that an action shall not be brought against a trade union for the recovery of damages sustained by any person by reason of the action of any members of the union. Mr. F. E. Smith (C.) reviewed the legal aspect of the question, and denied that trade unions had ever enjoyed the complete financial immunity now claimed.-Mr. Clancy (N.) supported the Labour Party, and looked forward to a similar Bill for tenants&apos; combinations in Ireland.-Mr. K. Hardie (Lab.) argued that trade unions and strikes were lawful, and the strike funds ought not to be at the mercy of the employers. The Govt. Bill was not acceptable to the Labour Party. It merely set up barbed-wire entanglements for the protection of their funds. If the House of Peers entered into a conflict with the Labour movement they would rue the day.- Sir H. C.-Bannerman referred to the Bills passed between 1871 and 1880 as beneficent measures, but said that judicial decisions had defeated the intentions of Parliament. The Labour members merely asked for the restoration of old rights. He should vote for their Bill. It was in harmony with the Govt. Bill on two points, and on the third point there was only a difference of method. The points of detail could be settled in Committee.-Mr. Wyndham (C.) was amazed that the Prime Minister should vote for a Bill against which his Attorney-General had warned the House. The principle of complete immunity for trade union funds could not be restricted to such unions. The action of the Govt. was almost a breach of faith with the House. He moved the adjournment of the debate, which was rejected by 370 to 66.-The closure having been carried by a majority of 336, the Bill was read a second time by 416 to 66. March 30. TRUCK ACT.-Sir C. Dilke (L.) called attention to the law of Truck, declaring that fines and deductions from wages ought to be prohibited. After other speeches, Mr. H. Samuel (L.), Under-Secy., admitted that the Act of 1896 had failed in its object. Legislation could not be introduced until 1907, and in the interval an inquiry by com- mittee would be set on foot. The Govt. accepted the resolution with the addition that Parliament reserved the right to legalize such fines and deductions as it might regard as legitimate.-The motion, so modified, was agreed to.

Appeals to the Board of Education as respects Extended Facilities. 5.-(1) Where the local education authority refuse to agree to an arrange- ment offered to them by the owners of the schoolhouse of an existing voluntary school as respects the use of the school- house, and the school is one in respect of which extended facilities are desired, the owners of the schoolhouse may appeal to the Board of Education, and that Board may, if they are satisfied that all the conditions requisite before extended facilities can be granted in a school under this Act are fulfilled in the case of the school, and, if they think fit, after considering the circumstances of the case, and the wishes of the parents of children attending the school as to the continuance of the school with extended facilities, by order, make an arrangement under this Act with respect to the use of the schoolhouse on such terms and con- ditions as may be contained in the order, including a condition requiring extended facilities to be afforded, but if under any AS IT LEFT THE LORDS. provisions of this section shall apply in such a case as they apply in the case of a school which has actually become a transferred voluntary school. (4) A prior right of admission to any school in respect of which extended facilities have been granted under this section shall be secured to the children of any parent residing within the area for which the school is available, on a signed declaration to the local education authority that he wishes the child to receive the benefit of the special religious instruction given in the school. (5) In all schools affected by a permis- sion under this section, the parents of the children attending the school shall elect, in accordance with regulations to be made for the purpose by the Board of Education, four persons, some of whom may be women, who, together with one other person nominated by the owners, and one other person nominated by the local education authority, shall be known as the parents committee. The parents committee shall be responsible for, and have the control of, the religious in- struction given in the school. (6) A ballot for the purposes of this section shall be taken in accordance with regulations made for the purpose by the Board of Education, and those regulations may incorporate with the necessary modifications any of the provisions of the Ballot Act, 1872 (in- cluding the penal provisions thereof). Appeals to Commission as respects Facilities. 11. (1) Where the local education authority fail to accept an arrangement offered to them by the owners of the schoolhouse of an existing voluntary school as regards the use of the school- house, and the school is one in respect of which facilities in accordance with sections three or four of this Act are desired, the owners of the schoolhouse may appeal to the Commission appointed under this Act, and that Commission shall, unless they are of opinion that the schoolhouse is not structurally suitable, or that the school is not required to meet the wishes of the parents as regards the religious instruction of their children, or that, after taking these matters into consideration, there are still sufficient grounds of refusal, by order require the local education authority to continue the school as a public elementary school provided by them, on such terms and conditions as respects the use of the schoolhouse as may be provided by the &quot; &quot;NATIONAL UNION OF CONSERVATIVE AND CONSTITUTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS.

After closure the amendment was rejected by 285 to 84. June 22. Sir F. Banbury (C.) proposed to strike out of the clause words which he said benefited tenants who took farms in good condition and left them impoverished.-Rejected by 226 to 74.—Col. Kenyon-Slaney (C.) moved that the compensation payable by a land- lord should be the value of improvements to an incoming tenant desirous of farming in accordance with local custom.-Negatived by a majority of 202.-Mr. A. Smith (C.) proposed to strike out the words leaving the decision of disputes to one arbitrator.- Mr. Guest (L.) defended landlords against an attack by Mr. Seddon (Lab.)-After closure the amendment was rejected by 292 to 112.-Mr. Cochrane (L.U.) moved to exclude existing tenancies from the Bill; but the amendment was negatived by a large majority. The clause was closured and passed. June 29. On the Report stage being entered upon, Mr. Balfour moved the adjourn- ment to complain that the Govt. had acted arbitrarily in their management of business and in breach of the resolution which gave Govt. business precedence. No hint had been given that they meant to make this Bill their own. If it had been known, the 2nd R. would certainly not have been easily passed, and this had been obtained by false pretences.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman contended that there had been no irregularity, and that Ministers had frequently adopted controversial unofficial Bills. ---After upwards of two hours&apos; debate, Sir H. C.-Bannerman moved the closure, which was carried by 356 to 104, and the motion to adjourn negatived.-On Cl. 1 various amendments were brought forward and negatived.-Sir F. Banbury moved to omit Cl. 2.-Motion withdrawn after debate.-Mr. M.-Thomson moved to confine it to future tenancies.-Mr. Lambert (L.) insisted that sitting tenants needed protection.-Mr. Cochrane pointed out that land was often let at a low rent in view of possible damage from game. In such cases compensation should not be payable. Nov. 6. On Cl. 2, Sir W. S. Robson (L) moved an amendment, that when under a contract, before the passing of the Act, the landlord agreed to pay compensation for damage by game, the arbitrator should, in assessing compensation, make a deduction from the compensation.-An amendment having been defeated, the proposal was agreed to. Nov. 8. Lord Turnour (C.) moved that compensation should not be payable for damage done by stray fallow deer.-Negatived by 319 to 78.-A long debate ensued as to the position of landlords and tenants in the New Forest, where the former had no right to kill the deer.-The 3rd Cl. (right of killing hares and rabbits with firearms) was struck out of the Bill.-Sir F. Banbury moved the rejection of Cl. 4 (freedom of crop- ping).—The debate on this and succeeding clauses was kept up through an all-night sitting. Nov. 12-13. On Cl. 5 (compensation to tenant for unreasonable disturbance), Mr. Remnant moved to omit it.-Sir E. Strachey said its object was to provide compensation when a landlord exercised his rights harshly or capriciously. The number of such landlords was, he believed, infinitesimal.-Sir W. S. Robson said the Govt. would consent to modify the clause, by accepting Col. Kenyon-Slaney&apos;s amendment that when a tenant left his holding because the rent was raised he should only be entitled to compensation when the increase was demanded in respect of improvements effected at the tenant&apos;s cost, for which he had received no equivalent.—Mr. Balfour pointed out the incon- venience caused by adopting an unofficial member&apos;s Bill and admitting such important amendments on Report. This legislation might lead to dual ownership. Why should not a landlord have compensation when a tenant quitted his holding unreasonably? Landlord and tenant were co-operating capitalists.-Sir W. S. Robson admitted that the clause would effect an important change in the law, and would give compensation when there had been no breach of contract. He denied that it would lead to dual ownership. The motion was negatived by 289 to 75. Nov. 13. Sir W. Robson moved that a tenant evicted without sufficient cause should, in addition to compensation for improvements, be entitled to compensation for the loss sustained in connection with the sale or removal of his goods.-Amendments were discussed and ultimately the clause was passed.-On Cl. 7 Sir E. Strachey announced further concessions by which the clause would be re-cast, and the definition of improvements, &amp;amp;c., made clearer. Some Radical members opposed, but were defeated by large majorities. Nov. 14. The Bill was read a third time after a long debate. Sir H. Kimber moved the rejection of the Bill because it disregarded the principle of inviolability of contracts.- Mr. Long questioned whether it now contained much to which practical agriculturists &quot; &quot;324 PARLIAMENTARY SUMMARY, 1906. C-Labour Questions *ACCIDENTS BILL.-Mr. H. Samuel (L.), Under Secy., moved the 2nd R. of the Notice of Accidents Bill, which was designed to obtain more useful returns in regard to accidents than were procurable. In regard to factories and workshops notification would be required of any accident incapacitating a workman for a clear day.-Read a second time and referred to the Standing Committee on Trade, March 6. The Bill subsequently became law. (See STATUTES, post) COAL MINES (EIGHT HOURS BILL).—Mr. Brunner (L.) moved the 2nd R. of a Bill &apos;to limit the daily hours of work in mines to eight hours, by means of a gradual reduction extending over three years.-Mr. John Wilson, Durham (Lab.), opposed the Bill as a revolution in the system of mining in the northern counties. After further discussion Mr. Gladstone (L.), Home Secy., agreed that the machinery of the Bill should be referred to a departmental committee, and it was read a second time. FACTORY ACTS.-In Supply on the Home Office vote, Mr. H. Gladstone (L.), Home Secy., replied to criticisms of his Department, and announced that he had appointed three lady inspectors. May 11. Aug. 1. RAILWAY SERVANTS.—Mr. Alden (L.) moved a resolution that the hours of many railway servants were still excessive, notwithstanding the Act of 1893, and ought to be reduced.-Mr. Ll.-George (L.), Pres. Bd. of Trade, said a strong case had been made out for interference, and he undertook that the Bd. of Trade would use all its present powers, and said that pressure ought to be exercised upon backward companies. --The resolution was carried. May 16. L—SUNDAY TRADING.—Lord Avebury (L.U.) moved that the subject of the Sunday opening of shops demanded the serious and early attention of H.M. Govt.-The Abp. of Canterbury emphasized the importance of inquiry without further delay, as Sunday trading was on the increase.-Lord Tweedmouth (L.), for the Govt., agreed that the whole question deserved earnest attention, and said they would accept the motion, on the understanding that a joint committee of the two Houses should be appointed.— Agreed to. March 9. C-*TRADE UNION AND TRADES DISPUTES BILL.-Sir L. Walton (L.), Atty.-Genl., introduced the Govt. Bill for the regulation of trade unions and trade disputes. He said the law of conspiracy, as now interpreted, made it impossible to tell beforehand what legal action a trade union might take; the right of peaceful persuasion had been impaired and provident funds made liable for the acts of unauthorized officials. The law operated unfairly against combinations of workmen, and it was therefore proposed to return to the principle established by the Act of 1875, viz., that the act of a trade union should be lawful or unlawful, assuming it to have been committed by an in- dividual, and not in combination. As to picketing, the Bill would give the right to persuade peacefully. The problem of agency was the most difficult part of the subject, and trade unions had been treated too rigorously, and made liable for the hasty or rash act of some official, or the imprudent act of a branch committee. The Bill would define the law of agency in regard to trade unions by disallowing any claim against trade funds unless arising out of the act of the governing body of the union, who must appoint an executive committee. The union would only be bound by a resolution of the executive or the act of persons authorized by them. If an agent, or the executive, committed an unauthorized act, the union funds would not be liable. The Labour members, he knew, would prefer a general declaration that no action should ever be brought, but if trade unions were placed in such a favourable position other organiza- tions would demand to be treated in the same way. The proletariate would be a privileged class, and trade unions and their agents would have no sense of responsibility, for whatever they might do the union funds would not suffer. There was no pre- scriptive right to such immunity. The Bill was an honest attempt to do justice. The Labour members who asked for immunity would receive most friendly consideration, and ultimately the decision must be left with the House.-Mr. Shackleton (Lab.) regretted that it was not proposed to render trade union funds immune.-Sir E. Carson (C.) said trade unionists were by this Bill given very special privileges, and employers who had suffered loss would have no remedy. There was no limit to the number of workmen who might engage in &amp;quot;peaceful persuasion.&amp;quot; Benevolent funds might well be relieved from liability, but the Bill would make havoc in the law of agency.-Mr. Brace (Lab.) said trade unionists asked for no special privileges. The Bill was certainly not satisfactory in all respects. If a trade unionist did wrong, let him be punished, but the union funds ought not to suffer.-The Bill was read a first time. March 28. Sir W. Robson (L.), Solr.-Genl., moved the 2nd R. of the Bill, and replied to the arguments of opponents. He said that it proceeded on the sound lines of policy laid down in 1871-that the objects of trade unions were for the most part such as Courts of law ought not to interfere with. For 30 years less industrial disturbance had occurred here than abroad, and there was no reason for apprehension from the &quot; &quot;256 MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES, 1885-1907. Tillett, Ben Tillett, J.

L-Education--*EDUCATION BILL-continued. on the motion of Lord Salisbury, struck out on a division by 120 to 34, and the Bp. of Oxford moved to substitute a new clause that if it was considered that a new elementary school, with facilities for special religious instruction, was required in a dis- trict, the persons concerned might provide a school-house, and, subject to the sanction of the Bd. of Education, it should be treated as though it were the school-house of an existing voluntary school.-Agreed to.-On Cl. 7 (attendance during the time of religious instruction not to be compulsory), Lord Ampthill (L.U.) moved its omission. -Lord Crewe denied that the Govt. had any idea of setting a badge of inferiority on religious teaching.-Lord Lansdowne said that although he was opposed to anything like compulsion in respect to religious instruction, the clause offered a distinct induce- ment to parents to withhold their children from religious instruction.-The clause was struck out by 143 to 31. Nov. 8. Lord Llandaff moved to substitute for Cl. 7 words providing that a child shall be required, with certain reservations, to attend at the school-house during the hours allotted to instruction in religious subjects.-The Bp. of Hereford said he was content with Cowper Temple teaching and moved an amendment.-Lord Llandaff&apos;s clause was carried by 151 to 43.-On Cl. 8 (a teacher not to give any special religious in- struction except where permitted by the local authority), Lord Monkswell (L.) said that the clause should only apply to teachers appointed after the passing of the Bill.— The Abp. of Canterbury held that no teacher ought to be compelled to give religious teaching, but where a teacher was willing to give instruction it was intolerable to prohibit him from giving it. He bore testimony to the self-sacrifice of teachers in voluntary schools. An amendment by Lord Cawdor to provide that the teacher shall be permitted by the local authority to give special religious instruction was carried by 147 to 46. Nov. 12. Lord Stanley of Alderley (L.) moved that a teacher shall be appointed without reference to religious creed or denomination.-Rejected by 191 to 10.-Lord Llandaff moved that the teacher might give religious instruction if willing to do so.-Agreed to.-The Abp. of Canterbury moved that the local authority should be bound to satisfy themselves as to the qualification of any teacher for giving religious instruction, and that a selection committee should be formed consisting of five persons, three of whom should represent parents. While they rightly abolished tests, there ought, he said, to be inquiry as to the personal qualifications of a teacher to give religious instruction.-Lord Crewe proposed alternatively that the local education authority should not be debarred from ascertaining the capacity of a teacher to give religious instruction under the Act of 1870.-Agreed to. Nov. 14. The Abp. of Canterbury moved that the consent of a parents&apos; committee should be required to the appointment of teachers, but on religious grounds only.-Lord Crewe said that this was contrary to the principle of the Bill, as amounting to a religious test. Conflicts would arise between the committee and the local authority, and the Board of Education could not deal with such a difficult and delicate matter.-Lord St. Aldwyn argued that the rights claimed could not be denied to denominational schools, but he suggested an alteration, that the local authority should consult with the parents&apos; committee as to the appointment of a teacher and satisfy themselves that he was qualified and willing to give religious instruction in such schools. This would preserve public control.-Lord Lansdowne argued that these were denominational schools, and the Govt. had said that their character would be preserved, but this was impossible unless the suggested precautions were taken.-An enlarging amendment by Lord Clifford having been defeated by 137 to 49, Lord St. Aldwyn&apos;s suggestion was agreed to, and the clause was added to the Bill.-On Cl. 9, Lord Llandaff moved to omit the part defining the principles on which the Commission should act in certain cases.-Carried by 91 to 30. Nov. 15. Lord Barnard (L.U.) moved that the Commission might make provision by scheme for the use of a school-house for the purpose of a public elementary school.-Agreed to. Further amendments were discussed and Cls. 9-12 were passed.-On Cl. 13 (grant of one million), Lord Belper moved that it should be in addition to the amount now paid under Parliamentary grants.-Lord Crewe considered that the sum men- tioned was a liberal estimate, having regard to all the facts. The Govt. had not calculated what the actual charge would be.-Lord Lansdowne said it was clear that they were ignorant of the financial aspects of the Bill.-Amendment withdrawn.-- The Abp. of Canterbury moved a new clause authorizing the creation of the class of &amp;quot;State-aided&amp;quot; schools, not receiving rate aid and free from local control. Nov. 19. Lord Avebury (L.U.) supported the clause, as it would promote economy and increase local interest.Lord Crewe held that it proposed to set up a class of schools with a sort of barbed-wire entanglement, directly contrary to the whole scheme of &quot; &quot;140 HOUSE OF COMMONS.

The Bond held dominion in Cape Colony, and it was very risky to give responsible government to the Orange River Colony unless they were sure of a loyal Transvaal. What was wanted was industrial development, which was now paralysed. He had at first been opposed to Chinese labour, but had changed his views owing to the great need of more labour. The Chinese were delighted to come, and he warned the Govt. that they might give a permanent bent to the whole of S. Africa. If they lost S. Africa once they would lose it for ever. -Lord Harris (C.) denounced the Govt.&apos;s declarations with regard to Chinese labour, and demanded a public impartial inquiry on oath.-Lord Elgin (L.), Colonial Secy., paid a warm tribute to the courage and devotion of Lord Milner and declined responsi- bility for the use of the term slavery in connection with Chinese labour. He d nied, however, that the Ordinance was consistent with the condition and rights of free men in regard to fines, etc., and asserted that there had been irregularities in regard to flogging. The humane treatment of the coolies had been now secured. He doubted whether an inquiry would be useful. They hoped that before long the Transvaal, under responsible government, would be able to decide on the labour question, and they would know that the continuance of the present system would not be sanctioned. Several Colonies had declared against Chinese labour, and this country had shown its opinion at the elections. H.M. Govt. could not now indicate the nature of their proposals as to granting responsible government, but it had resulted in pros- perity and loyalty in Canada. Feb. 26. Lord Roberts agreed fully with the views of Lord Milner as to the danger of placing power in the hands of the disloyal, and abandoning the British settlers who had as great claims as the Boers. Unless the franchise was settled on a basis fair to the British population the entire control would be in the hands of those whose object was to drive the British out of S. Africa, including those men who had fought and bled for their country. Lord Halifax (L.U.) described the Chinese compounds as seen by him, and condemned the misrepresentation of facts which had taken place.-Lord Ports- mouth (L.), Under Secy., asked whether it was true that slight corporal punishment had been sanctioned by Lord Milner.-Lord Milner admitted responsibility. The punishment was not for refusal to work or desertion, but for acts of violence and disturbance of order which were against the interests of the coolies themselves. Subse- quent events showed that he was wrong, because abuses might have crept in.-Lord Loreburn (L.), Ld. Chancellor, said that, in his opinion, the policy of Lord Milner in regard to the war had been a great blunder. Chinese labour was ill-advised from the outset. What would happen if some great Chinese labour invasion of Europe took place. It would not be tolerated. There were 120,000 white men in the Transvaal, and 60,000 Chinese were poured in against the wishes of our Colonies, against the opinion of Mr. Chamberlain, and against the earnest protests of the Liberal party. The system was semi-slavery. The only remedy was responsible self-government and consolidation of the white race so that they could live peacefully under the British Crown.-Lord Halsbury (C.) condemned the election cartoons on the Chinese question. -Lord Lansdowne (L.U.) said that all parties wished to give responsible government, but differed as to the means. Steps ought to be taken to protect the loyalist population. He hoped the House would see the proposals of the Govt. before they were an accomplished fact. The charge of slavery had been frankly dropped, so there was no need for inquiry. The importation was an experiment and it was a success. Feb. 27. C—Mr. Byles (Lab.) moved a resolution declaring that in any settlement of S. African affairs this country should recognise its Imperial responsibility for the protection of all races excluded from political rights; that all immigrants should be safeguarded against servile conditions of labour, and that the existing status of the native populations should be guaranteed, with the continued possession of their liberties in Basutoland, Bechuanaland, and other tribal countries and reservations. Mr. Wedgwood (L.) resented, from experience, the charge that the Kaffirs were ill-treated. Mr. Churchill (L.) said the Govt. accepted the motion. The treatment of the natives would be a subject on which the Govt. must be consulted in the new arrangements, and they would not allow any system of taxation which would compel natives to work under other than ordinary economic conditions. Lord Milner was regarded by the Dutch as their prime enemy, and had to rely for support on the mine-owners. The taxation of the natives was increased, but the lash had been much disused under Lord Milner, chiefly through Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s influence. In Natal, as was known, the native question had assumed features which had caused apprehension, but prompt action had prevented a rising. There had been no oppression of the people in Natal, but the S. African natives had been excited by the war, and the situation required serious &quot; &quot;28 THE CIVIL LIST AND ROYAL GRANTS. consequent uncertainty of the future, they do not recommend that any such provision should be made on the present occasion, and content themselves by recording the fact that nothing for this purpose is included either in the Civil List or in the annuities proposed. &amp;quot;Your Committee have already called attention to the fact that the annuity granted by the Prince of Wales&apos;s Children Act, 1889, ceases on 22nd July, 1901. It is, therefore, necessary to make fresh pro- vision for their Royal Highnesses Princess Louise (Duchess of Fife), Princess Vic- toria and Princess Maud (Princess Charles of Denmark). Your Committee accord- ingly recommend that an annuity of £18,000 for their joint lives, diminishing by £6,000 with each death, should, in accordance with the precedent of the Prince of Wales&apos;s Children Act, 1889, be paid to Trustees by quarterly payments out of the Consolidated Fund. Out of this fund the Sovereign, with the assent of the First Lord of the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, should be empowered to make such assignments and in such manner to their Royal High- nesses as in his discretion he may from time to time think fit.&amp;quot; In introducing the Bill to give effect to these recommendations, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, Chancellor of the Ex- chequer, explained that whatever re- mained from the private fortune or savings of Queen Victoria had been devoted to the benefit of her younger children, and that, therefore, the King had no personal fortune, and was de- pendent upon the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Parliamentary grant. Basing his calculations on the increase in the value of the surrendered hereditary revenues of the Crown, he estimated that during the next sixteen years the average annual cost of the Royal family to the taxpayer would not be more than £33,000. The proposals of the Committee were agreed to by Parlia- ment, and were embodied in the Civil List Act of 1901, referred to above. HIS MAJESTY&apos;S HOUSEHOLD. LORD STEWARD.-Earl of Liverpool.

C. &quot; &quot;77 ROYAL COMMISSIONS. ROYAL Commissions, as the Commissions of Inquiry instituted under the authority of the Crown are commonly designated, are constituted either by Special Act of Parliament, by an instrument under the Great Seal, or by Warrant under the Sign Manual. They have power to examine witnesses, and to send for persons, papers, and records, but in ordinary cases have not powers of commitment or indemnity. A Special Act of Parliament is necessary if it is desired to confer unusual powers. Ordinary Commissions now almost invariably issue under the Sign Manual. In Ireland, Commissions are appointed by the Lord Lieutenant, on behalf of His Majesty. The Reports of Royal Commissions are forwarded to the Secretary of State to be laid before the Sovereign, by whose command they are subsequently presented to Parliament. The powers of Commissions expire with the presentation of their Final Report, unless subsequently continued by authority. In addition to Commissions of Inquiry there are others of a more or less permanent nature, such as the Royal Commissions for the Exhibition of 1851, Army Purchase, Horse Breeding, Historical Manuscripts, the Universities, and for various home, foreign, and colonial Exhibitions. Others again, such as those for the Irish Land Acts, Lunacy, Public Works Loans, Railway and Canal Traffic, Light Railways, &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c., are virtually Departments of the Govern- ment or of the Judicature, and are noticed ante.

[The following pages describe the main functions exercised by the principal Departments and Officers of the Executive Government. Several Offices are included which, though not, strictly speaking, Government Departments, are intimately connected with them. In modern times, if a Department_is represented in Parliament by two officials, one, as a rule, is in each House. The Home Office is generally an exception (both Secretary of State and Under Secretary being in the House of Commons), and occasionally the Board of Trade and the Local Government Board. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, and usually the heads of the great spending Departments, are in the House of Commons. Chancellor, the Lord President of the Council, and the great Officers of the Household, are always Peers.] 66 ADMIRALTY (Whitehall, S.

L-Education-*EDUCATION BILL-continued. desire the abolition of the present dual system. Parents should have absolute freedom of choice in religious education. Thousands of children would get no religious teaching at all but for the voluntary schools. The present Bill, unaltered, would lead to the profoundest controversy in municipal and political matters.-Lord Loreburn (L.), (Ld. Chancellor), argued that there was no standard as to what were the &quot;views of the Church of England.&quot; Nonconformity was a tremendous force, and it would not allow in the schools the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of the Church of Rome or of any section of the Church of England. Cowper-Temple religion had been observed since 1870, and the majority of school children were now taught that religion. The only alternative was secularism..-Lord Lansdowne admitted that some modification of the Act of 1902 was inevitable; but they could not pass this Bill into law in its present shape as it would inflict grave injustice, out of all proportion to the alleged grievances which it proposed to remove. On the other hand it contained important principles showing a desire to deal in an equitable spirit with some of the questions raised. It was their duty, therefore, to try to meet it with the respect due from one House to the other; but in passing the 2nd R., they did not part with their right to deal with it in the future. They complained that the Bill did little for education while creating a great deal of heartburning.-Lord Ripon hoped that the provisions of the Bill would be better understood during the holidays. The Govt. had to deal with the state of affairs arising out of the Act of 1902 and the destruction of the School Boards, and had met it in an honest and reasonable spirit.-The Bill was then read a 2nd time. Aug. 3. C-Mr. Birrell explained that the Govt. were appealing to the House of Lords against the decision of the Court of Appeal on the subject of religious education, because practical difficulties of an administrative character had been occasioned by the case. Oct. 25. L-On going into Committee, Lord Stanmore decided not to proceed with his motion to defer the Bill until the questions raised by the West Riding decision were decided (see above).-Lord Goschen called special attention to Cl. 1, which he believed would involve endless confusion.-The Abp. of Canterbury also criticised the Bill generally.—After further debate the motion to go into Committee was agreed to. Oct. 25. In Committee on Cl. 1 a proposal by Lord Llandaff (C.) for its postponement was made and withdrawn.-Lord Heneage (L.U.) moved that a school should not be recognised &quot;unless some portion of the school hours of every day is set apart for religious instruction.&quot;-The Abp. of Canterbury said this was not an ecclesiastical question, but he pleaded for some declaration recognising the fact that there was to be religious teaching.-Lord Crewe asked what sort of definite religious instruction was wanted? There were those who favoured a simple reading of the Bible and the offering of one or two simple prayers, and there were others who held that this was no religious instruction at all. Was the Board of Education to settle it, or was it to be left to a court of law?-Lord Lansdowne supported a simple affirmation that the children should have religious instruction, and keeping the door open for it. If the Govt. refused, what confidence could be placed in their declarations that religious instruction ought to be an essential part of education ?--The discussion was continued by numerous speakers, and ultimately the amendment was carried by 256 to 56. Oct. 29. On the question that Cl. 1 stand part of the Bill, the Abp. of Canterbury said he should vote for it with reservations: (1) that popular control did not take away the obligation of providing for the different classes of schools; and (2) that the man who was going to give religious teaching was qualified for that work.-The clause was agreed to.-On Cl. 2 (arrangements regarding schoolhouses of existing voluntary schools), the Abp. of Canterbury moved that words providing that the school, if required by the owners, shall be continued&quot; be inserted.-Lord Crewe said the proposal of the Primate was a very extreme one.-Lord Lansdowne suggested further consideration of a difficult subject, and the amendment was postponed.-Some con- fusion on points of procedure followed, and a motion that the House do resume was carried by 215 to 58. Oct. 30. &quot;shall, if 66 The Abp. of Canterbury proposed that the local education authority required by the owners,&quot; continue any existing voluntary school. This was carried by 209 to 47.-Lord St. Aldwyn suggested words declaring that where an existing voluntary school was not to be continued, it should be incumbent on the local authority, on the requisition of the owners of the schoolhouse, to afford facilities for special religious instruction, hitherto given in the discontinued school, in some other school accessible to the children; also that the local authority might appeal to the Board of Education against closing a school on the ground that the school was not required. &apos; &quot;HOUSE OF LORDS 107 Redesdale, 1st Bar.

ECCLESIASTICAL AND CHURCH ESTATES COMMIS- SION (Millbank, S.W.) This Office, not strictly a Government Department, is administered by a body consisting of the archbishops, bishops, three deans, and twenty eminent laymen. The principal duties are discharged by the Church Estates Commissioners, the chief of whom, always a Peer, is nominated by the First Lord of the Treasury, one other is com- missioned by the Archbishop of Canter- bury, and one is ordinarily a member or supporter of the Government for the time being. They administer the large estates vested in them, and apply the proceeds in promoting the work and efficiency of the Church of England, and increasing its endowments. They have also power, under Acts of Parliament, to create new ecclesiastical districts. An annual report is made to the Home Secre- tary. It has been proposed to unite Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty Board (q.v.) with this Commission. CHURCH ESTATES COMMISSIONERS. Sir L. T. Dibdin, K. C. (Chairman); Rt. Hon. C. B. Stuart-Wortley, K.C., M.P., and C. E. H. Hobhouse, M.P. SECRETARY.-Sir A. de B. Porter, K. C. B. EDUCATION, BOARD OF (White- hall). The Board of Education was estab- lished in 1899, and is charged with the superintendence of all matters relating to Public Education. The Board consists of a President, and of the Lord President of the Council (unless he shall be appointed President), the Principal Secretaries of State, the First Lord of the Treasury, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Vice-President of the Committee of Council on Education was, up to 1902, a member of the Board, and responsible for the Department in the House of Commons, but in that year the office was abolished and a Parliamentary Secretary substitu- ted. The Board takes the place of the Committee of the Privy Council on Edu- cation (including the Department of Science and Art) and also under Order in Council has taken over some of the powers of the Charity Commissioners and the Board of Agriculture in relation to edu- cation. It may also inspect or superintend the inspection of secondary schools in England, desiring to be inspected. The Act also created a Consultative Com- mittee, upon which sit representatives of the Universities and other bodies interested in education, and questions may be referred to them by the Board. The Rt. Hon. Sir Wm. Hart Dyke is the Chairman of this Committee. The supervision of the Royal College of Science and Art, of the Victoria. and Albert Museum, the Bethnal Green Museum, of the Geological Museum in Jermyn St., and of the Geological Survey, rests with the Board. An Educational Library open to the public, is established at St. Stephen&apos;s House, Cannon Row, S. W. PRESIDENTS OF THE BOARD of EDUCATION. 1900 Duke of Devonshire, K.G..

Exclusive of the proportion of receipts from Probate Duty due to Local Taxation Accounts--- one-third in 1888-9, and one-half subsequently. tt NOTE. The amounts of property subjected to Duty, stated above, are not properly comparable with the amounts stated for earlier years, on account of the great changes introduced into the system of the Death Duties by the &amp;quot;Finance Act, 1894.&amp;quot; The New Estate Duty, which is in substitution of the former Probate and Account Duties and the old Estate Duty of 1889 (see note † above), applies to the estates of all persons dying after the 1st August, 1894; but while the Probate Duty applied only to personalty, the New Estate Duty applies to ALL PROPERTY, real or personal, settled or unsettled, passing at death. A further difference between the old and new systems is to be found in the provisions of the &amp;quot;Finance Act, 1894,&amp;quot; permitting, in certain circumstances, property to be declared and taken into consideration in fixing rates of duty on which duty may not actually be paid until subsequent years. The gross amount of capital of which the Inland Revenue Department had notice as passing at death in 1905-1906 was £308,236,437. Under the &amp;quot;Finance Act, 1894,&amp;quot; the Local Taxation Account receives 1 per cent. on all personalty in the United Kingdom passing by will or under intestacy.

C-Navy-*ESTIMATES-continued. 66 towards disarmament. This country depended for its very existence on the main- tenance of its sea-power, and therefore it was not for us to set the pace &quot; in regard to naval reduction. Mr. K. Hardie thought the action of the Govt. would be wel- comed by all friends of peace and arbitration. -Mr. Balfour said the decision was a momentous one and without adequate justification. The Govt. ought not to shelter themselves behind the Sea Lords. The grounds on which the experts had changed their opinion should be stated. The declarations of Ministers were inconsistent, for while they cut down the Army and the Navy, they at the same time asserted that our military striking force was 50 per cent. stronger than it had been, and that our Navy would still be equal to the navies of any two Powers. How could statesmen at The Hague Conference believe in their professions? No British Govt. would indulge in a war of aggression, but our duty was to make our forces sufficiently strong to defend our interests at home and abroad. One thing alone would ensure peace, and that was a conviction among foreign statesmen that it would be dangerous to attack us.- Sir H. C.-Bannerman said that if the Govt. thought that they were endangering the peace of the world by not building another first-class ironclad they would hurry to repair their error. The present Govt. adopted the Estimates of their predecessors, subject to a review of the Shipbuilding Vote. The Sea Lords held that the revised programme was sufficient to maintain our naval power, and the Govt. concurred. Was it likely that France and Germany would combine against us? By 1909 we should have four ships of the Dreadnought class, a vessel said to be almost incapable of defeat. No other country could compete with us in cheap and speedy construction. In regard to the subject of disarmament, it was desirable to put a stop to the con- tinuous rivalry between nations, and we could set the example with greater ease than other Powers.-The Vote was agreed to. July 27. L-Lord Brassey (L.) called attention to the new Admiralty policy, of which he strongly approved, but suggested that certain condemned vessels might still be found useful.-Lord Goschen (C.) said it was a great advantage that party spirit in regard to the Navy had vanished. The numerical redistribution of the Fleet and the administra- tive reforms were all in the right direction; but he urged that greater protection should be given in home waters, such as the Firth of Forth. As to short service, he insisted that the Admiralty ought not to touch the long-service system, which was of stupendous importance to the Navy.-Lord Cawdor (C.) said that the removal of ineffective ships had made the Navy more powerful than before and had saved much money. He also defended the recent policy in several particulars.--Lord Tweedmouth (L.), First Ld. of the Admy., said the Navy for 25 years had been undergoing a great revolution. He proposed to continue the new policy and give it a fair trial. It was not intended to apply short service to the higher rating class. March 6. Lord Tweedmouth made a statement as to the age limits for the entry of naval cadets, which would secure a uniform age of 13 for such cadets. April 3. Lord Brassey called attention to the question of Naval Reserves and to the shipbuilding programme of the present year.-Lord Cawdor (C.) criticised the building programme and the departure from the original scheme. He asked whether the Sea Lords originated the programme of reduction; had they before them a more drastic scheme of reduction; and were they told of any change in the policy of the Govt. as to the two-Power standard ?-Lord Tweedmouth (L.), without going into minute details, took the responsibility of saying that that scheme did not endanger the national position. The Sea Lords had simply been asked to review the situation and make their own proposals; and they were agreed on a policy of economy so long as the naval supremacy could be maintained. Other great Powers were showing a tendency to reduce or defer shipbuilding. It was our duty in some way to reduce the enormous expenditure of the last ten years. They could go to The Hague Conference with a good face, as they could show that successive Govts. had diminished the Naval Estimates and were prepared for further reduction on equal terms.-Lord Goschen (C.) complained of the contradiction between the statements made there and in the other House. As to the two-Power standard, it was a minimum, and there was a danger of not being prepared for sudden emergencies. There must be a margin, seeing what had been done in the Far East by mines and other appliances. The naval expenditure of Germany would not be affected by anything done at The Hague. July 30. C-FLOGGING. In the debate on the Address, Mr. MacNeill (N.) proposed an amend- ment in favour of abolishing flogging in the Navy. Feb. 20. Mr. E. Robertson (L.), Secy. to the Admy., stated that the Admiralty had directed that the punishment of birching should be suspended until further orders, and that caning should be inflicted only by order of the captain of a ship.-Capt. Hervey (C.) &apos; &quot;236 MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES, 1885-1907, Carew, J. L., d. Dublin, Coll. Green. .. Meath, S. Kildare, N. Carew, Gen. Sir R. Pole-Pembroke Dt. Carington, Lt.-Col. Hon.

It gave to the rich a right which the poor could not use.-Lord Ashbourne (C.) concurred.-Lord Loreburn disclaimed any party feeling in this matter, and defended the appeal to two or more Judges on the law and the facts. He denied that the Bill would favour the rich, and that the right of appeal would undermine a jury&apos;s responsibility. There should be a right of appeal in all criminal cases. He would accept an amendment allowing an appeal only when the Assize Judge or the Court of Criminal Appeal thought that there should be one.—Lord Halsbury (C.) opposed an appeal, on facts, to a Court which had not heard the witnesses.-Debate adjourned. May 22. The Bill having passed through Committee, on the 3rd R. Lord Alverstone criticised several of its proposals, and denied that a case had been made out for it.-The Bill was read a third time and passed, but was subsequently withdrawn in the House of Commons. July 12. L-Defence, National. Lord Ellenborough (C.) called attention to certain conferences of the Committee of Imperial Defence with the Newspaper Society on the question of the dissemination of news in time of war.-Lord Tweedmouth (L.) said the Govt. would make the subject one for legislation next Session.-Lord Cawdor (C.) promised the support of the Opposition. July 13. C-On the 2nd R. of the Appropriation Bill, a debate took place on the changes that should be made in the constitution of the Committee of Imperial Defence.--Maj. Seely advocated that representatives from the Colonies and India, and also of the Opposition should be added to the Committee.-Mr. Balfour demurred to the suggestion, as the Committee could not be treated as a substitute for the Cabinet, whose responsibility must remain. The Committee was a body summoned by the Prime Minister to assist him in dealing with questions outside the purview of any Department. He alone must decide whom to summon. There was a place opened for the Colonies when they wished to participate. He also objected to the suggestion that the leader of the Opposition should be on the Committee, as, if present, difficulties must arise, of which he gave examples. On the whole, he held that elements of danger would not be removed by mixing up the Opposition with the Govt. Party government was better than a hybrid arrangement.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman held that the defence Committee was a most satisfactory institution, enabling the Cabinet to obtain directly the opinion of the best experts of the Army and Navy. They did not decide the fundamental military and naval policy of the Govt., which were ques- tions of high policy with which the Cabinet alone dealt. He also agreed that repre- sentatives of the Colonies should not be permanent members of the Committee. Speaking on the two-Power standard for the Navy he said it was reasonable in certain circumstances, but not in all. But the Govt. had done nothing to weaken the practical strength of the country. Aug. 2. See also under ARMY AND NAVY and FINANCE. C-Education.-PROVISION OF MEALS BILL.-Mr. W. T. Wilson (Lab.) moved the 2nd R. of a Bill to compel local education authorities to provide food for public ele- mentary school children who are unable, by reason of want of food, to take full advan- tage of the education provided; also to sanction the provision of food for other children, the cost to be recoverable from parents and guardians, and not to be deemed to be parochial relief.-Sir H. Craik (C.) objected that the measure made no distinction between the parent who did his duty and the parent who did not.-Sir W. Collins (L.) described the Bill as frankly socialistic in its tendencies, but not necessarily bad.- Sir W. Anson (L.U.) argued that the selection of the children should be made by voluntary agencies. Under the Bill a man could, but would not, feed his children, who might get them fed at the cost of the ratepayers. The backward condition of the children in many schools was due not merely to want of food, but to late hours, impure atmosphere, and poor clothing. Local education authorities and boards of guardians might be empowered to deal with necessitous cases.--Mr. Birrell agreed to the 2nd R. as there was a certain number of children who were so hungry as to be unfit to be taught. The law required them to attend school and, as they could not be taught while hungry, they must be fed. The agency was the education authority, and they should not be discouraged from trying a system similar to that in Paris. Imposition might be prevented by some means which a Select Committee might investigate. Charity was apt to be fitful, and more was required. He hoped local authorities would utilise voluntary charitable agencies. The relations between local education authorities, Poor Law guardians and voluntary agencies could be considered in Committee.—The Bill was read a second time and sent to a Select Committee.

For the purposes of this provision, in the case of a local government area being a parish not having a parish council, parochial electors shall be substituted for members of the parish council, and the parish meeting shall be substituted for the parish council. Women shall be capable of being nominated as such additional members, and the scheme shall provide for the inclusion of some women amongst the members so nominated. (5) Every scheme prepared under this section shall be submitted to the Board of Education, and shall be approved by the Board if they are satisfied that proper inquiries have been made before preparing the scheme, and that an opportunity has been given to persons interested in the matter for expressing their views on any scheme so prepared, and that the scheme is within the powers given by this section. On the approval of a scheme by the Board of Education, the scheme shall have effect as if enacted by this Act. (6) If, after obtaining information for the purpose of a scheme under this section, the council of a county having a popula- tion according to the last census of less than sixty-five thousand, pass a resolution that a scheme is not necessary in their case having regard to the special circum- stances of their county, and make a special report on the subject to the Board of AS IT LEFT THE LORDS. of election of the local education com- mittees, and the powers and duties to be delegated to them. Provided that such a committee must be either- (a) a body, the ordinary members of which are elected for the purpose in manner provided in the scheme by the local government parochial electors for the delega- tion area. women being capable of being elected; or or (b) a body, the ordinary members of which consist of the council of a local government area where that is possible owing to the delegation area being a single local govern- ment area; or (c) a body, the ordinary members of which consist wholly of members of the councils of such local government areas wholly or partly situated in the delegation area as the scheme directs, or partly of such members of councils and partly of members nominated in manner directed by the scheme : Provided that the nominated mem- bers do not exceed one-third of the total number of ordinary members. If provision is made for the purpose by the scheme, all or any of the members of the county council representing any electoral division wholly or partly situated within the delegation area residing in the area may be additional members of the local education committee in addition to the ordinary members. or Where the ordinary members of a local education committee are the council of a local government area, women may be appointed as additional members, and the scheme shall provided for some women (not exceeding in number one- fifth of the number of the ordinary members) being so appointed, and also where a local education committee consists partly of nominated members for some women being included amongst the members so nominated. (5) Every scheme prepared under this section shall be submitted to the Board of Education, and shall be approved by the Board if they are satisfied that proper inquiries have been made before pre- paring the scheme, and that an oppor- tunity has been given to persons interested in the matter for expressing their views on any scheme so prepared, and that the scheme is within the powers given by this section.

The Abp. of Canterbury dealt first with the Bill from the historical point of view. He regarded the Act of 1870 as a great and wise one, and its most marked feature was to supplement, not supplant, denominational education. The friends of denominational schools were invited to build new schools, and the Church of England spent £9,500,000 in that work. Those schools could not be taken away without violating public honour and the best traditions of English life. He never deprecated popular control, but it was not to be exercised in only one direction. In the provided schools, many of them Church schools where careful religious teaching was now imparted, no religious teaching whatever would be given under the Bill. He asked that there should be religious teaching in their schools, given by men who believed what they said, that definite religious teaching must be accessible to children whose parents desired it, and that teachers who had spent the best part of their lives in giving that definite teaching should not be silenced.-The Duke of Norfolk (C.) condemned the Bill as insidious and far-reaching, and not in the interest of the country as a whole. He assented reluctantly to the 2nd R., but declared, as a Catholic, that the Bill must be drastically amended. Aug. 1. The Duke of Devonshire (L.U.) assented to the 2nd R., because the Bill had been passed by large majorities in the other House, and hoped the Govt. would make concessions. He accepted the principle of public control, but there were various forms of exercising it. In 1902 Parliament enacted public control, but took securities for maintaining the denominational character of the schools; and this Bill made no difference in the principle. Some parts of the Bill were extremely complicated, but the first clause had an appearance of simplicity. The Bill gave a preference to Cowper-Temple teaching over any other form. If Roman Catholics and Jews could not be expected to accept it, why should it be considered good enough for others. It was unreasonable and intolerable to force such a system on those who disagreed with it. He hoped that real facilities would be given for denominational teaching in the transferred schools; but all provided schools ought to be on the same footing in regard to religious teaching as well as secular teaching. He asked why the Govt. were going to disturb schools which were doing good work, and he deprecated any attempt to leaving to them the responsibility of passing a Bill which would lead to widespread agitation.-The Bp. of Southwark said the Govt. proposed to pull down one-half of the present system, and then appealed to those who had supported it to assist in the work of destruction. The Bill offered nothing like a compromise, but would plunge them deeper into difficulties.-Lord Stanley of Alderley (L.) said that the reason for the Bill was that the schools were to become municipal, and not ecclesiastical, institutions. The Nonconformists asked for no privilege, partiality, or favour.-The Bp. of London asserted that the Church had brought in the Bible before any Nonconformist bodies were established; but they would not accept the Bible edited by the county councils. Teaching in the voluntary schools had been carried on for 90 years in England at a cost to it of £10,000 a week. Now in no single school would a parent be able to claim the right to have religion taught to his children. Cowper-Temple teaching was not accepted as satisfactory religious teaching, and would throw an apple of discord into every municipal election.-Lord Tweedmouth (L.) denied that there was any attempt to attack the Church of England or to give preference to Nonconformists. -Lord Cawdor (C.) believed that this was a political Bill, and that Mr. Birrell&apos;s declaration that there would be complete public control over elementary schools, and that the wishes of the parents should be consulted as to the kind of religion they wished to have taught had been over-ruled by some evil influence. Aug. 2. Lord Halsbury (C.) asserted that the Bill would be disastrous to the Church schools, and that while the conscience of every one else was considered, that of Churchmen was ignored. It could not settle the religious difficulty. Denominational schools had prospered for 35 years under the eyes of inspectors and now their distinctive character was to be changed. He believed the House would not be deterred by threats from throwing out the Bill, if necessary.-Lord Fitzmaurice (L.) claimed that Parliament had the right to interfere with trusts and the schools. He justified making distinction between urban and rural schools and welcomed the severest examination later on in Committee. It contained nothing hostile to religion; the people were a religious people and local authorities would not carry on an anti-religious campaign. -The Bp. of Winchester looked with grave apprehension to the future of voluntary schools and the maintenance of their privileges as to the teaching of religion.-The Bp. of Hereford would trust the local authorities to discharge their duties of common Christian citizenship in education. The Bill was an honest attempt to solve a com- plicated and burning question.-The Bp. of Birmingham said the country did not &quot; &quot;82 HOUSE OF LORDS. mitred abbots under Henry VIII, they were reduced to the twenty-six bishops- being then a minority of the House, which about that time included fifty-nine tem- poral peers. Their number in the first Parliament of his predecessor had been only twenty-nine. Under the Union with Ireland, the Irish bishops sat by rotation in the House, but they were excluded by the Irish Church Act of 1869. At present, twenty-four English bishops sit as barons, the junior bishops above that number for the time being having no seats. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York, and the Bishops of London, Durham, and Winchester are always members of the House. It has been supposed that the bishops&apos; baronies arise from the tenure of their lands; the analogy, however, of other European kingdoms in early times favours the idea that the magnates of the Church were admitted to the national councils in virtue of their ecclesiastical dignities. THE LORDS TEMPORAL. The Lords Temporal comprise the dignities of duke, marquess, earl, viscount, and baron. The ducal title, although one of great importance in earlier times, was first recognized in England by the creation of the Black Prince as Duke of Cornwall by Edward III. The rank of marquess is originally derived from the office of governor and custodian of the marches or borders, and bears date as a title from the reign of Richard II. The earls derive their name from the Danish eorle, signi- fying &amp;quot;noble by birth&amp;quot; (May), which was used as a title of dignity prior to the Norman Conquest. After that date the alternative title of count came into use until the revival of the original title. The rank of viscount also dates back to remote times, and was used to distinguish the degree next subordinate to count. The title, however, was not conferred in England until the reign of Henry VI. The rank of baron is the oldest dignity in the peerage, as the title is to be found in the records of the Saxon dynasties. Under the feudal system following the Conquest, the barons became the tenants in capite of the King, and were so sum- moned, as before stated, to Parliament. The oldest English baronies now existent are those of de Ros and Le Despencer, both dating from December 24th, 1264; but an Irish barony, Kingsale, was con- ferred by Henry II in 1181, and confirmed by subsequent kings in 1223 and 1397. THE HEREDITARY SYSTEM. The unlimited power of the Crown to add to the House of Lords has at times been looked upon as dangerous to its inde- pendence. As long, however, as a peerage is necessarily hereditary, the permanence of the creation and the necessary succes- sion of an heir who will be wholly inde- pendent, would restrain a Sovereign or Minister from any very lavish exercise of this power. In the reign of Queen Anne, the Ministry of Harley and Bolingbroke created twelve peers at once, to overcome the opposition to the Government in the House of Lords. After the accession of the House of Hanover, this opposition became the dominant party, and proposed, by the Peerage Bill of 1719, to make such abuse of power impossible for the future, by prohibiting all future creations except on the extinction of existing perages. This Bill was rejected by the House of Commons, as calculated to convert the House of Lords into a clan oligarchy, severed from the rest of the nation, and no similar proposal has ever been renewed. The action, however, against which it was directed has never ben repeated, though threats of the kind were thrown out at the time of the Reform struggle of 1832. The House of Lords is sometimes rather invidiously referred to as consisting wholly of great landowners. They necessarily form its majority, and it is well that they should thus be secured an organ in the State. But among its most prominent and active members are many who have been themselves raised to the peerage for public services or professional eminence. Of its present members, about one-fourth have had experience as members of the House of Commons. It is constantly recruited from the ablest men of the time (as is shown by the fact that only about one-fourth of the existing peers sit by virtue of peerages dating before 1800), from the law, the army, the navy, and the professional and commercial classes; so that a seat in the House is a possible inheritance for the descendant of any English family. Its constitutional position was well understood by the member of the House of Commons who said, with refer- ence to the Peerage Bill of 1719, that while he had himself no aspiration to a Peerage, he would never bar his remote posterity from the chance of attaining to it. Those who constantly protest against any exercise of its powers in rejecting or modifying the decisions of a majority of the House of Commons, may be fairly challenged, unless they advocate the un- limited power of a single Chamber, to produce a solution of that most difficult of political problems, how to create a new Upper Chamber for the first time. The late Lord Beaconsfield&apos;s speech at Man- chester in 1872 well illustrates the advan- tages afforded by the House of Lords, as &quot; &quot;238 MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES, 1885 1907. *Dalmeny, Lord C., Bt..

THE CONSTITUTIONAL YEAR BOOK was first issued in 1885, with the special object of supplying a demand which had often been made by Conservative speakers and writers, and by politicians generally, for a cheap and handy reference-book of political information, containing facts and statistics of public interest, such as are often only obtainable after laborious search among Parliamentary Blue Books and other official documents. The success which attended its issue has justified the continuance of the publication in an enlarged and improved form. The Constitutional Year Book does not claim to compete in variety of general information with the numerous and valuable Almanacks at present in circulation. While, however, its scope is chiefly political, there will be found in its pages much of the informa- tion usually contained in an Almanack, in addition to features which are believed to distinguish it from any existing work of the kind. Special attention is drawn to the complete information relating to Parliamentary Constituencies, Members, Candidates, and Elections from 1885 to the present time; to the Parliamentary Summary in a special and convenient form; to the statistics bearing on the General Election of 1906; and to the condensed Tables of Statistics on almost every subject of national importance, which have been carefully revised and brought down to the latest possible date. The Editor will be glad to receive any suggestions or corrections from correspondents. &quot; &quot;17 LANDMARKS IN GENERAL HISTORY. Creation of the World (Eng.

C-India-*FINANCIAL STATEMENT-continued. for 1904-5 a surplus of three millions, and for 1905-6 a surplus of £1,800,000. The estimated surplus for 1906-7 was £800,000. Reductions had been made in the salt tax, but it could not, however, be dispensed with altogether. Railways, canals, and forests gave a net revenue of more than five millions, and railways were progressing at the rate of 1,000 miles a year. The State forests were a splendid asset, and India had no great national debt. The gross debt was 214 millions, but 154 millions repre- sented reproductive works. As to trade, all was well with India. Parts of India were poor and unprogressive, but others were very prosperous, and the condition of the people was improving. The prosperity of India depended upon her exports, and preference to the mother country could not but cause injury to India. The military expenditure was £18,700,000, a heavy burden. Lord Kitchener&apos;s scheme of army organization was not yet ripe for discussion, but it did not aim at increasing the army. At present he did not propose to pledge himself to any line. The government of India had been called an insoluble problem, and the man who dogmatized about it was a mere simpleton. He thought it would be wise to advance further on the path of improvement in governmental methods, and he was not frightened by what was said at the Indian Congress. Dissatisfaction did not necessarily mean disaffection. English institutions could not be transplanted wholesale into India, but that was no reason for folding our hands and doing nothing. The question of extending the representative element in the Legislative Council was to be considered, and access to the higher administrative offices would be given to competent Indians.-Mr. K. Hardie moved an amendment in favour of placing the salary of the Secretary of State on the Estimates. -This, after debate, was rejected by 153 to 89, and the usual formal financial resolution was passed. July 20. C-Ireland.-ADMINISTRATION.-In the debate on the Address Col. Saunderson (C.) moved an amendment expressing alarm that the Govt. proposed to effect changes in the system of Irish government leading to a policy which would endanger the liberties and property of the loyalist minority, promote discord and strife, and impair the integrity of the United Kingdom. His object, he said, was to elicit from the Govt. a statement as to what was meant by their proposed legislation. Home Rule, he said, would mean Rome Rule, and Nonconformists should consider this carefully.— Mr. J. Devlin (N.) denounced the political action of the Ulster Unionist party.— Mr. T. W. Russell (L.) saw nothing to be alarmed at in the Speech from the Throne. Mr. Bryce (L.), Chief Secy. for Ireland, said the Speech from the Throne contained nothing new respecting Ireland. There was a great deal to be done in the way of cheapening and improving administration. He, himself, was a Home Ruler before 1886, and he had not abandoned the principle. The Govt. were considering what should be done, and the tranquil state of Ireland would justify an effort in the direction of improving the government and associating the people with it. No con- stitutional Govt. could always resist the demand of the Irish people.-Mr. Long (C.) said that changes could be made in the educational system and other matters, without interfering with the Union. The Opposition wished to know whether the Govt. were about to begin a policy of &amp;quot;Home Rule by instalments.&amp;quot; They had, possibly with too great haste, relinquished their powers under the Crimes Act. In the general election it was understood that the Liberal party had no intention of raising the Home Rule question, and it would be unfair for them to claim that they had a mandate to raise it.—Mr. Dillon (N.) said the Nationalists were willing to give the Govt. time to give effect to their policy.-Mr. J. Chamberlain (L.U.) said the Govt. was a Home Rule Govt. Their policy might be insidious, but it was a Home Rule policy.-The amendment was rejected by 406 to 88. Feb. 21. Mr. Delany (N.) moved that the jurisdiction of Judges in dealing with contempt of Court ought to be defined and limited.-Mr. Barrie (C.) described the resolution as an attempt to prejudice the Irish judiciary in the eyes of the people.-Mr. Cherry (L.), Atty. Genl. for Ireland, admitted that the law of contempt had been pushed exce tion- ally far and needed amendment. There should be a right of appeal, indefinite committals should be prohibited, and it should be made possible for the Crown to pardon offenders. In addition rules ought to be laid down for the better treatment of persons who were committed. It would not be possible to bring in a measure this year. The closure having been agreed to, the resolution was carried. April 4. On the motion for the Easter adjournment, Mr. Long, in the first place, raised the question of the employment of temporary Sub-Commissioners under the Land Act, and charged the Executive with having acted arbitrarily and cruelly to certain officials whose services had been dispensed with abruptly.-Mr. J. Redmond (N.) claimed that Sub-Commissioners ought to possess the confidence of Irish farmers and not to be &quot; &quot;LOCAL GOVERNMENT.-PARISH AND DISTRICT COUNCILS. 273 Disqualification does not apply to a person selling or leasing land or lending money to the council or board, nor to contracts for supplying stone, gravel, &amp;amp;c, from his own laud for road repairs, nor to the transport of such material for such repairs in his neighbourhood; nor do s it apply to persons interested in newspapers which insert advertisements relating to council or board, nor to shareh lders in joint stock companies holding contracts, but they must not vote on any matter in which the company is interested. ELECTION OF PARISH COUNCILLORS. (a) NOMINATION OF CANDIDATES. At the parish meeting the chairman shall call for nomination papers to be handed to him, and number them as they are handed in, in the order in which he receives them. Form of nomination paper may be obtained free from the Returning Officer, the overseers, or from the Clerk to the Parish Council. The nomination paper should be filled up as a matter of precaution before the parish meeting. It must be signed by two parochial electors of the parish, and no more, as proposer and seconder. Each candidate must be nominated by a separate nomination paper; the same proposer or seconder may sign as many papers as there are candidates to be elected, but no more, for the parish, or ward (if there are wards). When all the nomination papers have been received, and not less than fifteen minutes has elapsed since the chairman took the chair, he shall read out the names of all the duly nominated candidates alphabetically, with their addresses and descrip- tions, and the names and addresses of their proposers and seconders. After this has been done, no further nominations can be received, except to replace candidates who may withdraw their names. The chairman&apos;s decision that a nomination paper is valid is final; but if he decides that any paper is invalid, he must write and sign his reasons for so deci ling, and inform the meeting thereof. After the nominations are read out, questions may be put to candidates, and explanations given by them. Candidates may withdraw their candidature before the names are put to the meeting, either in writing or by word of mouth, and in such event, if any elector desires it, an opportunity must be given for further nominations to be made. (b) THE ELECTION. The number of parish councillors for each parish is fixed by the County Council. If the candidates validly nominated are not more in number than the number of councillors to be elected, the chairman declares them all duly elected. If, however, the nominations are in excess of the number of councillors, the chair- man will put each name to the meeting in its alphabetical order, and will take a vote by show of hands in favour of each candidate. The votes will be counted and the number in favour of each declared. If no poll is demanded, he will declare those to be elected who have obtained the largest number of votes. One-third of the electors present, or five electors, whichever number is least, may demand a poll to be taken, and if such demand be made and not withdrawn before the close of the meeting (ten minutes being given for the purpose), a poll will be taken as shewn below. If no poll is demanded, the declaration of the chairman, as to the result of the election, will be generally final, subject to an election petition (if any). (c) THE POLL. If a poll is demanded, the chairman shall send the names of the candidates and the nomination papers to the Returning Officer, and shall also send notice to each candi- date that he has been nominated and that a poll has been demanded. At any time, not later than twelve o&apos;clock, on Tuesday following Thursday after the Parish meeting for the election, a candidate may withdraw his candidature by giving written notice to the Returning Officer, and if the withdrawal of one or more names renders it unnecessary to take a poll, the Returning Officer declares the remaining candidates duly elected. If a poll is taken the Returning Officer gives five clear days&apos; notice, and the pro- ceedings are conducted in a similar manner to those at a Parliamentary election, the votes being taken by ballot. The poll shall take place on the first Monday in April, or, if that is Easter Monday, the last Monday in March; or in either case, such other day, not being earlier than the preceding Saturday or later than the following Wednesday, as may be decided by the County Council. &quot; &quot;INLAND REVENUE DUTIES-continued. 477 EXCISE DUTIES (contd.).

Feb. 21. C-Old-Age Pensions.-Mr. O&apos;Grady (Lab.) moved a resolution in favour of pro- viding, out of public funds, for old-age pensions.—Mr. Asquith (L.), Chan. of Exchr., said he sympathised with those who desired this reform; but the subject called for patience and prudence, and he was unable to provide the necessary funds. The Govt. was pledged to retrenchment, and speedy and substantial steps ought to be made to effect economy in the Army and Navy, as well as other services, including education, and by the re-adjustment of taxation (without any return to protection). In regard to expenditure the House of Commons was the worst offender. He was asked in one week to frank members&apos; letters; to provide free meals for underfed school children; to pay the expenses of returning officers at elections; and to pay every member of Parliament £300 a year. Social reforms involved increased expen- diture, and the relative urgency of each question must be considered.-Mr. Arnold- Forster (L.U.) asked whether the Govt. had any scheme in view for old-age pensions.—Mr. Burns (Lab.), Pres. Local Govt. Bd., said that in his judgment the best scheme would be to give every one 5s. a week at 65 years of age, excluding men in receipt of military, naval, civil, or municipal pensions. The Poor Law Commission would soon report, and the Govt. would then have sufficient information to justify making a beginning.-The resolution was carried. March 14. ORANGE RIVER COLONY.-See under AFRICA, S. C-Payment of Members. Mr. Lever (L.) moved that all members of Parliament ought to be paid by the State at the rate of £300 per annum. He estimated the cost at about £200,000 a year.-Mr. Vivian (Lab.) seconded.-Sir H. Kimber (C.) moved an amendment that the House had no power to appropriate the taxpayers&apos; money to the personal use and benefit of its members.-Mr. E. Cecil (C.) argued that a salaried member might be tempted to vote against his convictions, whenever he believed that an honest vote would jeopardize his livelihood.-Mr. Atherley-Jones (L.) contended that organized labour could return an adequate number of representatives without payment. £30,000 would pay the expenses of as many members as labour was reason- ably entitled to.-Mr. J. Ward (Lab.) looked forward to a great increase in their numbers, and an educated democracy would insist upon payment.-Sir E. Clarke (C.) urged that county and borough councils, boards of guardians, and county and borough magistrates, could equally claim to be paid. Labour members might receive freely given aid from the trade unions rather than exact pay from the reluctant tax- payers. The Nationalist party would be endowed with £24,000 a year.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman said the Govt. agreed with the principle of payment for members, but the time was not opportune as money was wanting. A moderate allowance would secure genuine and straightforward representation. Money played too large a part in the existing system. At present neither the time nor money was available.-Mr. J. Redmond (N.) said the Irish members had never asked for payment out of public funds, being supported by the voluntary contributions of their countrymen, and would be ready to forego the payment now contemplated if it were made.—The amendment was rejected by 363 to 110, and the motion was carried by a majority of 238. March 7. C_*Plural Voting Bill.-Mr. Harcourt (L.), First Commr. of Works, introduced the Govt. Bill for the abolition of plural voting. He said it proposed to penalise a Parliamentary elector, registered in more than one constituency, who should vote in any constituency except that which he might select for the purpose. It would leave to each elector all the voting qualifications which he possessed at present, but it would limit their exercise. It abolished the capricious multiplication of electoral power arising from the distribution of real estate. A plural voter would be able to select once in 12 months which vote he would exercise during the subsequent year, and the selection would hold good afterwards unless cancelled.-Sir W. Anson (L.U.) said that such an important Bill should not have been introduced under the 10 minutes&apos; rule. The change, to be considered seriously, ought to be part of a large scheme of redistribution.-Leave to bring in the Bill was granted by 327 to 65, and it was read a first time. May 2. On the 2nd R., Mr. H. W. Forster (C.) moved an amendment declining to consider a change in the franchise, unaccompanied by a removal of the serious existing anomalies in the distribution of electoral power.-Mr. Morrell (L.) said that plural voting was a class privilege. The nation consisted of men and women, not of houses and estates.--Mr. Arnold-Forster (L,U.) described the zeal for electoral purity &quot; &quot; The date shows when this volume was taken.

It the Bill.-Lord Lansdowne said that the clause was a perfectly defensible one. proposed the creation of that variety in schools which many wished to see, but he feared that it would overload the Bill.-The Archbishop withdrew the clause.-Cl. 15 (Part II. of the Bill), dealing with schemes of delegation, was then discussed.—An amendment by Lord Belper to provide that the powers should be delegated to &amp;quot;the local education committees,&amp;quot; was carried by 99 to 31.-The clause was passed, also Cl. 16. Nov. 20. Clauses up to No. 23 were added to the Bill.--On Cl. 24 (vacation schools, health of children, and bursaries in elementary schools), Lord Jersey (C.) proposed that the local education authority might encourage and assist the continuance of voluntary agencies, and include representatives of voluntary associations.-Agreed to.-Lord Belper moved to omit the provision for the medical inspection of children on admission.. -Withdrawn after debate.-On Cl. 25 (abolition of a register of teachers), Lord Monks- well moved that a registration council should be constituted with the duty of keeping a register of qualified teachers.-Agreed to.-On Cl. 26, Part III. (establishment of a Welsh Council), Lord Cawdor moved its rejection, arguing that the control by Parlia- ment had been abolished, and that of the Treasury substituted. The clause was a step towards Home Rule for Wales. Nov. 21. Lord Crewe replied that the Welsh people were, as a whole, in favour of such a Council, and that ample precautions had been taken to secure the control of Parliament over it. He agreed to substitute the control of the Board of Education for that of the Treasury. To talk about Home Rule in this connection it was Unionism gone mad.-Lord St. Aldwyn asserted that the clause was framed in the spirit and with a desire for Home Rule. The rights of the minority were disregarded.-The clause was struck out by 109 to 44.-The Bill subsequently pissed Report stage. Nov. 22. On Report, numerous amendments were considered.-Lord Lansdowne reviewed the Lords&apos; amendments as a whole and justified them in detail.-Lord Crewe replied that the essential character of the Bill had been changed.-On Cl. 2, the Duke of Devon- shire moved to entrust to the Commission under the Bill larger powers than were given in the Bill.-Lord Crewe said the local authority would rather hire a school than build a new one, and that was the great safeguard of the denominational schools.— Agreed to.-On Cl. 3 (ordinary facilities for special religious instruction), Lord Salisbury moved to strike out words which restricted the facilities.-Carried by 143 to 43.-Lord St. Aldwyn moved that the special facilities under Cl. 3 should be afforded on two mornings a week in school hours, instead of five.-Carried by 142 to 23, the Bishops being divided.-Lord Salisbury proposed a new clause that, where children could not conveniently attend, the local authority should, so far as reasonably prac- ticable, provide religious instruction.-Agreed to.-Lord Londonderry proposed to substitute the parents of &amp;quot; two-thirds&amp;quot; of the children desiring facilities for the parents of a &amp;quot;majority&amp;quot; of the children.-Agreed to.-It was next moved to add the words &amp;quot;whose parents take part in the ballot.&amp;quot;-Carried by 97 to 47. Nov. 29. Lord Lansdowne moved on Cl. 4 (extended facilities for special religious instruction) that suitable provision shall be made, in the school or elsewhere, for children of parents who declared their objection to the facilities for religious instruction of the character permitted under the Act of 1870.-The Bp. of Hereford said the proposal would turn the Bill upside down.-Lord Ripon said it was out of the question that the Govt. could entertain it.-Lord Crewe said he was prepared on the 3rd R. to see whether any hardships could be dealt with.-The amendment was carried by 131 to 45.-Clause agreed to.-Cl. 5 (appeals to the Bd. of Education) was struck out on the motion of Lord Crewe. Cl. 6 (provision of new schools with facilities for special religious instruction) was agreed to.-The Bp. of London moved a new clause providing opportunities for the inspection of religious instruction.-Accepted.-Cls. 7 and 8 were also passed.-Cl. 9 (power to obtain schemes with respect to voluntary school buildings held under trust), the words limiting the guarantee to &amp;quot;five years struck out.—An amendment by the Duke of Devonshire that where the local education authority had declined to make an arrangement with the owners of an existing voluntary school, the latter might apply to the Commission to make a scheme under which it should be carried on as a provided school. The rights of parents and of the owners could not, he contended, be left to the uncontrolled discretion of the local. authorities.-Lord Crewe refused to accept the principle that any school, however redundant, should be forced upon the local authority. The Govt. could not admit that a yoluntary school as such had any claim against a local authority.-Amendment agreed to. Clauses up to No. 26 were passed, and Report was completed. &amp;quot;&amp;quot; were Dec. 3. On the 3rd R., Lord Crewe moved to amend Cl. 1 by leaving it to the Bd. of Education to appoint a date later than 1st July, 1908, for the Act to come into local operation.— &quot; &quot;PARLIAMENTARY SUMMARY, 1906. 341 C-Sugar Convention.—Mr. A. H. Scott (L.) moved a resolution in favour of with- drawal from the Brussels Sugar Convention.-Sir J. Dickson-Poynder (L.) moved an amendment that, as the Convention was binding for five years, it was not expedient to announce any decision at present.-Lord Percy (C.) asserted that the Convention had not raised prices, and that the consumer must gain by its continuance.—Mr. Ll-George (L.), Pres. Bd. of Trade, held that the resolution ought not to be passed at present. Mr. J. Chamberlain condemned the Govt. severely for not declaring their policy, as the indecision must cause insecurity. The country had not lost a penny by the Convention, which was a measure of justice to our sugar-producing Colonies.- Sir H. C.-Bannerman said that those who had fastened the Convention on the English people ought not to charge the Govt. with irresolution for not denouncing it pre- maturely.-Resolution and amendment withdrawn. March 27. C-*Supply.-CHAIRMAN.-In Committee of Supply, Mr. Emmott was voted to the TEMPORARY COMMISSIONS.-On the Supplementary Civil Service Estimates, 1905-6, a discussion arose upon the expenses of the Redistribution Committee of 1905.— Mr. Burns undertook to publish the Report. SUNDAY TRADING.-See under LABOUR. Chair. FOREIGN OFFICE.-On vote for diplomatic expenses Sir E. Grey explained that the estimate was necessary for the work of delimiting the Anglo-German boundary at Lake Victoria. Mr. Cox (L.) opposed the grant of compensation to French fishermen on the treaty shore of Newfoundland. It should, he said, be paid by the Colony.- Sir E. Grey said the payment was settled in 1905. The Colony had been treated very generously. Feb. 27. Feb. 28. DEPUTY-CHAIRMAN.—Mr. Caldwell (L.) was elected Deputy-Chairman. A VOTE ON ACCOUNT for the Civil Service and Revenue Departments, 1906-7, was discussed, in the course of which several subjects were raised, among them being the administration of the Factory Acts.-Mr. Trevelyan (L.) also called attention to the administration of the Aliens Act by the Home Office, and said he feared that genuine political refugees from Russia were being kept out of the country without justification. -Mr. Gladstone defended the Home Office regulations. In regard to crime the operation of the Aliens Act was satisfactory. The traditions of the country on the question of asylum for political refugees would be fully maintained. He also promised to consider the questions of the inspection of conventual laundries, and vivisection and other matters.—Sir E. Grey, replying to questions on the Sugar Convention, said that we could not withdraw before 1908, and notice of withdrawal would be necessary. The settlement of policy was, therefore, neither pressing or urgent.-Some other topics were briefly discussed, and the vote was agreed to. March 5. The House was occupied for some hours in discussing the Civil Service Estimates, considerable time being devoted to the Privy Council vote and the salary of the President. April 26. The Foreign Office Vote was discussed, July 5, and questions relating to China, Russia, Egypt, &amp;amp;c. Further details of the discussions in Supply are contained under specific headings.——- The Report on Supply was closured and all outstanding votes passed on Aug. 1. TRADE DISPUTES BILLS.-See under LABOUR. TRANSVAAL.-See under AFRICA, S. TRUCK ACTS.-See under LABOUR. L-Turkey.-CUSTOMS.-Lord Newton called attention to the increased Customs duties. July 2. C-EGYPT.-Sir E. Grey (L.), Foreign Secy., said that negotiations were pending with Turkey as to the occupation of Tabah, on the Sinai Peninsula, which had been recognised as being under the administration of Egypt. Aggression upon Egypt administration could not be allowed to continue. March 27. L-Lord Fitzmaurice stated that in view of the unrest in Egypt, due to the action of Turkey in connection with the frontier, it had been decided to reinforce the garrison. The demands by the Turks had made it necessary that there should be a delimitation of the frontier, and meanwhile that the Turkish forces should retire. May 1. C-DENSHAWAI EXECUTIONS.-This subject was discussed on June 28, July 2 &amp;amp; 5. C-Sir E. Grey announced that a Note had been presented to the Porte respecting the frontier dispute in the Sinai Peninsula, pressing the demand for delimitation. The Turkish claim, if admitted, would constitute a real danger to the freedom of the Suez Canal and to the liberties of Egypt and the Khedive. It had been resolved to press for a settlement of the frontier as it had long existed undisturbed. May 7. Sir E. Grey stated that a satisfactory Note had been received from the Turkish Govt., that Tabah and other places near had been evacuated, and that a joint com- mission would be appointed to fix the boundaries. H.M. Govt. accepted this as a &quot; &quot;PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION LAW. 265 OFFENCES. Treating, continued-Treating the wives or relations of electors may constitute the offence. The quantity of refreshment provided is immaterial if the intention is corrupt. The gift of tickets to be ex- changed for refreshment is equivalent to direct treating. The person accepting any meat, drink, or entertainment, is also guilty and punishable accordingly. Undue Influence. -This offence con- sists- (a) In using or threatening force or re- straint to induce any elector to vote or not to vote at the election. (b) In inflicting upon or threatening any temporal or spiritual injury against a voter with the same purpose. (c) In abducting an elector, or fraudu- lently preventing, or interfering with him in giving his vote freely. The withdrawal of custom or employ- ment is undue influence, if done with the view of affecting the elector&apos;s vote. A threat to evict a tenant with the same object comes within the definition of undue influence. Personation.-Any person who applies for a ballot paper in the name of another, whether living or dead, or of a fictitious person, is guilty of personation. Voting twice at the same election is the same as personation. Aiding or abetting personation is equi- valent to personation itself. Forging or counterfeiting a ballot paper is an offence punishable as a mis- demeanour PENALTIES. The same as for bribery. The same as for bribery. To the offender, imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years with hard labour. Seven years&apos; incapacity to be elect- ed, to vote or to hold any public office. If committed by any agent of a can- didate, the latter loses his seat if elected. (B) ILLEGAL PRACTICES.

C-Education-*EDUCATION BILL-continued. and that efficiency and economy forbade wholesale experiments in denominational instruction. If a right was to be given to any one denomination, it must be given to all. The Cowper-Temple clause was put into the Act of 1870 at the instance of Anglicans against the wishes of the Nonconformists. It was Churchmen who forced Bible teaching into the syllabuses, and they could not turn round now and say that Bible teaching was Nonconformity. &amp;quot;Clericalism was the enemy,&amp;quot; and the issue before the country could not be bridged over. No ecclesiastic or politician must stand between the child and the light radiating from the Bible.-Sir W. Anson (L.U.) continued the criticism of the Bill, and deplored the wanton interference with a settlement that was working well except where it was disturbed for political purposes. The Bill would not solve the religious difficulty. The Opposition insisted that definite religious instruction should be given during school hours, and if beaten in Parliament they would not abandon the struggle.-Mr. Lough (L.), Secy. Bd. of Education, said the Bill was a simple and moderate Education Bill, and the supporters of the voluntary schools should be grateful to the Govt. for relieving them of financial obligations. 66 May 8. Mr. Bryce (L.) said that no burden was imposed on the Church, that the Bill offered fair terms to voluntary schools, but that distinctive religious teaching would no longer be given by the regular teachers. Local authorities would act in a generous spirit and would give facilities for such instruction. The endowment clauses were not intended to divert modern denominational endowments. Much of the funds con- tributed for voluntary schools had been subscribed to escape a rate. He denied that Cowper-Temple teaching was the same thing as Nonconformity. It was merely a direction to teach Protestantism, or codenominationalism.&amp;quot; All the objections now made were made in 1870, but the good sense of Englishmen had overcome them.- Mr. Dillon (N.) warned the Labour members that, if they aroused Catholic hostility, they might lose Nationalist co-operation. Roman Catholics would never accept a system of simple Bible teaching. Cl. 4 ought to be made to apply to their schools, and they should have their own teachers.-Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that Mr. Dillon&apos;s demands would absolutely destroy the Bill as regards public control and tests for teachers. He denied that a mandate had been given except for the removal of the supposed grievance of Nonconformists, who disliked paying rates for denomina- tional instruction. To remedy the grievance the Govt. were shifting it from the Nonconformists on to others, and endowing a special form of religion, already largely endowed, with a million a year. The consciences of Anglicans were hurt by the Bill, as the Nonconformist conscience was hurt by the Act of 1902. Any concessions to the Roman Catholics must also be given to Anglicans. Public control of secular education was accepted by all, but such control of religious instruction was contrary to the old principles of the Free Churches, and was, moreover, control in a most unfair way. If clericalism was the enemy,&amp;quot; it must be extended to other sects as well as the Church; but it was not, and he trusted it never would be here. The Bill would not be a final settlement, for it was distasteful to practically one-half of the population.- Mr. F. E. Smith (C.) described the Bill as neither a compromise nor a concordat, but a brutal dictation of terms. May 9. ። Mr. J. Redmond (N.) said the Nationalists would vote against the 2nd R., as the Bill contravened their fundamental principles, and Cowper-Temple religion, was abhorrent to them. Protestant teachers should never be put into Catholic schools, or Christian teachers into Jewish schools, nor should Catholics be at the mercy of local authorities composed of cranks and bigots.-Mr. Asquith (L.), Chan. of Exchr., said that public control and the abolition of tests could only be brought about by the Govt. plan. In transferring the management to public care there would be no interference with property. An adequate rent would be paid for a transferred school, and the fabric would be maintained by the local authority. The trustees might have facilities for providing denominational instruction as a compulsory part of the bargain. The Commission would deal with intractable trustees. The teachers would have power to give religious instruction under the Cowper-Temple clause, which did not attempt to exclude dogmatic teaching in the widest sense, but prevented rate aid for creeds and formularies. The clause had worked well for 35 years. It could be supplemented at home, or in the Sunday school. Parents had no inalienable right to have their children taught particular creeds at the expense of the State. The alternative to the Bill was secular teaching. The unlimited right of entry was fantastic and repugnant, and would erect a set of sectarian pens in every school. The secular scheme, though logical and practicable, was opposed by the vast majority of English parents. Mr. Healy (N.) appealed to the House to treat the Roman Catholics with greater generosity. The Bill otherwise would be a Nonconformist Act of Conformity. &quot; &quot;INDEX. xi (NOTE.-The Parliamentary Summary, Lists of Public Bills, Parliamentary Papers, etc., being arranged in alphabetical order, the various items are not separately inserted in the general index.

INDIA OFFICE (Downing Street, S.W.) is presided over by a Secretary of State (changing with the Ministry) as- sisted by one Permanent and one Parlia- mentary Under-Secretary, and by a Council composed originally of fifteen members having Indian experience; the number, however, is now eleven, and will be reduced to ten on the occurrence of a vacancy. The members of Council are appointed by the Secretary of State, are ineligible to be elected to Parliament, and hold office for ten years, but a member may for special reasons be continued in office for a further period of five years. The major part of them must consist of persons who have resided in India at least ten years, and who have not left India more than ten years previously to their appointment. The &quot;Secretary of State in Council&quot; is charged with such superintendence of the Government of India as is entrusted to him by the Government of India Act of 1858. The precise relations between the India Office and the Governor-General of India, and between the Secretary of State and his Council, are somewhat difficult to explain, being regulated by the Act of 1858 before-mentioned, which transferred the Government of India to the Crown, and vested the powers of the old Court of Directors of the East India Company in the Secretary of State for India in Council.

The information contained in the Parliamentary Papers appertains to every conceivable object of political and statistical interest. Besides Bills representing all the legislative projects of each session, and Returns specially relating to them, there are periodical statements of the working of different departments of the Government, of the results of recent legislation, Reports of Royal Commissions or of Committees of either House, Treaties, Correspondence with foreign countries or with our Colonies, Reports of diplomatic and consular agents abroad, Census and other returns, Statistics of all kinds, Accounts, Estimates, and many miscellaneous papers that cannot be included under any of the above heads.

They are numbered in a new series for each year. 2 Papers by Command include all such Reports, Papers, &amp;amp;c., as equally concern both Houses of Parliament. They are distinguished by the letters Cd., with numbers in brackets. The numbering runs for a series of years. 3 Reports and Papers. These comprise Reports, Returns, &amp;amp;c., specially ordered to be printed by either House, and sometimes afterwards communicated to the other House. They, also, are numbered in a fresh series for each year.

L. &quot; &quot;THE CONSTITUTION. 21 supports them against opposition, and rejects every motion which reflects on them or is likely to embarrass them. If they forfeit that confidence, or if the Parliamentary majority are dissatisfied with the way in which affairs are con- ducted, they have merely to declare that they have ceased to trust the Ministry, and to ask for a Ministry which they can trust. By the system of Party, an organ- ised body of men will be always found ready to succeed them; &amp;quot; His Majesty&apos;s Opposition&amp;quot; being as much a part of the polity as the Administration itself. The Cabinet holds its deliberations in secret, and the King&apos;s permission is necessary if any Minister desires to make public what has passel thereat. Mr. Gladstone, whose experience was unrivalled, held that the Privy Councillor&apos;s oath applied to its proceedings, and that no one was entitled even to make a note of them except the Prime Minister, who reports to the Sovereign. No official record minute of any kind is kept. The chief of the Cabinet is or THE PRIME MINISTER. Besides being a Privy Councillor, he usually, though not necessarily, holds the office of First Lord of the Treasury. He has no legal primacy over the other mem- bers of the Cabinet; this is, indeed, neces- sarily the case in a body which has itself no legal status.* The official precedence of the Prime Minister was not defined until 1905, when he was declared to rank next after the Archbishop of York. The Prime Minister is selected by the Sovereign, whose choice, among natural-born subjects, is nominally unrestrained, but is, in fact, limited to the leaders of the party which can command a majority in the House of Com- mons. When charged by the Sovereign with the task of forming an Administration, he proceeds to the selection of occupants for the various offices, and submits their names for the approval of the Crown. The old Constitutional maxim, that &amp;quot;the King can do no wrong,&amp;quot; is now literally true, for his acts are really the acts of his Ministers; and his Ministers are responsible to the House of Commons, not merely as of old for any breach of the law, but for the general course of their policy, which must accord with the opinions of the majority of that House, or else, in conformity with Constitutional usage, practically as bind- ing as a legal enactment, the Ministers are bound to resign office. THE SUCCESSION. - The Succession to the Crown is regu- lated by an Act of Parliament passed in A.D. 1701, and usually called the &amp;quot;Act of Settlement.&amp;quot; This Act limited the right of succession to the Princess Sophia of Hanover, grand-daughter of James I., and to her heirs, being Protestants. All the property which once formed the main revenue of the Crown is now treated as furnishing part of the general State revenues, and the management of it is directly controlled by Parliament. At the commencement of every reign, Parlia- ment fixes the yearly sum which shall be payable to the Crown for all expenses not directly of a public kind. (See under &amp;quot;The Civil List and Royal Grants; &apos; post.) THE SOVEREIGN AND PARLIAMENT. The King (acting by the advice of his Ministers) can prorogue Parliament when- ever he pleases, and no Parliament can be assembled, prorogued, or dissolved with- out his express command. He can also dissolve Parliament at his pleasure; but, since the passing of the Septennial Act in 1716, no Parliament can last longer than seven years. Its annual meeting is se- cured by the necessity of obtaining from it a grant for the yearly supplies. The assent of the Sovereign is indispensable for any Bill (or proposed law) to become actual law. The legislative power is vested primarily in the two Houses of Parliament. THE HOUSE OF LORDS. The House of Lords consists of the first and second Estates of the Realm, viz.: the Lords Spiritual and the Lords Temporal. It comprises a varying number of English peers (princes of the blood, dukes, mar- quises, earls, viscounts, and barons), two archbishops, 24 bishops, 16 representative peers for Scotland chosen for each Parlia- ment, and 28 representative peers for Ireland, elected for life. The Sovereign can make as many new peers as he chooses. His Ministers usually recommend (espec- ially at the time of their giving up office) the grant of peerages to some of their most active and distinguished supporters. When once a person has been summoned to Parliament to sit in the House of Lords, or has actually taken his seat, or when a person has been created a peer by the King&apos;s &amp;quot;letters patent,&amp;quot; his succeeding heirs inherit the right to sit, except in the case of certain law Lords created peers for life under the provisions of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876. Women cannot sit in the House of Lords, though women may be peeresses by Royal grant, or in a few cases even by descent. The Lord Chancellor, who is always, though not necessarily, a peer, presides over the debates in the House of Lords. Any bills can be proposed in the House of Lords &amp;quot;The Treaty of Berlin (1878) is the first European instrument which formally describes the Prime Minister of England by that title.&amp;quot;-Times, Nov. 11th, 1904. &quot; &quot;274 LOCAL GOVERNMENT. DISTRICT COUNCILS AND GUARDIANS. RURAL DISTRICT COUNCILS. I.-CONSTITUTION. The Rural District Council consists of a chairman and councillors. The councillors are elected by the parochial electors of those parishes or areas now electing guardians, and they are the representatives of that parish or area electing them on the Board of Guardians. The chairman is elected by the councillors. The chairman, as also a vice-chairman, and not more than two other persons qualified to be district councillors, may be elected by the councillors outside their own body, and from those who have been ex officio guardians. The term of office of councillors is three years, one-third as nearly as possible going out of office on the 15th of April in each year. By order of County Council they may retire simultaneously at end of the third year. The chairman of the Rural District Council, unless a woman, is ex officio a Justice of the Peace for the county. II. QUALIFICATION OF COUNCILLORS. A person qualified to be a councillor must be a parochial elector of some parish within the union, or have resided in the union during the whole of the twelve months preceding the election. No person is disqualified by sex or marriage; practically, therefore, any adult elector or resident in the union, of either sex, is qualified for election. Disqualifications are the same as those of parish councillors. referred to ante, but the disqualification is not removable as it is in certain cases of parish councillors, and certain further disqualifications as to guardians are applicable to rural district councillors. III. ELECTION OF RURAL DISTRICT COUNCILLORS. Notice of election must be published by returning officer (the clerk of the council). Candidates must be nominated as in case of parish councillors. Nomination papers, properly filled in, must be sent to the returning officer. Nomination papers may be obtained free from the returning officer or overseers. No parochial elector can sign nomination papers for more than the number of rural district councillors to be elected in any one parish or area. Returning officers deal with nomination papers, as the chairman does in the case of parish councillors. Candidates may withdraw their candidature by giving the pre- scribed notice. The number of rural district councillors is in each parish or area the same as the number of guardians. If the candidates validly nominated are not more in number than the number of councillors to be elected, the returning officer gives notice that no poll will be taken. If there is to be a poll, notice is given at least five clear days before date fixed. The date and hours of the election are the same as for parish councillors elected for the same parish. An elector cannot vote in more than one parish in the district, although his property may be in several. GUARDIANS (OUTSIDE LONDON). I. CONSTITUTION. Under rural district councillors, ante, the status and election of the guardians, and the term of office have been explained, so far as they relate to a guardian for rural districts, and the same apply to all guardians, whether in rural or urban districts out- side London, with one or two minor differences in the case of guardians in boroughs, which are noted below. II.-QUALIFICATION. The qualification is the same whether in rural or urban districts, except in the case of a borough, where, additionally, in case of a parish wholly or partly situate in the borough, the residence qualification of a municipal councillor is that to qualify for a guardian. III.--THE POLL. The Polling hours for Guardians in urban districts, other than boroughs, and for urban district councillors, are the same. &quot; &quot;32 BRITISH AND FOREIGN AMBASSADORS, &amp;amp;c.

L-Education-*EDUCATION BILL-continued. inclined to make almost any concession rather than leave the question to another Session. He protested against the decision to stop communications.-Lord Goschen (C.) said that if the Govt. Bill had been passed, it would have put religious teaching out of gear for many years.-Lord Ripon expressed deep regret that the Bill should be destroyed, and said he did not think they would again get one as good. They would have over again all the trouble which had arisen under the Act of 1902, the renewal of agitation, and let them not suppose that the people who felt aggrieved in the past would be quiet.-The motion to insist on the amendments was carried by 132 to 52. Dec. 19. C-On the order for considering the Lords&apos; reasons for returning their amendments en bloc to the Commons, Sir H. C.-Bannerman rose to move that it be discharged. He declared that it was for the Commons alone to decide how they should deal with amendments from the Lords. There was a general desire for negotiation, conciliation and peace, and that many concessions had been made by the Govt. which strained the allegiance of the party. But the Govt. were met with an impossible demand, which would have perpetrated and extended the system which the Bill was designed to control. For a Bill so amended the Govt. had no use, and there was nothing for it but to drop the order. The general election and its result went for nothing, and the Lords had killed the Bill. For the time the Commons were compelled to acquiesce in this state of things, but the resources of the British Constitution were not exhausted. A way must and would be found by which the will of the people would be made to prevail. Mr. W. Long (C.) denied that the country had approved the Bill and challenged Ministers to prove such a claim. There was not one sincere mourner over the Bill. The Lords&apos; amendments merely gave effect to the declared intentions of the Govt. to carry on the educational system in conformity with the wishes of the parents, giving all denominations the same opportunities. Mr. J. Redmond (N.) regretted the loss of the Bill, and appealed for generous treatment of Catholic schools in future.-Mr. Ker Hardie (Soc.) warned the Lords that any attempt to bribe the Labour party to support them would be futile. There was no middle course between secularism and meeting the demands of all the Christian sects.-Mr. Birrell said he was greatly disappointed at the result, which threw away the labour of 30 long weary days. As to the future, he should administer the law fearlessly and maintain education at its proper level, but he looked with grave apprehension to what was ahead.--The motion was passed without opposition. Dec. 20. EIGHT HOURS BILL.-See under LABOUR. C-Election Expenses. Mr. Rowlands (Lab.) moved that all official charges at Parliamentary elections ought to be defrayed out of public funds. He estimated the cost at about £200,000.-Mr. Akers-Douglas (C.) held strongly that the cost should be defrayed out of the Exchequer. Sir L. Walton (L.), (Atty.-Genl.), agreed with the motion, but considered that the burden should be local with, possibly, an Imperial grant in aid. The subject, however, was not urgent.-Carried nem. con. March 6. L-Election Meetings.-Lord Burghclere (L.) moved the 2nd R. of a Bill to enable candidates for local elections to use public elementary schools for public meetings under conditions.—The Abp. of Canterbury supported the Bill, which was read a 2nd time. FACTORY ACTS.-See under LABOUR. April 3. C-Finance. *THE BUDGET.-Mr. Asquith (L.), (Chan. of Exchr.) introduced his first Budget. He showed that the estimates for 1905-6 had been falsified, but favour- ably, by the results, the revenue having amounted to £143,978,000 (an excess of £1,524,000 over estimate), and the expenditure to £149,512,000 (a decrease on estimate of £1,520,000), leaving a realised surplus of £3,466,000. He next explained in detail how this result had been arrived at, viz., by savings in Supply services, the War Office alone having spent £963,000 less than estimate. Including £9,901,000 for Local Taxation, the total expenditure out of taxation was £150,413,000, and loans on capital account amounted to £6,148,000. The revenue had exceeded calculations by the steady growth of prosperity in the country, as shown by the rise of freights, railway receipts, bankers&apos; clearances and the fall in the numbers of unemployed. Decrease had taken place in the yield of the tea duty, though the consumption had increased by 10 millions of lbs. Sugar had yielded an increased revenue of £465,000, the pro- duction exceeding all records. The Excise receipts were inelastic, and there was a steady decrease in the yield from alcohol, which might be welcome to the social reformer, but not equally so to a Chancellor of the Exchequer. The change had affected all classes of society, the decline in wine being greater than in spirits and beer. It might, however, be due not so much to temperance as to decreased spending power. Alcohol could not now be relied upon as a source of expanding revenu &quot; &quot;CONSTITUENCIES AND ELECTIONS. 187 7,933 7,655 J. K. Cross, d.. L. 6,725 J. P. Thomasson, d. .L. 6,228 H. M.

After the Restoration the popular assembly showed some symptoms of a relapse into subservience, but only outwardly so; its supremacy was firmly established by the Revolution of 1683, which for the second time drove the representative of the Stuart dynasty into exile, and finally transferred the principal authority from the king to the represent- atives of the people. &amp;quot;9 6: In the Declaration of Right submitted to William III on coming to the throne, the powers of the House of Commons are clearly defined. William accepted the crown with the acknowledgment that the king had no right to exercise a dispensing power, or to exact money, or maintain a standing army, save by consent of Parliament.&apos; A very important change was effected soon after his accession. The vote of supplies was made an annual one, and the powers necessary for the pay and discipline of the army were granted but for a single year. The grant of supplies and the Army Act have remained annual ever since, and the necessity for passing them ensures the annual meeting of Parliament. William III also belongs the credit of the solution of the difficulty occasioned by the growth of the new power of the Commons, when he began to choose his ministers from among the members of the party strongest in the House of Commons. This change is the origin of our system of government by party, and has been productive of far-reaching results. To At In 1714, upon the accession of the House of Hanover, the power of the House of Commons was well established, and its place in the constitution had become clearly defined. The Septennial Act, limiting the duration of parliaments to seven years, was passed in 1716. the Restoration the number of members was 513, and they were increased to 558 in 1707, when the Act of Union of the English and Scottish Parliaments was passed, and 45 members were allotted to Scotland. In 1800, upon the union with the Ir.sh Parliament, 100 members were added, bringing the total up to 658. By the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885, the number of members was raised from 652 to 670-England and Wales having 495 instead of 489, Scotland 72 instead of 60, Ireland having still 103. The County scats in England and Wales are now 253 instead of 187, in Scotland 39 instead of 32, and in Ireland 85 instead of 64, while the number of Borough seats (including Universities) was in England reduced from 302 to 242, in Scotland raise&apos;l from 28 to 32, and in Ireland red iced from 39 to 18. The total result was that through- out the United Kingdom the number of County seats was raised from 283 to 377, while the number of Borough seats (in- cluding Universities) was reduced from 369 to 293. The franchises upon which the House of Commons was elected began to be the subject of Parliamentary discussion in 1785, when Pitt brought forward his motion for Electoral Reform, by which many of the decayed boroughs would have been disfranchised. In 1809 Sir Francis Burdett again raised the ques- tion; but, although the subject was afterwards kept much before the public, it was not till 1832 that what is known as the first Reform Act was passed. By this Act, 56 constituencies, returning 111 members, were totally disfranchised, and thirty others lost one Member each. new Boroughs were given the right to return two members, and 20 to return one member. 65 new County consti- tuencies were created. In Scotland and Ireland, the County representation re- mained unaltered, but eight new Scotch burghs were add-d. Both the Borough and County franchises were extended, the franchise being bestowed in Boroughs on all £10 resident householders. 22 In 1867 the second Reform Act was passed by Mr. Disraeli. 11 Boroughs in England were totally disfranchised, and 23 others lost one member each. 25 new seats were bestowed on boroughs and Unive sities, and 28 on Counties. The franchise was conferred in Boroughs on all householders, and on lodgers occupy- ing lodgings of not less than £10 annual value. In the following year the Act, with some slight modifications, was ex- tended to Scotland. In Ireland, the County franchise remainel unaltered, but in Boroughs, householders rated at an annual value of £4 or upwards became entitled to vote. The If there was any injustice or shortcoming in the Reform Act of 1867, both parties were equally responsible for it. Liberals were at that time in a majority in the House of Commons. and could have passed any amendments they liked, or ejected the Bill altogether. In fact, however, the Act, as it was finally passed, was very much in advance of the measure proposed by Mr. Gladstone in 1866, and was regarded by many of the Liberal party, notably by the late Mr. Bright, as having gone to the very verge of what might be granted with safety. &quot; &quot;LOCAL GOVERNMENT. 275 URBAN DISTRICT COUNCILS. I.-CONSTITUTION. The number of councillors is that provided by any local or personal Acts, the County Council having power from time to time to add to the number. The parochial electors of the parishes, in the district are the electors of the coun- cillors of the district, and if the District Council is divided into wards the electors of the councillors for each ward are such of the parochial electors as have qualifications within that ward. ཏ,, Each elector gives one vote and no more for each of any number of persons not exceeding the number to be elected. The term of office of a councillor is three years, one-third of the Council as nearly as possible (and if the district is divided into wards one-third of such ward) going out of office on the 15th April in each year. The County Council may, on request of an Urban District Council, direct the members to go out simultaneously at the end of the third year. The chairman, unless a woman, is, ex officio, a Justice of the Peace for the county. II. QUALIFICATION OF URBAN DISTRICT COUNCILLORS. A councillor must be a parochial elector of some parish within the district, or have resided in the district during the whole of the twelve months immediately preceding the election, No person shall be disqualified by sex or marriage. Disqualifications are the same as those for rural district councillors and guardians III.-ELECTION OF URBAN DISTRICT COUNCILLORS. (a) Notice of election is given by the returning officer (the clerk to the council). Nomination paper is provided by the returning officer free of charge. It must be signed by two parochial electors of the district, or ward, if there are wards. Each candidate must be nominated by a separate nomination paper, and no elector shall sign more nomination papers than there are councillors to be elected for the district or ward, nor shall he sign nomination papers for more than one ward. The returning officer deals with the nominations as in the case for district councillors, and publishes the names of those persons validly nominated. A candidate may withdraw from his candidature by a notice in writing to the returning officer. (b) Election.-If the valid nominations do not exceed the number to be elected there shall be no poll. (c) Poll.-If there is to be a poll the returning officer gives notice at least five clear days before date fixed, with full particulars of candidates. METROPOLITAN BOROUGH COUNCILS. The London Government Act, 1899, established in London, in lieu of the Parish Vestries and District Boards, a number of councils which for all intents and purposes converted the various areas into Municipal Boroughs. Each of these boroughs is governed by a Council, consisting of a Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors. The qualification for the office of councillor is the same as for members of Urban Distr.ct Councils, and the electors are the parochial electors as defined by the Local Govern- ment Act of 1894. Any person on any list of voters for the parish is a parochial elector, and, therefore, is entitled to vote and to be a candidate (except women) for the office of Councillor. INFORMATION FOR CANDIDATES. If a cand date, or a number of candidates combined, determine to institute a canvass of the parish, and to hold meetings, distribute bills, &amp;amp;c., with a view to their election, it is desirable that they should know the provisions of the law as regards such matters, and the limitations which it puts upon their action. EXPENSES. The Local Government Act, 1894, does not apparently contemplate that any large expense will be incurred by candidates at Elections under the Act, since no maximum sum has been laid down by it, nor is any return of expenses required to be made by Candidates, as in the case of Parliamentary and Municipal Elections. &quot; &quot;422 POLITICAL NOTES.

Boycotting.-A form of social ostracism which took its name from the persecution of the late Captain Boycott by the Irish Land League in Mayo in 1880, and has been more or less resorted to in Ireland since. It was condemned by Pope Leo XIII., April 20th, 1888, as contrary to justice and charity. Mr. Gladstone described it as &amp;quot;exclusive dealing.&amp;quot; Brehon Laws,-The ancient laws of Ireland. Bright Clauses, The.-The sections of the Irish Land Act of 1870 introduced at the instance of Mr. Bright with the object of facilitating the purchase of their holdings by the tenants. In practice, these sections had little or no success. (See Ashbourne Acts.) Broad Arrow.-The mark used to dis- tinguish Government property. Introduced in 1689. Broadbottom Administration.- The coalition Government under Pelham, 1744. Budget. The general statement of the finance of the country, annually made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, usually as soon after April 1st as possible. It is derived from the French &apos;Bougette,&amp;quot; a small bag. 64 Bulwer-Clayton Treaty between England and the United States, 1850, by which the two Powers agreed not to construct a canal across the Isthmus of Panama without the consent of the other. In 1900 this consent was given to the United States on condition that the canal should be open to the world&apos;s commerce, and should always remain neutral. Bureaucracy.-A state of society in which social status depends upon official position, as in Russia. Burgesses.-A term originally applied to the representatives of boroughs in Parliament; now, by the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, used to distinguish those entitled to the municipal franchise. Cabal. The term applied to the Cabinet of Charles II. in 1670, being formed from the initial letters of their names: Clifford, Arlington, Buck- ingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale. Cabinet. See article on &amp;quot;The Constitution.&amp;quot; Call of the House.-Has fallen into desue- tude, and has not been ordered since 1836, though a motion has been made for it. The object was to secure a full attendance when any important measure was under discussion, and the names of all members were called over. Capitulations.-The instrument by which certain rights are granted to foreign subjects as in Turkey and Egypt. Carpet-Bagger.-A term applied to a parlia- mentary candidate who has had no previous connection with the place he seeks to represent. Caucus (American).—A combination of electors or voters for the purpose of introducing certain persons into places of trust and power. In England it has taken the form of a large committee of electors selected from the whole con- stituency for the purpose of choosing candidates for the representation of the constituency in the House of Commons and for all municipal honours. It is obviously a powerful means of stifling the voice of a dissentient minority of a party, and of securing the adoption of a particular ticket or programme. Cave. The term is usually applied to a com- bination of a small number of members to defeat a measure introduced by the party to which they belong. The appellation took its origin from the Scriptural parallel drawn by Mr. Bright, March 13th, 1866, when he compared the Liberal oppon- ents of Lord Russell&apos;s Reform Bill to the men who gathered themselves to David in the cave of Adullam. (I Sam. xxii.) Chairman (of Ways and Means).-In every Session, on the first occasion of the House going into Committee, the leader of the House moves &amp;quot;that Mr. take the chair,&amp;quot; and thereupon he becomes the Chairman of Ways and Means and of the Committee of the whole House during that Session.

Chauvinism. The term (derived from Chau- vin, a character in one of Scribe&apos;s comedies) is used to describe an exaggerated form of patriotism. Chiltern Hundreds.-The acceptance of this office is a form by which a member of Parlia- ment can resign his seat. It is only by obtaining office that he can do so, and the Crown is therefore always ready to confer on any member, except in cases of misconduct, the Stewardship of the Chil- tern Hundreds, of East Hendred and Northstead, or of Poynings, which he holds till another member is appointed to it. A writ for a vacancy caused by acceptance of the Chiltern Hundreds can only be issued while Parliament is sitting. Church Rate.-The rate imposed by par- ishioners in vestry meeting for the purpose of maintaining the fabric and services of the parish church. It was abolished as a compulsory im- post in 1868.

Estimates are submitted to it, and resolutions moved granting to the Crown the sums requisite. (3) &amp;quot;Of Ways and Means&amp;quot; is formed in the same way for any proceedings relating to the funds by which the expenditure of the country is sustained.

Those agreed to are reported to the House, and incorporated in Bills. (4) &amp;quot;Of Selection&amp;quot; is a Committee nominated by the House of experienced members, whose duties are to nominate the members of Private Bill Committees, and in any other case where the House may so order. The present chair- man is Mr. T. F. Halsey. &amp;quot;Private Bill.&amp;quot;-These Committees are nom- inated by the Committee of Selection, and usually consist of five members, sometimes (5) &quot; &apos;426 POLITICAL NOTES.

Parliament to be responsible to Parliament for anything done by the council in the exercise of its delegated powers. The Minister would not at present have a salary.— The amendment was carried by 279 to 50.-Mr. Lloyd-George then moved that the Bd. of Education should deal with appeals, and should have the regulation and control of State-aided schools.-Mr. Balfour said that things were now in hopeless confusion. At 10.30 p.m. the special closure resolution came into force, and the amendment was carried by 387 to 105, the clause being then carried by a majority of 288. July 17. New clauses were next considered, the first being by Mr. Birrell, to provide that where a local authority and the owners of a schoolhouse failed to come to an agreement as to the use of the premises, either party might appeal to the Bd. of Education, and if suitable it should have the power to make an order for the use of the building. If the clause were not acceptable to the Opposition he should not press it.-Mr. Cave (C.) argued against the bilateral character of the new provision, and Mr. Balfour repudiated the responsibility cast on the Opposition. The new clause, he said, did not satisfy the expectations which were held out; it gave local authorities power to commandeer every denominational school in their district, and put schools for which extended facilities for religious instruction were demanded at the mercy of the authorities.— Mr. T. P. O&apos;Connor (N.) said his party were not disposed to favour the clause.—The clause was negatived by 327 to 78, the Govt. voting against it.-Mr. Birrell moved a long clause, imposing on county councils the duty of preparing, within two years, schemes for delegating some of their powers to representative bodies, on which women might serve. Mr. Balfour said the clause lacked elasticity, and London was excluded. -The clause was read a second time.-At 10.30 p.m. the closure was imposed, and the clause was carried by 365 to 95, and finally the Bill passed through Committee. Ayes, 303; noes, 141. July 18. The Bill was considered on Report.-Lord R. Cecil moved its recommittal in respect of Cl. 4 and the clause establishing an education council for Wales.—Mr. Birrell opposed, and asserted that the Govt. had conceded every demand of the Opposition except their demand for dropping this scheme. Mr. Balfour said many important aspects of Cl. 4 had not been discussed, and the course taken on the Welsh clause was a travesty of Parliamentary proceedings. The motion was rejected by 279 to 146. -Lord R. Cecil moved a new clause, that &amp;quot;religious instruction &amp;quot; might include instruction in the tenets and formularies of any religious denomination. Mr. Balfour said this plan had worked well in Scotland, and provided for real popular control. He preferred, however, the alternative of parental control, management, and responsi- bility. The clause was rejected by a majority of 140.-A clause by Mr. S. Roberts (C.), giving an appeal to the Bd. of Education when a local authority proposed to dis- continue a voluntary school, was negatived by 261 to 138. July 23 On Cl. 2, Mr. H. Cox (L.) moved an amendment to restore voluntary schools to the position which they occupied before 1902, by allowing State-aid without rate-aid.— Mr. Birrell refused to assent to facilities for &amp;quot;contracting out.&amp;quot;-Mr. Balfour supported the amendment, as also did Sir T. Esmonde, on behalf of Roman Catholics. It was negatived, however, by 318 to 155.-On Cl. 3 an amendment by Lord R. Cecil to compel local authorities to take over the voluntary schools was negatived by 359 to 93.-Mr. Lough moved an amendment to allow elasticity in fixing the two mornings for religious instruction.-Carried by a majority of 264.-An amendment by Mr. Rawlinson to give an appeal to the Ld. of Education in cases of dispute in regard to the facilities was rejected by a majority of 174. July 24. The Report stage was completed, a few only of the remaining amendments being debated before the closure came into force.-Sir W. Anson moved to make it obligatory on local education authorities to grant the religious facilities which parents might desire. Dr. Macnamara (L.) and others supported the amendment.-Mr. Balfour insisted that it ought to be made clear that special facilities must be granted whenever a case for them was made out, and that no local authority should be able to render abortive all that had taken place. Mr. Birrell declined to alter the discretionary character of the clause. Obstinate local authorities might be dealt with by the Bd. of Education on appeal by mandamus.-Mr. Perks said the clause was most unpopular among Nonconformists, which Mr. Birrell denied. The amendment was rejected by 247 to 160.-Mr. E. Cecil moved to extend the clause to other than urban areas.- Mr. Talbot (C.) argued that it was a monstrous outrage to ignore the religious convictions of Anglicans, when those of other denominationalists were respected.-Mr. Birrell claimed that the Bill would benefit Jews and Roman Catholics, and also a very large percentage of Church of England children. He denied that its object was to injure the Church, Amendment negatived by 245 to 118, Further amendments were &quot; &quot;VOTES IN DIVISIONS-SESSIONS 1906. 349 MEMBERS. 2 co 3 4 5 6 1- 7 8 9 Party.

The Govt. would endeavour to enforce the principle of equal rights. The resolution was agreed to. Feb. 28. L-An animated discussion took place, chiefly on the question of Chinese labour in the Transvaal.-Lord Elgin stated that the Govt. wished to place all possible in- formation before the House, but full details were not then available as to the removal of Chinese from one mine to another, the repatriation of the coolies, and the cost. March 5. C-Sir H. C.-Bannerman declined to recommend a Royal Commission on the system of indentured labour in the Transvaal, and the allegations made by Ministers that the system constituted a state of slavery or semi-slavery.-On Report of the Vote on Account, Maj. Seely complained that British Consuls in China were acting as re- cruiting agents for the enlistment of coolies. He moved to reduce the vote.-Mr. Churchill said that H.M. Govt. proposed to instruct the Consuls not to exercise such functions, and this would prevent the exportation of coolies to S. Africa until the Transvaal Govt. should decide the question. If they should make new proposals, H.M. Govt. would use the veto of the Crown against any interference with the funda- mental principles of liberty. The mine-owners would do well to face the situation, and strive to find a substitute for Chinese labour. The new policy would not injure any intrinsically valuable property on the Rand or stop the flow of gold. Kaffir labour might be obtained locally if the conditions were made more attractive.—Mr. Balfour said this might be construed as a threat to the mine-owners, and the Transvaal was dependent for its prosperity on the gold industry. He expressed profound anxiety as to the future of our relations with the Transvaal. Self-government could not be carried on on the principles now explained. The colonists would be the slaves of the Foreign Office and of the Colonial Office. Nothing had produced_more__ bitter antagonism than interference from Downing Street. Sir E. Gry (L.), Foreign Secy., argued that to refuse to aid the Transvaal to obtain Chinese labour except under proper conditions was not to thwart the Colony. He did not believe that with a responsible Govt., freely elected, there would be any serious conflict between the Transvaal and the mother country on a moral question. The policy of the Govt. in regard to coolie labour was approved by the self- governing Colonies.—Mr. J. Chamberlain (L.U.) denied that coolic labour as carried on in the Transvaal was morally repugnant. The Govt. had decided prematurely, without inquiry. A Royal Commission alone ought to pronounce authoritatively as to the nature and working of the Ordinances. The Govt. pronounced the system to be repugnant to their moral sense, and yet it was to be allowed to continue. The Chinese could be sent back at once, if desired, subject to the payment of compensation; but money ought not to stand in the way if there were a moral obligation. He warned the Govt. solemnly that they could not impose their ideas of morality on self-governing Colonies and at the same time keep the Empire together. Mr. Ridsdale (L.) separated himself from his party on this issue, considering the action of Ministers as leading to great danger.-Mr. Walsh (Lab.) insisted that the Govt. ought to suspend the licences issued in 1905. Mar. 14. On the 2nd R. of a Consolidated Fund Bill, Mr. J. Chamberlain (L.U.) moved an amendment demanding an assurance by the Govt. that a Royal Commission would be issued to inquire into the economic and moral effects of indentured labour in the Transvaal. He said the prosperity of the whole of S. Africa was at stake and that a wrong decision might bring about disaster. Mining must long remain the principal industry of the Transvaal, and if the mines were closed, thousands of British workmen would be thrown out of work and British influence would disappear. England would also lose one of its best customers, and workmen here would suffer. A large reduction in the export of gold would seriously affect our finance. The industry could not develop while a sword was hanging over it. White unskilled labour could not be employed instead of Chinese and native labour, and the latter was not procurable in sufficient quantities as the Kaffirs would not work. Their wives were in a state of semi-slavery, and the more wages the men were paid the more semi-slaves there would be. The experiment of dispensing with Chinese labour was being made upon insufficient knowledge, and an expert Commission should be sent out to ascertain the real facts, and also to satisfy the country on the moral side of the question. One Minister described the system as slavery, another as semi-slavery, and another as tainted with slavery, while Lord Elgin repudiated all responsibility for such statements. There was great indignation in S. Africa owing to the menace to the colonists. Inquiry would show if evil practices were going on and their continuance could be made impossible before self-government was granted. -Mr. Churchill said the appointment of a Commission would serve no good purpose, &quot; &quot;9 Last Quarter New Moon JUNE, 1907.

He said &amp;quot;For a century, ever since the es- tablishment of the Government of the United States, all great authorities- American, German, French, Italian-have agreed in this, that a Representative Government is impossible without a second Chamber. However anxious foreign countries have been to enjoy this advantage, that anxiety has only been equalled by the difficulty which they have found in fulfilling their object. How is a second Chamber to be constituted? By nominees of the Sovereign power? What influence can be exercised by a Chamber of nominees? It is a proverb of general disrespect. Are they to be supplied by popular election? In what manner are they to be elected? If by the same con- stituency as the popular body, what claim have they, under such circumstances, to criticise or to control the decisions of that body? If they are to be elected by a more select body, qualified by a higher franchise, there immediately occurs the objection, why should the elected majority be governed by the elected minority? The United States of America were fortunate in finding a solution of this difficulty; but the United States of America had elements to deal with which never occurred before, and never probably will occur again, because they formed their illustrious Senate from the materials that were offered them by the 37 Sovereign States. We, gentlemen, have the House of Lords, an assembly which has histori- cally developed itself in an ancient nation, and periodically adapted itself to the wants and necessities of the times.&amp;quot; PROCEDURE. The usual hour of meeting of the House of Lords is at a quarter past four o&apos;clock. It may proceed to business if at least three peers are present; but no question can be decided on a division unless thirty peers at least take part in the vote. The stages through which a Bill has to pass in the House of Lords correspond with those in the House of Commons. But in the Upper House the first reading of a Bill is usually a matter of course; discussion is reserved for the second reading, when the principle of the Bill is decided upon. If the second reading be carried, it is not usual to raise the question again on going into committee, or by any amendment going to the root of the matter. But a Bill which has passed the House of Commons is often read a second time with the understanding that large alterations are to be made in Committee, limiting the scope of the Bill, though not defeating its a object. A Bill after passing the second reading, or after passing through Com- mittee of the whole House, may be referred to a Standing Committee, as in the House of Commons. These Committees are composed of not more than 40 nor less than 20 peers, and all are nominated by the Committee of Selection. The quorum is twelve, and the procedure is the same as in a Select Committee. When decisive majority has declared in favour of a Bill, the third reading is not often opposed, unless in consequence of some- thing that has occurred in Committee or on the report of amendments. But if the majority has been so small as to leave the real opinion of the House uncertain, there is nothing irregular in a fresh trial of strength on the third reading, which some- times results in the loss of the Bill. The Lords&apos; amendments on a House of Commons Bill, and vice versa, may be accepted, rejected, or modified by the other House. If the two Houses cannot agree, a Conference may be held between members on both sides. For many years, however, such Conferences have been wholly formal, no discussion taking place. Written reasons are delivered for the course adopted. The difference, there- fore, must be settled by concession on one or both sides. If both parties persist in disagreement, the measure is dropped. The Lord Chancellor (who is usually, but not of necessity, a peer) presides in debates as Speaker, but without the authority of the Speaker of the House of Commons as guardian of order. His position as a member of the Ministry of the day would be incompatible with that of an arbiter between parties, and as he is frequently a new member of the House, he would not necessarily have the ex- perience of a Speaker of the House of Commons. Order is maintained by the House at large, which decides by acclama- tion, or, in extreme cases, by vote, as to Since which of two speakers be heard. 1889, peers have been at liberty to refer to each other in debate by name. The Chairman of Committees, who is elected for each Parliament, exercises full authority on points of order in Committee. The Lord Chancellor has not a casting vote when the House is equally divided.&apos; His vote is taken first on every division, but if the numbers be equal, he declares that the &amp;quot;Not Contents&amp;quot; have it, the rule being Semper praesumitur pro negante.&apos; 6: Though Bills granting money to the Crown, or imposing pecuniary liabilities, pass through the same stages as others. the privileges of the House of Commons, have been, since 1768, held to preclude their origination or amendment by the &quot; &quot;231 MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES, 1885-1907. *Benn, Sir J.

(1) A local education authority may afford extended facilities for religious instruction of some special character not permitted under section fourteen of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, in any transferred voluntary school in an urban area, by permitting the religious in- struction given in the school to be instruction of that special character, notwithstanding anything in that section, if an application is made to them for those extended facilities, and if they are satisfied, after holding a public local inquiry with reference to the application, (a) that, as the result of a ballot taken previously to the inquiry as to the wishes of the parents in accordance with this section, it appears that the parents of at least four-fifths of the children attending the school desire those facilities; and (b) that there is public school accom- modation in schools not affected by a permission given under this section for the other children attending the school. Provided that a child shall not be reckoned in the number of children for whom accommodation is required if the parent of the child shows at the inquiry that he does not require that accommoda- tion for his child, and that no vote has been given at the ballot in respect of the child. AS IT LEFT THE LORDS. (4) If any question arises under this section between the owners of the school- house and the local education authority, including any question as to the mode in which the facilities other than facilities afforded on the request of parents should be afforded, that question shall be determined by the Board of Education. (5) In all schools transferred under this section those parents of children attending the school who have expressed their wish for facilities for the giving of religious instruction of some special character, shall elect, in accordance with regulations to be made for the purpose by the Board of Education, four persons, some of whom may be women, who together with one other person nominated by the owners, and one other person nominated by the local authority, shall be known as the parents committee. The parents committee shall be responsi- ble for, and have the control of the religious instruction afforded under such facilities. Extended facilities for special Religious Instruction. 4. (1) A local education authority shall afford extended facilities for religious instruction of some special character not permitted under section fourteen of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, and in accordance with the trust deed, if any, of the school in every transferred volun- tary school, by permitting the religious instruction given in the school to be instruction of that special character, notwithstanding anything in that section, if an application is made to them for those extended facilities, and if they are satisfied, after holding a public looal inquiry with reference to the application, or in case of dispute with the applicants, if the Board of Education are satisfied,- (a) that, as the result of a ballot taken previously to the inquiry as to the wishes of the parents in accordance with this section, it appears that the parents of at least two thirds of the children attending the school whose parents take part in the ballot, desire those facilities; and either (b) that there is public school accom- modation in schools not affected by a permission given under this section for any child whose parent declares his objection to the facilities; or (c) that suitable provision will be made in the school or elsewhere for giving to the children of those &quot; &quot;ELECTORAL STATISTICS-continued. 227 THE GENERAL ELECTION OF 1906-continued. PARTY GAINS AND LOSSES. At the Dissolution of Parliament in January, 1906, the Unionist Party had a majority (as shown on page 154) of 72 over all opponents. At the General Election which followed they lost 229 seats. On the other hand, they gained 14 seats, so that the net Unionist loss was 215 seats, counting 430 on a division, and transforming the former Unionist majority of 72 into a combined Liberal, Labour and Nationalist majority of 358. At this General Election the gains and losses on both sides, were as follows: LIBERAL AND LABOUR GAINS. Aberdeenshire, E. 1 Essex, N.E. 1 1 1 Antrim, N.

Death Duties. The Estate, Legacy and Succession Duties. Democrats.-The advocates for the govern- ment of the people by the people; a name adopted by the French Republicans, 1790, and by the pro- slavery party in the United States. Direct Taxation.-A tax is said to be direct when it is assessed upon the persons on whom the burden of it falls. Thus the income-tax is direct, but a tax on tobacco, which, though paid in the first instance by the dealer, really falls on the consumer, is indirect. Dispensing Power. The power claimed by several English Sovereigns to set aside the laws. It was finally rejected by the Bill of Rights, 1689. Domesday Book.-The book containing the General Survey of England, completed in 1086. The Modern Domesday Book or Return of Owners of Land, was issued in 1875 (Parl. Paper, 1097). Drawback or Rebate.-Duty remitted or paid back by the Government on the exportation or re-exportation of the commodities on which the duty was charged. Education Code.-The annual regulations issued by the Board of Education, in accordance with which the grants to elementary schools are determined. Eight Hours Movement.-A proposal to enact a legal working day of eight hours; first adopted in England by the Trades Union Con- gress at Liverpool, September, 1890. Elgin Commission.-The Royal Commis- sion of Enquiry into the S. African War, held in 1903, under the Chairmanship of Lord Elgin. Estimates.-The annual statements prepar- ed by the heads of the Government Departments, of the sums to be voted by the House of Commons for the requirements of the year. Exchange.-The par of exchange is the fixed value of the standard of value of one country in the standard of value of another country-e.g., £1=4dols. 86c. 64m., American. The exchange is said to be against a country, say England, when a bill on London can be purchased in New York below its par value. interest- Exchequer.-The national Treasury. Exchequer Bills.-Negotiable bearing bills payable to bearer, issued by the Treasury under the authority of Parliament for amounts varying from £100 to £1,000. Extradition.-The surrender of fugitives from justice by one State to another in pursuance of a treaty. Faggot Vote.-A vote procured by an illusory purchase of property with the object of acquiring a nominal qualification. Faggot votes were usually manufactured by the division of a hereditament into qualifying lots, which were dis- tributed between several persons; they occurred chiefly in counties, and were virtually abolished by the Franchise Act of 1884. Fair Trade.-The principle urged by the supporters of the doctrine is that although Free Trade ought to be universally adopted by nations, yet one nation ought not to subject its industries to a disadvantage by refusing in the face of hostile tariffs to tax foreign goods. In other words, if France, for example, refuses to admit our goods free of duty, we in fairness ought to levy a reciprocal duty on French goods. Federation.-Where several States combine on equal terms to provide and obey a common central government for matters of general polity, e.g., foreign relations, while each State governs itself in local matters, the combination is called a federation-the Commonwealth of Australia, for example. Fenians. The common name of the &amp;quot;Irish Republican Brotherhood,&amp;quot; instituted in 1858 by James Stephens, whose attempted insurrection in 1867 was easily suppressed. Filibusters.-A name given to Freebooters who plundered the American coasts in the 17th century, and now applied to any illegitimate mili- tary enterprise. Forbes Mackenzie Act.-The Act of 1853 which regulates public houses in Scotland.

Free Port.-A port where ships of all nations may load and unload free of duty, provided the goods are not carried into the adjoining country. Free Trade.-Trade free from restrictions, and in particular unencumbered by customs duties designed to prohibit or restrict the importa- tion of foreign goods. French Treaty.- The treaty negotiated by Cobden with France in 1860. Funded Debt. - That part of a national debt which stands in the form of permanent stock, as opposed to money owing on bills, paper currency or other temporary indebtedness, which is classed as Unfunded Debt. Game Laws.-The principal Act is that of 1 and 2 William IV., c. 32, which greatly modified preceding laws and legalised the sale of game at certain seasons. Geneva Convention.-The international code adopted in 1864, which lays down the regula- tions under which succour is provided for the sick and wounded in war.

Holy Alliance.-The alliance entered into in 1815, between the sovereigns of Russia, Prussia, and Austria, by which they bound themselves to be governed by Christian principles in their policy, with the object of maintaining the peace of their States. &quot; &quot;PARLIAMENTARY SUMMARY, 1906. 299 C-Education-*EDUCATION BILL-continued. -Mr. Paul (L.) said the opposition to the Bill came from the small knot of High Churchmen and Romanising ecclesiastical laymen.-Lord R. Cecil (C.) contradicted this statement, and declared that Churchmen regarded religion as the foundation on which all education should rest.—Mr. Snowden (Soc.) advocated a system of secular education. Mr. A. Balfour (C.) argued that to establish a Welsh Education Council would confer administrative educational autonomy on Wales, while leaving the Welsh members free to criticise English and Scotch matters. Under Cl. 4 the Church of England would receive worse treatment than Roman Catholics or Jews. The late Govt. had dealt with the religious question in a much more liberal spirit. This Bill did not establish complete popular control over religious education, and did not provide that no inquiry should be made as to the capacity of teachers to teach religion. It would entail an expenditure of one million a year for no good purpose and must impair religious teaching. The Church had more than half the population of the country and would not submit to manifest injustice. The Bill should be withdrawn and recast on new principles.-Mr. Birrell insisted that the Bill, though possibly faulty, would promote the cause of peace and of education. He anticipated that denomina- tional teaching would be given in Church schools on two days a week, and that was sufficient, as you could not always be teaching the catechism. If Church schools could not be obtained on reasonable terms the country was rich enough to erect its own buildings. The county council syllabuses for religious instruction were instinct with the Christian religion and the spirit of Protestantism. The alternatives were pan-denominationalism, which the people did not want, and the secular system, which was not practicable. The Govt. had done their best to meet the Protestants and Roman Catholics. The &amp;quot;four-fifths &amp;quot; clause was a reality and not illusory, drawn in a permissive form, and was confined to urban areas because the Bill was intended to be a charter of freedom for the village Nonconformist. The House ought to do nothing which might cause a gap in the education of the children, who had now acquired the habit of school going and ought to continue to enjoy the blessings of education. The rejection of the Bill was negatived by 410 to 204. May 10. On going into Committee, Mr. Stuart Wortley (C.) proposed to direct the Committee to deal separately with Part IV. (Educational Council for Wales).—Mr. J. Redmond supported the clause as partly recognising the principle of Home Rule.-Mr. Balfour opposed Part IV. as not relevant to the question. The instruction was negatived by 388 to 102.-Mr. S. Roberts (C.) moved to direct the division of the Bill into two parts, separating elementary education from the question of endowments.-Mr. Dillon (N.) said that his party would not offer irreconcilable opposition at this stage, as they did not know what amendments the Govt. would accept.-Mr. Rawlinson (C.) said the endowment clauses would oust the jurisdiction of the High Court in regard to the law affecting trustees.-Mr. A. Balfour said they would create a revolution in the law of trusts, The instruction was rejected by 353 to 107.-In Committee on Cl. 1, Mr. L. Hardy (C.) moved to postpone it. It made every elementary school a provided school, thus destroying the denominational character of 14,000 schools.-Sir W. Robson (L.), Solr.-Genl., said the clause was fundamental and should be discussed first. Mr. Wyndham protested that it created a presumption that undenominational instruction was right for all schools, and that it violated the consciences of thousands. -Mr. Dillon supported the postponement.-Mr. Birrell described the clause as the spinal cord of the Bill, and argued that it should be placed first.-Amendment rejected by 335 to 160.-Mr. Healy (N.) moved that there should be special ad hoc elections before local authorities undertook their duties.-Mr. Birrell said this would bring the Bill into operation piecemeal, but the date for its operation might be discussed later.— Negatived by a majority of 150.-Sir W. Anson (L.U.) moved that the date for converting non-provided into provided schools should be extended from 1908 to 1910, as there was not time to allow managers to make arrangements with the local authorities. Mr. Birrell&apos;s challenge to the ratepayers to provide new schools all over the country would not be accepted by the people. The clause contained a broad hint to the Commission to make short work of the voluntary schools. Mr. Birrell said that if the Commission should be blocked with schemes the time might be extended. The amendment was rejected by 349 to 171. May 21. Mr. Ashley (C.) proposed that the local authorities should have power to fix a date for the operation of Cl. 1.-Mr. Chamberlain maintained that the time allowed was quite inadequate for making 14,000 agreements.-Mr. Birrell replied that 15 months were sufficient for negotiations between the local authorities and the managers.- Mr. Dillon opposed the amendment, which was negatived by 406 to 114.-Mr. Salter (C.) moved that the operation of the clause might be deferred by Order in Council.- Negatived by 361 to 190.-Sir H. Craik (C.) moved to enable non-provided schools &quot; &quot;228 ELECTORAL STATISTICS-continued. POPULATION AND REPRESENTATION. The population of the Parliamentary Counties and Boroughs of the United Kingdom in 1901 was 41,458,721, and the total number of Members of the House of Commons, excluding the Universities, is 661. Dividing the population by the number of members, each member should represent a population of 62,721. As it is, however- England, with a population of 30,808,539, has only 460 members or one member for every 66,975 persons. Wales, with a population of 1,719,304, has thirty members, or one member for every 57,310 persons. Scotland, with a population of 4,472,103, has seventy members, or one member for every 63,885 persons. Ireland, with a population of 4,458,775, has 101 members, or one member for every 44,147 persons. At the proportion of one member to represent 62,721 people— England should have 491 members, instead of 460, as at present. Wales should have 28 members, not 30 as at present. Scotland should have 71 members, not 70 as at present. Ireland should have 71 members, not 101 as at present. COST OF GENERAL ELECTIONS.

SUPREME COURT PAY OFFICE. See under Paymaster-General. TRADE, THE BOARD OF (White- hall Gardens, S. W.).-The Board is merely a nominal body, entitled, &amp;quot;The Committee of Council appointed for the consi&apos;era- tion of all matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations.&amp;quot; It is administered by a President, who changes with the Government, and is assisted by a Parlia- mentary and a Permanent Secretary. All matters relating to trade and com- merce fall to its charge, except certain functions exercised by the Home Office and the Commercial Department of the Foreign Office. Under the Conciliation Act of 1896 the Board has powers of intervention, inquiry, and arbitration in trade disputes, which have been frequently exercised with great benefit. The powers of the former Commissioners of Emigration are now vested in the Board of Trade. (See also under Colonial Office.) The various departments of the Board of Trade are:- MARINE (54, Victoria Street, S.W.). - Under the Merchant Shipping Acts the powers of the Board include the survey and detention of unseaworthy or over-laden ships, the provision of local Mercantile Marine offices for the engage- ment and discharge of seamen, the inspec- tion of boilers, the conduct of inquiries into shipping disasters, and the supervision of expenditure out of the Lighthouse Fund. The General Register and Record Office of Shipping and Seamen (Carlisle Place, Westminster, S. W.) is also a branch of the Board of Trade. RAILWAYS.-With regard to Railways. many duties are imposed upon the Board by the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1888, and subsequent statutes, such as the Hours of Railway Workmen Act, 1894, the Light Railways Act of 1896, and the Prevention of Accidents Act, 1900. Its powers of inspection are also in all respects very wide. No line can be opened without a certificate from the Board, cases of accident are investigated, and all by-laws are submitted for the Board&apos;s approval. HARBOURS. The control and super- vision of Harbours, and the protection of the rights of the Crown in foreshores, are under the Board of Trade. The Electric ELECTRIC LIGHTING. Lighting Acts give great powers to the Board as to granting licences and pro- visional orders for the supply of electricity, and as to inserting conditions for the public safety. BANKRUPTCY (1, Horse Guards&apos; Avenue, S.W.) and COMPANIES (8, De- lahay Street, S. W.). -The Bankruptcy and Companies&apos; Winding-up Acts also give large powers to the Board, involv- ing practically the supervision of every bankrupt estate or company in England and Wales, and the appointment of all the official receivers. The COMMERCIAL, LABOUR &amp;amp; STATISTICAL (Commercial Department, 7, Whitehall Gardens, S. W.; Commercial Intelligence- Branch, 73. Basinghall Street, E. C.; Labour Department. 44 and 50, Parliament Street, S. W.; Statistical Department, 1, Whitehall, S.W.)-A &amp;quot;Labour Bureau&amp;quot; was organized by the late Mr. Mundella in 1885, the object being the collection and dissemination of statistical and other in- formation as to the rate of wages, the cost of manufacture, and the selling prices of produce at home and abroad. This work was further developed in 1893, when a separate department was organised, entitled the Labour Department,&amp;quot; having distinct offices and a special staff. Labour Department has a staff of corres- pondents in the larger towns, whose duty it is to inform the central office of im- portant events affecting labour in their districts, and to conduct local investiga- tions. The Labour Gazette (monthly, 1d.) is issued by this Department for supplying information on subjects of special interest to workmen and work- women, such as trade disputes, important industrial negotiations, sliding scales, &amp;amp;c. The Department also publishes digests of reports of the inspectors of mines and, fac- tories, of proceedings under the Employers&apos; Liability and Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts, of action taken by local authorities with regard to the sanitary condition of workshops, the housing of the poor, the provision of allotments, &amp;amp;c. Important meetings and conferences are noticed, and statistics are given of pauperism, immi- gration, savings banks, education (especially in its industrial aspects), exports and imports, and the prices of the chief articles of consumption by workmen, as well as comparative tables of wholesale prices of leading articles in the chief markets of the world. A large number of copies is gratuitously dis- tributed to Free Libraries, workmen&apos;s organisations, Mechanics&apos; Institutes, Chambers of Commerce, and other institutions. An annual report is issued The Board of Trade Journal (weekly, 1d.). is issued by the Commercial Department, and sets forth tariff changes, movements in foreign markets, foreign commercial legis- lation, port and harbour regulations, &amp;amp;c.

Every candidate must be nominated in writing by two registered County electors of the electoral division for which he stands, and eight others must assent to the nomina- tion. The names of the nominators and assentors should be signed in full. No elector must subscribe more nomination papers than there are vacancies to be filled. Nomination papers must be delivered by the candidate, or his proposer or seconder, at a place and time to be fixed by the Returning Officer. In a borough, nominations must be delivered to the Town Clerk. A candidate may withdraw by giving written notice not later than 2 pm. on the day after the last day for nomination. CONDUCT AND MANAGEMENT OF THE ELÉCTION. MAXIMUM EXPENSE.-The sum which a candidate may expend in the conduct and management of an election is regulated under the Municipal Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Act, 1884, by a scale which allows a maximum of £25 for the first 500 electors, and threepence for each elector above that number. The limit of expenditure, therefore, will be as follows:- For 500 electors 1,000 99 1,500 99 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 4,500 ... £25 0 0 £31 5 0 £37 10 0 £43 15 0 £50 0 0 £56 5 0 £62 10 0 £68 15 0 £75 0 0 And so on, at the rate of threevence for each elector. These sums must not be exceeded, or the ELECTION WILL BE VOID. (In London, if two candidates stand jointly, the maximum amount for each must be reduced by one fourth, and they are only in that case allowed to hire the number of committee rooms, and employ the number of persons authorised for a single candidate.). COMMITTEE ROOMS.-One committee room is allowed to be hired for each electoral division, or if the number of electors exceeds 2,000 one additional committee room for every additional 2,000, or part of that number. The use of committee rooms voluntarily lent is not limited, provided they are not in prohibited premises. The following premises, or any part of the same, MAY NOT BE USED either as a com- mittee room or for holding a meeting to promote the election of a candidate, viz. :— Premises licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption on or off the premises: Premises where refreshment of any kind, whether food or drink, is ordinarily sold for consumption on the premises : Premises where any intoxicating liquor is supplied to the members of a CLUB, SOCIETY, or ASSOCIATION. N.B.-The use of Public Elementary Schools is not prohibited. EMPLOYMENT.-The number of persons who may be employed for payment, as clerks or messengers, or in either capacity, in connection with the election is as follows:- :- Not more than 2,000 electors... 99 99 99 99 3,000 4,000 99 ... ... 5,000 &amp;quot;2 ... ... ... 2 persons. 3 &amp;quot;&amp;quot; and so on, one additional person being allowed for every 1,000 electors, or part of that number. There is no provision authorising the payment of an election agent, as such. One polling agent is allowed for each polling station, and agents (unpaid) to attend the counting of votes on the candidate&apos;s beha f may also be appointed. Electors who are employed for payment may not vote. ELECTION EXPENSES -Claims in respect of the election expenses of a candidate must be sent in within fourteen days after the election, or they will be barred and cannot be paid. All such expenses must be paid within twenty-one days of the election. Every agent must send into the candidate, within twenty-three days after the election, a return, in writing, of all expenses incurred by him in the conduct and management of the election (under a penalty of £50). &quot; &quot;194 CONSTITUENCIES AND ELECTIONS.

C-Shipping-*MERCHANT SHIPPING BILL-continued. that no foreign seaman should be engaged on a British vessel unless he could under- stand the words of command in English. A better scale of food would be imposed, and a minimum standard fixed. New regulations in regard to emigrants, cattle, and other matters were also to be introduced. Advisory committees for consultation would be set up. The Bill would, if accepted, be referred to the Standing Committee on Trade. -Mr. Wyndham (C.) said the Bill recognised that some forms of competition were unfair and that protection against them was desirable. Foreign seamen competed seriously with British mariners, and British pilots ought not to be robbed of the fruits of their labour by foreigners, who learned too much about our coasts.—Mr. Ll.-George said the question of alien pilotage was not serious, but pilotage certificates ought, if possible, only to be issued to British subjects. Read a first time. March 20. On the 2nd R. of the Bill many points of detail were raised, but the general principle was agreed to.-Mr. Ll.-George replied on the whole debate.-Mr. Chamberlain said he feared the Bill would not secure a much larger proportion of British seamen in British ships. Foreign seamen ought not to be allowed in excess of a fixed proportion of the crew.-The Bill was read a second time and referred to the Standing Committee on Trade. March 27. 66 In the Standing Committee on Cl. 1 (British load-line provisions to apply to all foreign ships in British ports), Mr. A. Taylor (L.) moved to extend it to foreign ships on all voyages with cargo to the United Kingdom.&quot;-Mr. Kearley (L.), Secy. to the Bd. of Trade, objected, as the Govt. were dealing with the question by international negotiations.-The amendment, however, was carried by 22 to 14.-On Cl. 11 (pro- hibiting the engagement of seamen in the United Kingdom with insufficient knowledge of English), Mr. J. H. Wilson (Lab.) moved to apply it in 1908.-Agreed to.-Mr. H. Wilson moved to extend the prohibition to any port between the Elbe and Brest, as the majority of foreign seamen were engaged at such ports.-Mr. Ll.-George, with some doubt, assented to the amendment.-Mr. H. Wilson moved to include Lascars in the prohibition. Mr. Ll-George opposed, in the interests of our Oriental trade, already severely pressed by German competition. May 21. The amendment was defeated by 23 to 13.-Other clauses having been passed, those dealing with the statutory scale of food for seamen were discussed, especially that giving power by Order in Council to vary or add to the scale set out in the schedule.- Mr. C. Wilson (L.) said the new scale would increase the cost from 15 to 20 per cent.- Mr. Ll-George agreed that an Advisory Committee should be set up. May 23. A number of new Govt. clauses were added to the Bill. They dealt with the payment of wages, the relief and maintenance of distressed seamen, and other matters.—— Mr. Ll-George moved a new clause, abolishing the grant of pilotage certificates to foreigners after 1st June, 1906. The Director of Naval Intelligence, he said, reported that the grant of certificates to aliens introduced a possible source of danger to our- selves in war. The clause was agreed to.-A clause giving the Board of Trade power to call for a return as to the earnings of ships met with strong opposition from the shipping members, and was ultimately negatived. June 13. On Report, Mr. Ll.-George moved to delete an amendment made by the Standing Committee respecting the load-line applying to foreign ships on arrival here. He said it would lead to complications and to retaliation.--Mr. B. Law (C.) objected, as foreign shipowners would be given an unfair advantage.-Carried by 313 to 90. Oct. 23. The Report stage was resumed, and the Govt. announced a concession relating to the deduction of spaces. Mr. J. H. Wilson (Lab.) proposed an amendment that lascars serving on board British ships should, when out of the tropics, he provided with the same amount of space as Europeans.-Mr. Rees (L.) opposed, and Mr. LI.-George said that the amendment would cause Lascars to disappear from all vessels leaving British waters for the East, and would kill the British shipping industry for the benefit of Germany.-Amendment was negatived by 248 to 105. Nov. 15. The Report stage was concluded after new clauses had been considered. The Bill was ordered for 3rd R. Nov. 16. After considerable debate the 3rd R. was passed, Mr. Ll.-George thanking the Opposition and shipowners for their support, without which it would hardly have been possible to pass the measure. Nov 22. -The 2nd R. was passed without opposition, after a discussion on various details. —Lord Salisbury (C.) pointed out that the Bill was a legacy from the late Govt., and hoped that something might be done to make the load-line of other countries approxi- mate to that of this country. Nov. 27. The Bill having passed the 2nd R. unchallenged, was considered in Committee, Dec. 11, and subsequently passed.

L-MACEDONIA.-Lord Monkswell (L.) called attention to affairs in Macedonia.- Lord Fitzmaurice (L.), Under Secy., said there had been some slight improvement in the condition of the country, but he did not pretend that progress could not be more rapid. April 6. C-In a debate on the Easter adjournment, Sir E. Grey (L.), Foreign Secy., made a statement as to Macedonia, where, he said, mischief was being done by Greek bands crossing the frontier. He paid a tribute to Lord Lansdowne&apos;s work, and said the Govt. would proceed on the same lines. April 11. Mr. Lynch (L.) called attention to the condition of Macedonia and moved that further reforms were urgent.-Sir E. Grey (L.) agreed that reforms had not gone far enough, but said that England could not act separately or sketch out a large programme unless supported by other Powers. Finance was at the bottom of other reforms, and a small beginning had been made in the right direction. The Govt. concurred in the objects aimed at by Lord Lansdowne&apos;s policy, which they would carry on.—Motion agreed to. May 23. L-Lord Fitzmaurice stated that the incursion of Greek bands into Macedonia was one of the greatest difficulties with which the Powers had to deal. It was hoped that the Greek Govt. would spare no effort to put an end to the dangerous condition of affairs. July 19. C-In Supply, on the Foreign Office vote, Sir E. Grey stated that the present difficulties in Macedonia were due to the activity of bands of rival nationalities, which prevented the reduction of the Turkish military force maintained in Macedonia. The increased Turkish Customs dues ought not to be granted until a satisfactory guarantee was given that the money would be used for the benefit of Macedonia. If this could not be obtained the whole scheme of financial reform might fail. UNEMPLOYED, THE.-See under LABOUR. Aug. 1. C-Vaccination. Mr. Lupton (L.) moved a resolution declaring that vaccination ought no longer to be obligatory on those who regarded it as useless or dangerous.- Mr. Burns (L.), Pres. Local Govt. Bd., said that the present law was not well adminis- tered by some magistrates. The cost of vaccination was becoming serious. He thought vaccination might be deferred to a later period than infancy and that super- vision should be transferred to the health authorities. There would be an inquiry into the working of the present law, but there could be no present legislation.-Motion withdrawn. April 25. C-Women Franchise.-Mr. K. Hardie (I. Lab.) moved that sex should cease to be a bar to the exercise of the Parliamentary franchise.-Mr. Cremer (Lab.) opposed. -Mr. Gladstone (L.), Home Secy., said the question would be left to the House to decide. Mr. Evans (L.) followed, arguing strongly against the proposal. (During his speech there were interruptions from the Ladies&apos; Gallery, and it was ultimately cleared by the direction of the Speaker.)-Mr. Evans then talked the subject out. April 25. C-Worcester Election.-On a motion by Sir A. Acland-Hood for the issue of a new writ for the City of Worcester, an amendment deferring the issue of the writ, during the present Session, was carried by 263 to 66. Dec. 17.

Happily, their Majesties the King and Queen of Spain were mercifully preserved from being injured by the outrage committed against them. 6: The recent visit of the King of Norway with the Queen, my daughter, has given me sincere pleasure, and cannot fail to promote friendly relations between the two countries. &amp;quot;My relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly. &amp;quot;The Conference which met at Algeciras, on the invitation of the Sultan, to consider the introduction of reforms into Morocco, concluded its labours by the signature o f &quot; &quot;DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT. 71 PRIVY COUNCIL OFFICE- continued.

PRIVY SEAL, LORD (9, Chelsea Embankment, S. W.) The post of Lord Privy Seal is an ancient office conferring high precedence, but having merely nom- inal functions, and is vacated on a change of Ministry. The duties formerly assigned to this department were abolished by the Act 47 and 48 Vict. c. 30, but the Lord Privy Seal has often been entrusted with the discharge of important work which for any special reason requires the atten- tion of a minister in Parliament. The office, which is often an honorary one, has usually carried with it a seat in the Cabinet, and is so held at present. LORDS PRIVY SEAL SINCE 1867.

THE EDUCATION BILL, 1906-continued. AS IT LEFT THE COMMONS. Where extended facilities are so afforded the local education authority may also, if they think fit, permit the teachers employed in the school to give the instruction desired, but not at the expense of the authority. A local education authority shall take into consideration any application made to them with respect to a school under this section if it is made by the parents of at least twenty children attending the school, and if an application under this section has not been made with respect to the same school during the preceding twelve months, and shall cause a ballot to be taken and hold a public local inquiry with reference thereto, but shall not be under any obligation to take into consideration any application other- wise made to them. Extended facilities shall not be afforded under this section except where the use of the schoolhouse is given, or the schoolhouse is transferred, to the local education authority free of any rent or other payment in respect of the use of the schoolhouse for the purposes of a public elementary school. (2) A permission given under this section may be at any time withdrawn by the local education authority, if, after causing a ballot to be taken and holding a public local inquiry with reference to the matter, they think that the conditions on the strength of which the permission was given no longer obtain; but the withdrawal of a per- mission shall not take effect until the expiration of such period after the date on which the resolution of withdrawal is passed (not being less than twelve months) as the authority may fix, and shall not prevent a permission under this section being again granted in respect of the school on any subsequent application. &quot;&quot; (3) For the purposes of this section, the expression urban area means the county of London and any borough or urban district having in either case a population exceeding five thousand according to the last census for the time being. (4) An application may be made under this section as respects any existing voluntary school for a permission to take effect in the event of the school becoming a transferred voluntary school, and the provisions of this section shall apply in such a case as they apply in the case of a school which has actually become a transferred voluntary school. (5) A ballot for the purposes of this section shall be taken in accordance with AS IT LEFT THE LORDS. parents who declare their objection to the facilities, religious instruc- tion of the character permitted under section fourteen of the Elementary Education Act, 1870. Where extended facilities are afforded, the local education authority shall permit the teachers employed in the school to give the instruction desired if they are willing to do so, but not at the expense of the authority. SO A local education authority shall take into consideration any application made to them with respect to a school under this section if it is made by the owners of the schoolhouse or the parents of at least twenty children attending the school, and if an application under this section has not been made with respect to the same school for facilities for religious instruction of a like special character dur- ing the preceding twelve months, and shall cause a ballot to be taken and hold a public local inquiry with reference there- to, but shall not be under any obligation to take into consideration any application otherwise made to them. Extended facilities shall not be afforded under this section except where the use of the schoolhouse is given, or the school- house is transferred to the local education authority free of any rent or other payment in respect of the use of the schoolhouse for the purposes of a public elementary school and the owners of the schoolhouse shall have power to forego the payment of any rent payable under any agreement, arrangement or order while extended facilities are so afforded. (2) A permission given under this section may be at any time withdrawn by the local education authority, if, after causing a ballot to be taken and holding a public local enquiry with reference to the matter, they think, or in case of dispute with the owners, the Board of Education think that the conditions on the strength of which the permission was given no longer obtain; but the with- drawal of a permission shall not take effect until the expiration of such period after the date on which the resolution of withdrawal is passed (not being less than twelve months) as the authority may fix, and shall not prevent a per- mission under this section being again granted in respect of the school on any subsequent application.

If general compulsory insurance were established, endless difficulties and constant litigation would arise.-The Bill was read a second time and referred to the Standing Committee on Law. April 10. In the Standing Committee, on Cl. 1 (compensation for personal injury by accident to workman arising out of and in the course of employment), Mr. Barnes (Lab.) moved to omit &amp;quot;by accident.&amp;quot;-Withdrawn after discussion.-Mr. Atherley Jones (L.) moved to omit &amp;quot;arising out of and.&amp;quot;-Negatived.-On Cl. 2 (employers not liable in case of disablement for less than a week), Mr. Gill (Lab.) proposed to substitute 3 days.— Mr. Gladstone opposed the amendment, but it was carried. May 3. Mr. H. Tennant (L.) moved to omit the subsection fixing the minimum number of workmen at five.-Mr. Gladstone admitted that the limitations were an injustice to some excluded classes, but the Bill would bring benefits to millions. The Govt. could not introduce compulsory insurance under this Bill, but would consider the question of the admission of other classes, such as shop assistants, clerks, and domestic servants. -Sir W. S. Robson said there was an enormous number of employers who were prac- tically workmen, and one workman could hardly compensate another. The cost of insurance would be prohibitive, and the smaller employers would not insure at all. He admitted the want of logic in the Govt. plan, and said they were willing to leave to the House the best way of dealing with the dilemma.—Eventually the subsection was struck out, and the clause was agreed to.-Cl. 2 (notice of accident) was discussed. May 10. Mr. Cochrane (L.U.) proposed that proceedings should only be maintainable with the leave of a County Court.-Rejected by 31 to 7.-Mr. Cochrane proposed that the notice should be in writing.-This was accepted by Sir W. S. Robson, but opposed by Labour members.—Rejected by 34 to 9.-Several other amendments were negatived, and the clause was agreed to.—On Cl. 3 (contracting out), Mr. Brace (Lab.) moved to omit the clause as impracticable and causing workmen serious disadvantage.—Mr. Gladstone defended the clause as prohibiting employers from putting any pressure on the workmen to contract out on disadvantageous terms. May 15. Mr. Gladstone brought up amendments to modify the clause by additional safeguards to workmen, viz., that any scheme should provide scales of compensation not less favourable than the scales contained in the Act; and that a majority (ascertained by ballot) of the workmen concerned were in favour of it, and would be able to withdraw from it. Mr. Cochrane said this would kill contracting-out by inches, and would prevent a minority from accepting a scheme if they desired to do so.-The amendments were agreed to and the clause passed.-On Cl. 4 (sub-contracting), Sir W. Robson said it gave the workman a remedy against his own employer, and also in certain cases against the person who had made a contract with the latter. It would prevent the principal employer getting rid of his liability by sub-contracting.-Mr. H. Samuel proposed to except agricultural work from the clause.-Agreed to.-The clause was added to the Bill. Also Cls. 5 to 7. May 22. On Cl. 8, Mr. R. Balfour (L.) moved to exclude the application of the Bill to seamen, proposing to substitute another scheme, to be framed by the Board of Trade. There were special risks in the shipping trade, and heavy charges would be incurred in insurance. Mr. Gladstone opposed the amendment, which was negatived.—Mr. H. Banner (C.) moved that the Bill should not apply to apprentices.-Mr. Gladstone declined to differentiate between them and seamen.-Negatived. May 24. The clause extending the Act to seamen was agreed to, with modifications to meet the case of fishermen or joint adventurers.-On Cl. 9 (industrial diseases), Mr. H. Samuel moved a provision that where a workman had persistently disobeyed any regulations for his protection made under an Act, and had so materially conduced to the con- tracting of the disease, compensation should not be payable.—Several legal members criticised the amendment, and thought it would encourage litigation. 66 &amp;quot;&amp;quot; May 29. In the definition clause the term &amp;quot;dependants&amp;quot; is declared to mean such members of the workman&apos;s family as were wholly or in part dependent upon the earnings of the workman at the time of his death, &amp;quot;and as were then resident in the British Islands.&amp;quot; -An amendment by Mr. J. H. Wilson (Lab.) to include in the term dependant any members of the workman&apos;s family wherever resident, who was dependent upon his earnings (the object being to deter shipowners from employing foreigners), was accepted by Mr. Gladstone, and opposed by Mr. Cochrane and others, but was carried by 37 to 10.-On Sch. 1 (scale and conditions of compensation), Mr. Walsh (I ab.) proposed to omit the maximum limit of £300.-Mr. Gladstone said the Govt. were not prepared to alter the scale, which was far in advance of last year&apos;s Bill.-Amendment &quot; &quot;286 PARLIAMENTARY SUMMARY, 1906. C-Africa, South-TRANSVAAL AND ORANGE RIVER COLONY-continued. financial assistance to be given them. Ap lications would only be entertained from those who had served for at least six months, and those who were allowed to return to China would never be allowed to re-enter the Colony. May 3. The Vote for the Colonial Office was discussed in Committee.-Sir J. D.-Poynder (L.) urged the Govt. to increase the number of British settlers in S. Africa, and bring under cultivation large tracts of waste land.—Mr. R. Isaacs (L.) agreed that Lord Milner&apos;s land policy was far-seeing, and urged that the new Colonies should be peopled by white settlers. Sir G. Parker (C.) suggested that the £10,000,000 loan should be issued and part of it used for the purpose of land settlement.-Mr. Churchill said there were obstacles which made it difficult to carry out that object. People were unwilling to face the hardships like the settlers in earlier times. Only 1,300 persons had been settled since the war, at a cost of £2,400,000. Local opinion must be consulted in the matter, and no advantage would arise from pledging the Govt. to a land settlement policy which might be reversed locally.-Mr. Mackarness (L.) complained that Chinese labour was still tolerated, and urged that it should be put an end to.—Mr. Arnold-Forster (L.U.) asked whether the Colonies would be able to exclude British subjects on the ground that they might preponderate over the Boers. (Mr. Churchill said there was a difference between excluding emigrants and encouraging immigration.) It was important to increase the number of British settlers, and if their future was certain, and they did not suffer disabilities, there would be numerous emigrants.-Mr. Walsh (Lab.) moved to reduce the vote as a protes against the continuance of yellow labour.-Mr. Churchill said it was true that only 12 coolies had applied to be repatriated, and he admitted that there was no general desire among them to leave their work, but the objections to Chinese laboui remained, and the power to repatriate would be used energetically. Gambling was a main cause of crime among the Chinese, and extra police were now employed at the cost of the mine-owners. The Govt. trusted that a freely-constituted Transvaal Legislature would put an end to Chinese indentured labour. He hoped that in six weeks a settlement of the Constitution would be announced.-Mr. R. Macdonald (Lab.) declared himself dissatisfied with the Govt.&apos;s action in regard to coolie labour, and in Natal, where a native war was being deliberately provoked; Lord Selborne should be recalled. June 8. L-Lord Elgin stated, in reply to a question, that he could not abrogate the licences for 16,000 coolies issued in the autumn of 1905.-Lord Ripon said the Govt. intended to stop the importation of Chinese labourers at the close of this year, before the new Legislature came into operation. July 6. The The Lord Elgin said the Govt. desired to shorten the delay in constituting the new Transvaal Govt. They declined to publish the West Ridgeway Report. They pro- posed to exclude the Orange River Colony at present. He then announced the main details of their scheme for the Transvaal. There would be a Second Chamber on the Cape model, but the Legislative Council would be nominated by the Crown. war contribution would be left to the High Commissioner to make inquiries. franchise would be withheld from the natives. British interests, in the widest sense, were safe with the Govt. it was proposed to establish.-Lord Milner (L.U.) urged that the Govt. should proceed carefully and circumspectly in regard to constitutional government, and should do everything to press forward the material prosperity of the country. They had neglected both, and were running the risk of seeing the whole executive power falling into the hands of men totally unfit to discharge the duty. The ultimate aim should be federation.-Lord Lansdowne said the Govt. was in too much of a hurry. Why should the Transvaal be given at once re- sponsible government so soon after a great war, when other British Colonies had to wait and go through a period of transition. The franchise would rest on a basis which was thoroughly inequitable, and the allocation of a few votes might put an end to British preponderance. The Boers were gallant but implacable foes, and time alone could heal the breach created by the war. July 31. C-On the Colonial Vote, in Committee of Supply, Mr. Churchill announced the decision of the Govt. in regard to the Transvaal, &amp;quot;the nerve centre of South Africa.&amp;quot; Re- sponsible government was at present not to be granted to the Orange River Colony, He said the Lyttleton Constitution would have been unworkable. H.M. advisers would make no distinction between Boer and Briton, but would give to both the full privileges and rights of British citizenship. They adopted the principles of one vote one value and of manhood suffrage. Adult males who had resided in the Transvaal for six months would vote, by ballot, for the election of members. Officers and soldiers of the British garrison, as well as females, would be excluded. In the electoral divisions the old magisterial districts would be preserved, but there would not be equal electoral areas, but instead, single-member seats, which would be allocated, on the advice 39 1. &quot; &quot;CONSTITUENCIES AND ELECTIONS. 171 ENGLAND-COUNTIES--continued.

The paper concludes with the following telegram dated December 10, 1906, from the Colonial Secretary to the High Commissioner for South Africa :- ·-- Referring to my telegram No. 1 of the 31st July, the Letters Patent granting Responsible Government to the Transvaal and carrying into effect the declarations made by His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the advice they would tender to the Crown, have now been approved by His Majesty. Full information regarding the text of the instrument will be in your hands on the 13th instant, and will be published by you without delay. Publication will take place in this country on the 12th instant. 66 &apos;The instrument itself passed the Great Seal on the 6th instant, and has been despatched by the mail of the 8th. &amp;quot;In announcing to you the transmission of this instrument for promulgation, I am commanded by the King to express through you to the people of the Transvaal his earnest wishes for the peace and prosperity of the country under the new Constitution. &amp;quot;I desire to add on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government that they have advised His Majesty to grant immediate Responsible Government to the Transvaal, in full confidence that under the free institutions established by this Constitution the pros- perity and contentment of the Transvaal and its people will be permanently secured, and with the hope that the steps now taken will in due time lead to the union of the interests of the whole of His Majesty&apos;s dominions in South Africa.&amp;quot; &quot; &quot;326 PARLIAMENTARY SUMMARY, 1906. C-Labour Questions-*TRADE UNION AND TRADES DISPUTES BILL-continued. consented to grant immunity to trade union funds if a corresponding advantage was given to employers.-Mr. Lyttelton (L.U.) pointed out that all actions of tort ågainst unions were to be prohibited, so that there could be no action for damages, ejectment, or nuisance.-Mr. Haldane also justified his position, as he considered that it did not matter how the end was attained, and that the method in the Bill was simpler than the original plan. Mr. B. Law said the Govt. had given way openly and shamelessly to the threats of the Labour members. The privilege which trade unions were to enjoy would injure the interests of unskilled non-unionists: the capit- alists could take care of themselves.-Sir L. Walton (L.), Atty.-Genl., explained his change of view. He still held that the first plan was the better one, but the matter was clearly one for the House to settle. The grievance must be remedied by one method or the other, and the House preferred the present plan. The clause was rejected by 372 to 79.-Lord Castlereagh (C.) proposed that the Bill should not extend to Ireland. Mr. Butcher (C.) said it would facilitate every form of boycotting and intimidation. Mr. J. Redmond repudiated this as a slander on Irishmen.-Mr. Balfour said he was glad to believe that there had been an enormous improvement in Ireland in the last 25 years, but this special legislation ought not to extend to a country which had proved itself capable of losing self-control.-Sir L. Walton asserted that agrarian combinations did not come within the Bill, and that they would not be entitled to its privileges.-Leave to withdraw the clause was refused and it was rejected by 289 to 4.-An amendment that only a reasonable number &amp;quot; of persons should be entitled to picket&amp;quot; a house was rejected by 347 to 72. Nov. 1. 66 66 66 Mr. F. E. Smith (C.) moved to confer the right on an individual employer as well as on combinations of employers.-Sir L. Walton agreed.-Mr. Balfour said there might be just as much to fear from great combinations of employers as of workmen.— The word peacefully” having been inserted in another part of the clause to make it plain that the pickets must act only for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, he recommended that the clause should be allowed to pass.-Sir F. Banbury moved to prevent the picketing of persons not actually con- cerned in a trade dispute, e.g., the relatives of a non-unionist.-Sir L. Walton con- tended that the amendment was not necessary, to which Mr. Balfour replied that if the clause would leave the law as it was, the House ought not to waste its time in making that lawful which was already lawful. The amendment was negatived by 298 to 50.--Mr. Rawlinson moved that picketing should not be permitted at or neat a man&apos;s residence.-Negatived by 320 to 58.-Mr. Rawlinson moved to strike our the words sanctioning the picketing of a person in any place where he might happen to be. Mr. Balfour feared the possible abuse of the rights conferred by the clause.- Sir L. Walton said it would be absurd to prohibit waiting for a man who might be in a shop, when it would be lawful to wait for him near his own home or place of business. If, however, a crowd waited for him, the object would clearly be intimidation and the Court would infer it.-Amendment rejected by 317 to 44.-The clause was carried after closure. Nov. 2. Sir F. Banbury moved the rejection of Cl. 3 on the ground that this right of inter- ference with the liberties of other people was likely to be abused.-Negatived after debate. Sir F. Banbury moved to omit Cl. 4.-Sir L. Walton denied that it created a new class privilege, the sole object being to perpetuate the historical traditions of the last 30 years.-Mr. Lyttelton said he understood that injunctions against trade unions would be prohibited and, therefore, it would be impossible to restrain them from perpetrating wrong.-Mr. Balfour said that the Govt. amendments would enable trade union officials to do wrong and to continue their action.-The clause was passed by 342 to 72.-Sir L. Walton proposed to extend the protection accorded to trade unions to protection against injunctions.-Carried by 312 to 45.-Mr. Lambton moved to limit the clause to the parties immediately concerned in trade disputes, so that rights of action by the public should not be prejudiced.—Negatived. The Bill was ordered for 3rd R. Nov. 5. &amp;quot;trade On the 3rd R., Lord R. Cecil moved the recommittal of the Bill in order that a dispute&amp;quot; should not include an agrarian dispute, so as not to sanction boycotting in Ireland. Sir L. Walton repeated the assurance that the Bill was not intended to apply to such matters. but that a dispute in any part of the kingdom in regard to the terms and conditions of agricultural employment would be a trade dispute.-Motion rejected by 220 to 46.-Mr. Balfour said he should not divide against the 3rd R., as some altera- tion of the law was necessary to protect the benevolent funds of trade unions. The responsibility must rest on the Govt., who had brought in this Bill and transformed it during its progress.-Sir L. Walton again justified his action in consenting to the alteration of his Bill, saying that the great interests of statesmanship were not to be sacrificed to the self-esteem of Ministers.-The Bill was read a third time.

AS IT LEFT THE LORDS. Provision of New Schools with Facilities for Special Religious Instruction. 6.-(1) If any persons consider that a new public elementary school with facilities for religious instruction of some special character not permitted under section fourteen of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, is required in any district, they may give public notice of their intention to provide a schoolhouse for the proposed school. (2) When such notice has been given the Board of Education shall determine whether the proposed school is required, and in so doing, shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the interest of secular instruction, the wishes of the parents as to the religious education of their children, and the economy of the rates, and shall take into consideration any appeal made to them against the proposal by the local edu- cation authority, or any ten ratepayers in the district for which the school is claimed to be required, and shall hold a public inquiry under section seventy- three of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, with reference to the proposal if requested to do so by the appellants. (3) If the Board of Education deter- mine that the proposed school is required, an arrangement under section two of this Act or an order under section eleven of this Act shall be made in respect of the schoolhouse as soon as it is ready for occupation as though it were the school- house of an existing voluntary school, and the provisions of this Act with respect to facilities (including extended facilities) shall apply to the school. When the powers of the Commission appointed under this Act have expired, the Board of Education shall, without prejudice to any other power, have the same power to make an order with respect to a schoolhouse provided under this section as the Commission originally had.

During the same period, 1,077,000,000 news- papers, book packets, circulars, and samples, 800,300,000 post cards and 100,579,014 parcels were delivered. The total amount for which Money Orders were issued for payment in the United Kingdom in 1905 was £36,357,316. Postal Orders to the amount of over £38,019,000 were issued in the year ending 31st March, 1906. *For the purchase of the Telegraphs by the State, about £11,000,000 had to be borrowed; and when the interest on this sum is added to the cost of the service, it is seen that in the financial year 1905-06 there was a de- ficiency of about £834,047. Over 92,600,000 telegraphic messages were transmitted in the year 1905-06. There was also a balance of £41,091 at the beginning of the year 1905-06, making a total of £667,045 for that year. Of this amount £154,901 was expended, and £480,000 was paid into the Exchequer, leaving a balance of £32,143 in the hands of the Commis- sioners of Woods, &amp;amp;c., at the end of the year.

Oct. 31. The Duke of Devonshire declined to support the amendment as too wide. He deprecated causing disturbance in a great number of council schools which were working satisfactorily.-Lord Lansdowne said the facilities could only be given after local inquiry, and that he supported the principle of the amendment, but, also, did not wish for needless interference with the council schools.-The Bp. of Salisbury advocated giving facilities all round.-Lord Goschen said there was great anxiety as to the 6,000 council schools, but there were 14,000 voluntary schools whose position ought to be considered.-Lord Crewe said the effect would be in rural districts that the local authority would have to pay for denominational teaching given by a Church teacher.— Lord St. Aldwyn objected to the amendment as it went beyond the necessities of the case.-Lord Balfour did not press his amendment, and it was withdrawn.-The Bp. of Hereford moved that in any rural parish where there was only one elementary school, and the parents of a reasonable number of children required special facilities for religious instruction, such should be afforded.-The amendment was agreed to after debate. The Bp. of Oxford moved to strike out the words limiting religious instruction to two mornings a week.-Carried by 141 to 49. Nov. 1. On Cl. 3 (ordinary facilities for special religious instruction), the Abp. of Canterbury moved that when any question arose between persons supplying religious instruction and the local authority, it should be decided by the Bd. of Education.-Agreed to.— The clause was agreed to.- On Cl. 4 (extended facilities for special religious instruction), Lord Heneage moved to strike out &quot; may &quot; and insertshall,&quot; making it compulsory on local authorities to afford extended facilities.-Lord Fitzmaurice argued that the clause was inserted to meet the views of Roman Catholics, Jews, and the Church of England, and that confidence should be shown in the local authorities.-The amend- ment was carried by 157 to 46.-Lord Jersey (C.) moved that the extended facilities should not be confined to &quot;urban areas.&quot;-Lord Crewe said the minority in country districts were not so well able to defend themselves in political and religious matters as in towns. This justified the distinction.-The amendment was carried by 180 to 44. Nov. 5. Various amendments dealing with the manner of providing facilities were discussed.— Lord Cawdor moved to omit the words relating to the ballot of parents.-Lord Fitz- maurice said the Govt. would consider how to find other means of meeting the difficulty -Amendment withdrawn.-Lord Jersey moved that if the majority of the parents desired extended facilities they should be granted.-Lord Crewe strongly opposed the amendment, holding that undenominational education should prevail, unless special religious instruction was desired by the parents of four-fifths of the children.— Lord Lansdowne said the Govt. proposed that a school, the whole character of which had been denominational, encouraged and supported as such, and one which had met the requirements of the locality, should, in order to meet the views of the minority, have its character entirely transformed.-Lord Ripon said there was no chance whatever of its being accepted by the House of Commons.-The Bp. of London asked whether, if a few Nonconformist children were in a school, they should be able to break down its denominational character.-The amendment was carried by 196 to 48, and a subsequent proposal by Lord Camperdown to substitute two-thirds for a bare majority was defeated by 133 to 83.-Lord Cawdor proposed that any child whose parent declared his desire for some other form of religious instruction than that for which facilities were afforded, should be provided for.-Carried by 152 to 42.-Lord Cadogan (C.) moved that some form of religious instruction other than that for which extended facilities had been obtained might be given to the minority in a school, with the authority of the Bd. of Education.-Lord Crewe declined to accept this plan of &quot;facilities all round.&quot; Nov. 6. 66 &quot;&quot; On Cl. 5 (extended facilities), Lord Ashbourne moved that where the owners of the school were dissatisfied with the mode in which extended facilities were afforded they might appeal to the Bd. of Education.-Agreed to.-A long discussion arose on a proposal to omit the provision by which 20 parents were allowed to appeal to the Board to continue a school as a State-aided school. The clause was added to the Bill.--On Cl. 6 (facilities to future schools), Lord Crewe explained that the object was to secure that a school to be taken over was a going concern.-The clause was, &apos; &apos;462 NATIONAL INCOME 1 NATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE, 1905-1906.

If the local education authority at any time make an arrangement for the transfer to them, or the use by them, of the schoolhouse of an elementary school not being a public elementary school and conduct it as a public elementary school provided by them, the foregoing pro- visions of this Act with respect to facilities (including extended facilities) shall apply to that school in the same manner as they apply to a transferred voluntary AS IT LEFT THE LORDS. facilities are afforded by the local education authority, and desire that, in lieu of any other remedy, such an order should be made; provided that in no case shall such an order be made unless the owners of the schoolhouse consent, and the Com- mission are satisfied that the estimated income of the school from endowments, fees, and voluntary contributions will secure a standard of maintenance not inferior to that of the public elementary schools in the area. The order may provide so far as necessary for the cancelling of any arrangement or order made with respect to the transfer or use of the schoolhouse, and for any other matter for which provision is required in connection with the order of the Commission under this section. (2) Where an order is made under this section allowing a school to continue as a state-aided school, the Board of Education may, notwithstanding any- thing in this or any other Act, pay to that school the parliamentary grants which would be payable in respect of the school or the scholars in the school if it was a public elementary school, so long as the Board are satisfied that the regulations contained in paragraphs one, two, and three of section seven of the Elementary Education Act, 1870 (a copy of which shall be conspicuously put up in the school), and such other conditions as they prescribe as conditions for the payment of the grant, are complied with in the case of the school. A state-aided school shall not be treated as a public elementary school except for the purpose of the Elementary School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1898, and any other purpose which may be prescribed by the Board of Education. When the powers of the Commission have expired, the Board of Education shall, without prejudice to any other power, have the same power to make an order under this section as the Com- mission originally had.

W. D. Ward, K.C.B. (For names of the Army Council, see under Executive Government, ante.) ATTORNEY-GENERAL, THE (543, Royal Courts, W.C.), is the chief Law Officer of the Crown, and is appointed by letters patent under the Great Seal. He is a member of the Government, and almost necessarily must be in the House of Commons. He represents the Crown in the courts of law, prosecutes by himself or by his nominee in criminal cases, exhibits informations in revenue cases in the Exchequer, and takes proceedings on behalf of those who come ur der the prc- tection of the Crown as parens patriæ, such as lunatics, or the objects of a charitable trust. Legal questions are constantly referred for his opinion by the different Government offices. When the House of Lords is sitting as a Committee of privileges in peerage cases, he is present in a judicial capacity to express the view s of the Crown on any point which may arise. Letters patent for inventions are considered to be issued under his general superintendence, and under the patent laws appeals from the Comptroller may in certain cases be brought to him. He is the official head of the Bar, and to him all ques- tions of professional etiquette are referred. Under an arrangement made in 1895, the Law Officers are precluded from ap- pearing on behalf of private clients, and a clerical staff is assigned to them. ………………...... ........ 1873 ....1874 ATTORNEY-GENERALS SINCE 1867.

THE EDUCATION BILL, 1906-continued. local authorities jurisdiction in these matters. If the Government really take the view of the autonomy which ought to be given to every local authority in this country if they really believe that local authorities should be free to deal with these questions, why do not they act upon their own theory, and why do they leave to local authorities the right to refuse to take over a Clause 4 school, or, may be, even a Clause 3 school, and refuse to the local authority the right to give or to allow other teaching within the limit of their own schools than that which is prescribed by what is called the Cowper-Temple clause ? WHY IS THE FREEDOM TO BE ALL ON ONE SIDE AND NOT ON THE OTHER? WHY ARE THEY TO BE ALLOWED TO BE ANTI-DENOMINATIONAL IN ONE RESPECT, BUT NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO BE DENOMINA- TIONAL IN THE OTHER ? WHY IS THE FREEDOM TO BE WHOLLY ONE-SIDED? WHAT CONSISTENCY IS THERE? What belief are we to place in their professions with regard to local authorities when we see them arbitrarily dividing the things a local authority may do from what it may not do, and putting into the class of things they may do everything which can injure a denomination, and in the class of things they may not do everything which can benefit a denomination? TEACHERS AND TESTS. As the Bill went up Now we come to the much contested case of the teachers. from the House of Commons to the House of Lords it was not allowed in Clause 3 schools that teachers should be permitted to teach denominational religion No man interested in the teaching of religion would do other than deeply regret that that teaching was to be handed over to those who, whatever their other qualifications may be, are in matters scholastic necessarily amateurs. And WHAT IS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR IT? THE REAL JUSTIFICATION, I SUPPOSE, IS THAT IT IS A DIRECT BLOW AIMED AT CHURCH OF England TEACHING; but that is not the avowed justification. What is the avowed justification? The avowed justification is that to allow a teacher to teach religion is in some way imposing or suggesting the imposition of what are called-most improperly called-religious tests. Now, that is folly. Observe, under the Government plan they are going to permit teachers in Board schools-I use the old phrase because it is most easily intelligible-to teach under the Cowper-Temple clause. I put this dilemma, and I shall be glad to know how it is going to be met-EITHER COWPER-TEMPLE TEACHING IS NOT RELIGIOUS OUT IMPOSING RELIGIOUS TESTS. Now, which of those alternatives are the Government going to accept ? WHY DO YOU VIOLATE RELIGIOUS TESTS BY PERMITTING A TEACHER TEACHING OR ELSE TEACHERS MAY BE ALLOWED TO TEACH RELIGION IN SCHOOLS WITH- WHO DESIRES TO TEACH DENOMINATIONAL RELIGION WHEN YOU DO NOT VIOLATE THOSE TESTS WHEN HE TEACHES UNDENOMINATIONAL RELIGION? Both are religion. Both require, as I think, the same belief-I mean the same belief in higher things, the same belief in the great fundamental truths of religion; and why you should allow it in the case of Cowper-Temple teaching and arbitrarily refuse it in the case of Church teaching I am entirely unable to understand, nor do I believe that any reason can be given for it except the reason which I have already suggested-namely, that this a Bill not intended to favour either religious equality or religious education, but that it is aimed solely at a particular denomination. THE MAIN GROUNDS. It is in the main on the grounds I have indicated-because Clause 3 and Clause 4 are made compulsory, because religious teaching is to be allowed to be given by the teacher, because the arbitrary area within which Clause 4 schools are allowed is to he extended-it is mainly on those grounds that the Government are so indignant with the House of Lords. · · ENDOWMENT, FORSOOTH! When we are told that a Bill in which these changes have taken place, in which the amendments of the kind I have indicated are introduced, that that Bill has become an endowment of denominationalism-that is the charge put forward, I believe, in those very words by the Minister of Education and others of his colleagues-what does that mean? Has the phrase any meaning? · The House of Lords have not touched the provision in the Bill which requires every denomination to pay for its own denominational teaching. Every shilling expended either in a Clause 3 or a Clause 4 school, in teaching denominational religion is a shilling taken from the pockets of the denomination. Compare that with the treatment which is meted out under the Bill to those who desire religious teaching but not denominational religious teaching for their children--who desire what is commonly &quot; &quot;POLITICAL NOTES. 417 THE EDUCATION BILL, 1906-continued.

Balfour described the Budget speech as requiring most careful consideration, and questioned the policy of abolishing loans for military or naval works as possibly resulting in neglect of needful preparations. It was a small thing to reduce the unfunded debt by half a million. He warned the Govt. of the danger of making considerable reductions in the Army and Navy. As to the Debt in 1871, when the population was much smaller, it was the same as now. Therefore the financial position could not be so very deplorable as Mr. Asquith declared. No reduction of expenditure was possible in the near future in view of growing demands for education and social reforms. Parliament would sooner or later be forced to reconsider the question of the basis of taxation.-A general discussion followed and some formal financial motions were agreed to. April 30. Mr. Asquith stated that the date for the remission of the tea duty would be altered to 14th July.-Mr. J. Redmond (N.) discussed the financial relations with Ireland, arguing that Ireland was overtaxed. Mr. Asquith replied that he earnestly desired to contribute from Imperial sources all that could possibly be expected on any principle of justice. He admitted a grievance on the question of education. A general in- vestigation would be made by the Govt.-Mr. A. Balfour reverted to the question of military loans, and claimed that the late Govt. had completed or begun all the great works necessary to our security, but that was no reason for laying down a permanent principle against loans, which would involve danger to the country. Future national emergencies could only be dealt with by large powers of capital expenditure, and it would be folly to declare that no defensive works would be sanctioned except such as could be paid for out of current taxation. Mr. J. Chamberlain (L.U.) claimed that the surplus was a Unionist surplus, and contrasted the small amount of economy proposed with the lavish promises of the Liberals at the general election. There was no provision for reductions in the Army, Navy, or Civil Service, nothing for old age pensions, and very little for the National Debt. The abolition of the coal tax was a gift to the foreigner, and the penny off the tea duty would go into the pockets of the trade. The income-tax payers were put off with a Committee. They had promised a million for education-for the purpose of endowing a new religion.—Mr. Asquith in reply denied that he had closed the door to borrowing for defensive works, but the system was liable to abuse and had been abused. The reduced tax on tea would relieve the consumers and the colonial producers.-The resolution in favour of the reduction of the tea duty was agreed to. May 1. On Report of the tea duty resolution Mr. J. Chamberlain pointed out that dealers would suffer loss through the change of date from 1st July to 14th July.-Mr. Asquith promised to remedy any grievance that might exist. *FINANCE BILL.-The Bill was read a first time. May 2. On the 2nd R. Mr. V. Cavendish (L.U.) complained that Mr. Asquith had frittered away his surplus.—Mr. Trevelyan (L.) argued for more control over local taxation and in favour of taxing land values. Mr. J. Chamberlain said that the Liberal programme would require a great deal of money, and it could not be got without extending the basis of taxation. Land values should not be confiscated, and if only moderately taxed they would produce little. The Budget was composite; and intended to satisfy the demands of different interests. The coal tax did not injure the consumer. The reduction of the tea duty was too small, and the working classes would not derive any benefit from it. The reduction of duty on stripped tobacco left in force other tobacco duties which were admittedly protective, and might deprive some 8,400 people of their work.-Mr. Asquith admitted that our tobacco duties were protective, but said they had long existed and produced very large revenue. change he had made was desired by the trade. As to the export coal duty, no working miner admitted that the coal owner and the foreigner only would benefit. The cost of remitting the tea duty would be about one million. He was able to set aside £13,500,000 for the reduction of the National Debt.-Read a second time. The May 16. In Committee, on the clause reducing the tea duty, Mr. Courthope (C.) moved a further reduction of one penny.-Mr. Asquith said it was impossible at that time.— Mr. A. Chamberlain thought the estimates of revenue were too small in view of the revival of trade, and that the tea duty might be reduced. He repeated the grievances of the income-tax payers.-Amendment negatived (255 to 150). An amendment to omit the clause dealing with stripped tobacco was rejected by 266 to 44.-Mr. Harwood (L.) opposed the clause abolishing the coal duty, which, however, was passed. -The Bill passed through Committee. May 29. On the 3rd R. Capt. Craig moved an amendment in favour of the taxation of imported foreign manufactured articles.-The debate was carried on for some time in the absence of the leaders of the Opposition, and a division was forced by the Labour &quot; &quot;84 HOUSE OF LORDS. Lords. The restriction has now been so fully established, that in 1865 a proposed alteration by the House of Lords in the local authority which under the Cattle Plague Bill was to have power to assign pecuniary compensation for Cattle slaughtered, was withdrawn on the ground of privilege. In 1891, also, an amend- ment to the Education Bill, which might indirectly have increased the rates, and in 1904 an amendment to the Licensing Bill, were objected to in the House of Commons. The abstract right of rejecting a money Bill is admitted; but the rejection, in 1860, of the Paper Duty Repeal Bill by the House of Lords led next year to the inclusion of all the financial measures of the year in a single Bill, which could only be accepted or rejected en bloc. This practice has since prevailed. The House of Commons has sometimes endeavoured to force measures upon the House of Lords by &amp;quot;tacking&amp;quot; extraneous matters upon a Bill of Supply, which, if rejected, would cause public inconvenience. This practice is admitted to be unconsti- tutional, but was successfully resorted to under William III., and was also attempted later with regard to an &amp;quot;Occasional Conformity Bill.&amp;quot; To mitigate some practical inconveniences, Bills of a partly financial character are occasionally passed through the House of Lords with &amp;quot;red- letter clauses,&amp;quot; explaining the money provisions intended. These are struck out before the Bill leaves the House, and are re-inserted in the Commons. Private Bills, if opposed, are referred to committees of five members, nominated by a Committee of Selection, over which the Chairman of Committees presides. No peer is compelled to serve on such a committee, but if he consents to serve he must attend during the hearing of the whole case. The House of Lords possesses, like the Lower House, power to commit for con- tempt of its authority, and to protect its officers from molestation in the execution of its orders. It has also power to punish by fine and imprisonment persons guilty of breach of privilege, or of libels upon the House or its members. In the exercise of these powers it claims all the authority of a Court of Record. It exercises the right of deciding, by a Report to the Crown, on claims to sit or vote in the House, or to vote at the elect- ion of Scotch or Irish representative peers. The case, if disputed, is heard before a Committee of Privileges, at which any peer may attend, and on which some non-legal peers have often sat. The judgment is usually delivered by the Law Lords and the Chairman of Com- mittees alone, though sometimes a lay peer who has heard the whole case has also delivered his opinion. A Select Committee of the House of Commons, to whom the question of the succession of Visct. Wolmer, M.P., to the Earldom of Selborne was referred in 1895, reported as follows:- 1st. That the succession to a peerage of England, Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, disables the person so succeeding from sitting or voting in the House of Commons. 2nd. That as the calling up to the House of Lords by writ of summons is the best and safest proof of his succes- sion, the general practice of the House of Commons has been to abstain from declaring the seat of the new peer vacant. But as, in the case of a Scotch Peerage, the succession does not entitle the holder to a seat in the House of Lords, and there is, therefore, no writ of summons, the House of Commons has been in the habit, in such a case, of declaring the seat vacant, upon good and satisfactory evidence of the death of the predecessor and succession of the member affected. 3rd. That when a member who has succeeded to a peerage entitling him to a seat in the House of Lords refuses or delays to apply for a writ of summons, the House of Commons may ascertain the fact of the succession by such inquiry or evidence as it considers necessary. The peers of Scotland and Ireland, since the unions with the two kingdoms, sit only by representation, the Scotch having sixteen, the Irish twenty-eight represen- tatives. The Scotch representative peers are chosen at the commencement of every new Parliament. The Irish representa- tive peers are elected for life on the occurrence of vacancies. Many Scotch and Irish peers, however, sit by English titles. A Scotch peer, not a representa- tive, cannot be elected to the House of Commons. An Irish peer may be elected for any constituency not in Ireland, but, like all other peers, is not entitled to be placed on the register of Parliamentary electors, or to vote at a Parliamentary election. As bearing on this point a debate in the House of Lords on the Finance Bill, July 26, 1894, may be referred to. &amp;quot;The legal right of the House of Lords, as a co-ordinate branch of the Legislature, to withhold their assent from any Bill whatsoever to which their concurrence is desired, is unquestionable.”—May&apos;s Parl.

L-Fiscal Policy-continued. add appreciably to the cost of living, but he admitted that the people of this country had not accepted them. He trusted that Unionists would find something better to do than mere recrimination.-Lord Goschen (C.) held that if Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s propaganda was to go on, its opponents must place their views before the country. He appealed to the Govt. particularly to have this question about the 12 or 13 millions thoroughly examined into.—Lord Crewe (L.) denied that trade was in an unsatisfactory Feb. 22. condition. C-The 12 o&apos;clock rule having been suspended (362 to 113), Sir J. Kitson (L.) moved a free-trade resolution declaring that the House would &amp;quot;resist any proposal, whether by way of taxation upon foreign corn or of the creation of a general tariff upon foreign goods, to create in this country a system of protection.&amp;quot; The object, he said, was to give the House an opportunity to dispose of the free-trade issue once and for all.- The Govt. had Mr. A. Balfour (C.) described the resolution as a vote of censure. done a foolish thing by wasting time on an unnecessary controversy. The House was invited to pledge itself for six years at least to a resolution full of ambiguities, which he pointed out by a series of questions. No Govt. could say with certainty that for six years there would be no urgent demands upon the Exchequer arising from war or other causes.-No Minister replying, Mr. J. Chamberlain pressed for an answer. As it stood the resolution was nonsense. He moved the adjournment of the debate.— Sir H. C.-Bannerman said he had no direct answers to give to Mr. Balfour&apos;s questions, which were futile, nonsensical, and misleading. They were invented to occupy time, and he had had &amp;quot;erough of this foolery.&amp;quot;-Mr. A. Chamberlain (L.U.) said the Govt. ought to say whether the Indian system would be considered by them as protective in this country, and whether the resolution condemned the protection now given to cocoa and tobacco.-The adjournment was negatived by 405 to 115.-Mr. Snowden (Soc.) argued that neither free trade nor protection would enable the country to solve the grave problems of poverty. Large measures of social reform were essential.— Mr. Ll.-George said the resolution would record formally that protection would be injurious to the interests of the nation. Free trade would not remove all the evils under which the people suffered. Social reforms would not be lost sight of. But under free trade we were, in the neutral markets of the world, beating all our protectionist competitors, because we could obtain the best raw materials at the cheapest price. A tariff would destroy a large part of our export trade.-Sir E. Clarke (C.) deplored the proposal for a tax upon corn, and said that tariff reform might imperil far greater causes. He believed that the people would sooner vote for Home Rule than for a March 12. tax on corn or meat. 66 Mr. Wortley (C.) moved to omit the words affirming that the &amp;quot;people had demon- strated their unqualified fidelity to the principles and practice of free trade.&amp;quot; There were many causes which contributed to the result of the elections, including Chinese slavery,&amp;quot; the education and licensing questions, and the promises of economy.- Mr. Balfour said that the words were a gratuitous addition to a gratuitous motion, and the latter should be made to conform more nearly with the facts.-Sir W. Robson denied that the election had turned largely on Chinese labour, and justified the Liberal leaflets on the subject.-Mr. K. Hardie (Soc.) said the Labour members accepted free trade as an existing fact, but asserted a policy of restriction in respect to land and capital in the interests of the people. They had not won their seats on free trade but social reform.—The amendment was rejected by 445 to 118.—Mr. Wyndham (C.) proposed a further amendment to omit the words directed against taxation on foreign corn or a general tariff on foreign goods, and to add words condemning artificial protection, but in favour of considering any scheme framed for purposes of revenue or to secure more equal terms of competition for British trade and closer commercial union with the Colonies. The Unionists, he said, did not desire to bolster up home industries by protection against legitimate competition, but changes would be necessary in the fiscal system. In neutral markets we were holding our own, but there was no security that as to some of these markets protection would not be established in the future. It would, therefore, be unwise to declare that in no circumstances would we consider any scheme for securing preference in Canada and other Colonies, or for imposing new taxes, if necessary, for Imperial defence and domestic reform. The Unionist ideal was to secure fair returns for the labourer and workman at home and to draw the ties of Empire closer. Our fiscal system must fall when the revenue from alcohol fell off, or when the Govt. attempted to fulfil their promises. The House ought therefore not to tie its hands.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman moved the closure, which was carried by a majority of 348, and the original resolution was agreed to by 474 to 98. March 13. &quot; &quot;445 LIST OF BOOKS.

The The House of Lords is by far the more ancient of the two Houses of Parliament, being derived from the King&apos;s Great Council as it existed in the reigns imme- diately following the Conquest. Of this Council the constitution and powers seem not to have been precisely defined, and there is some difference of opinion as to what they really were in practice. It included magnates ecclesiastical and tem- poral, bishops, abbots, earls, barons, and apparently other persons of distinction, summoned by the king. In early times it seems likely that all tenants-in-chief of the king received the summons, which later was only issued directly to the greater tenants holding baronies, while the lesser, summoned through the sheriff of the county, and appearing by repre- sentation, were the germ of the knights of the shires in the Lower House. creation of baronies by patent, apart from tenure, dates from the latter part of the fourteenth century. The effect of a sum- mons by writ in creating a peerage in early times has been a matter of some question. It seems that some persons were summoned by, writ for one parlia- ment, and not again, others were summoned individually, but not their descendants. The same irregularity, however, is found in the issue of writs to boroughs for the election of members of the House of Commons for some time after the commencement of its existence, so that it is difficult to draw the line in this matter between constitutional and arbitrary exercises of prerogative. was held in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, in accordance with what had gradually become an established custom, that a writ of summons conveyed a hereditary peerage. Such a peerage is considered to descend to heirs general; it goes into abeyance in the case of a peer so created having several daughters, until it is called out of abeyance by the Crown as the descendants of all but one co-heiress are extinct. It thus differs from the usual rule of English patents descending to heirs male only, and from that of some Scotch peerages descending to an elder daughter. In the case of the Earl of Arundel, in 1626, it was decided by the House that every peer of full age is entitled to his summons, and that the House should refuse to proceed to busi- ness in case such summons to any peer is omitted. That the Crown no longer possesses the right of creating a life peer- age, conferring a seat and vote in the It The House, was decided in the well-known case of Lord Wensleydale in 1856. only temporal lords sitting without hereditary peerages are the past and present Lords of Appeal created under the Acts regulating the appellate juris- diction of the House, passed in 1876 and 1887. These lords hold the rank of Barons for life, and may sit and vote after resignation of their offices. APPELLATE JURISDICTION. The Appellate jurisdiction of the House has its origin in the practice of appealing for justice to the King in Parliament. Petitions of this kind were addressed to the King in the Great Council, but after the establishment of the Courts at West- minster, such petitions were ordinarily referred to the proper Court. The Lords and the Privy Council appear to have exercised certain judicial powers jointly. The Lords exercised a right of appellate jurisdiction down to the reign of Henry IV, and after some disuse, it was resumed in that of Elizabeth. In 1585, the establishment of the Court of Ex- chequer Chamber, as intermediate between the Common Law Courts and the House of Lords, definitely recognised its right to hear appeals from those Courts. The House of Lords in the following century claimed in some cases even an original jurisdiction. But two cases in the reign of Charles II, which created for the time a violent conflict between the Houses- those of Skinner v. the East India Com- pany and Shirley v. Sir John Fagg- ended by the defeat in the first case of the claim to original jurisdiction, and the establishment in the second of the right to entertain appeals from Courts of Equity as well as of Common Law. This jurisdiction, originally exercised by the whole House, or any members who chose to attend, has, since the case of O&apos;Connell&apos;s appeal (1844), been left to the Law Lords-that is, the Chancellor and other peers holding, or having held, high legal positions. By the more recent Acts, as before mentioned, the Lords of Appeal are especially appointed to exercise this jurisdiction, under the presidency of the Lord Chancellor. But any other legal peer, and, theoretically, any peer what- ever, retains the right to attend and deliver judgment. THE LORDS SPIRITUAL.

Lord Fitzmaurice stated that the Russian Government had intimated that, in view of the political situation, the presence of foreign ships might give rise to un- pleasant agitation, and therefore the proposed cruise of a British fleet in the Baltic had been abandoned. July 16. C-Sir E. Grey disclaimed on the part of the Govt. any responsibility for the proceedings of certain members of Parliament and others who had contemplated visiting Russia for the purpose of presenting an address to the representatives of the late Duma. Oct. 25. C-Scotland.-LAND VALUES BILL.-Mr. Sutherland (L.) moved the 2nd R. of a Bill for the valuation of sites, and the imposition of a rate up to 2s. in the £ on such values. -Mr. H. Cox (L.) moved its rejection as a part of a campaign against private property in land with the real object of forcing owners to sell at a low price. It would, he said, inflict hardship on thousands of people of scanty means who had invested their savings in land. Sir H. Craik (C.) laid stress on the confiscatory nature of the Bill, which he opposed in the interests of educational and charitable institutions and trade unions. If there were cases in which land was capriciously kept out of the market, they could be met by increasing the compulsory power of purchase vested in local authorities. --Mr. Shaw (L.), Ld. Advocate, said the times were ripe for this reform. The Bill would have a good effect on the housing problem. He would propose to exempt existing contracts.-Mr. Whittaker (L.) denied that it would bring building land into the market. Mr. Cochrane (L.U.) argued that it would discourage the expenditure of capital and good management, and it would impede the creation of garden cities and open spaces.-The closure having been carried by a majority of 268, the amend- ment was rejected and the 2nd R. was carried by 319 to 61. March 23. SMALL HOUSES.-In the debate on the Address, Mr. Cross (L.U.) moved an amendment asking for an alteration of the law and practice regulating the letting of small houses in Scottish burghs.--Withdrawn after debate. Feb. 20. C-Sea Encroachment.-In the debate on the Address, Mr. A. S. Wilson (C.) moved an amendment referring to the serious encroachments of the sea on the British coast. -Mr. Ll.-George (L.), Pres. Bd. of Trade, said the Govt. would appoint a Commission at an early date and would include the reclamation of waste lands and probably afforestation.-Amendment withdrawn. Feb. 26. L-Shipping.—-ALIENS BILL.-Lord Muskerry (C.) moved the 2nd R. of a Bill to prevent aliens from obtaining control of British ships and property.-Lord Granard (L.) moved its rejection.-Lord Tweedmouth (L.) thought it was too severe to declare that foreigners should not be employed; but it was desirable to encourage the employ- ment of British subjects.-The Bill was withdrawn. May 18. C-LIGHT DUES BILL.-Sir R. Ropner (C.) moved the 2nd R. of the Light Dues (Abolition) Bill, to throw the cost of lighting our coasts upon the Exchequer. The Royal Navy, he said, contributed nothing towards the expense of coast lighting.— After a long debate, Mr. Ll.-George (L.), Pres. Bd. of Trade, said it would cost £500,000 a year to abolish the dues. He supported the principle of this Bill in other years, but was now bound to consider the subject from a practical point of view. The Govt. were not prepared to carry it into effect.-Mr. Chamberlain said the shipping interest ought, in the first instance, to pay the dues, which subsequently they could put upon the freighters.-The Bill was rejected by 169 to 142. May 4. *MERCHANT SHIPPING BILL.-Mr. Ll.-George (L.), Pres. Bd. of Trade, introduced a Govt. Bill on this subject based, he said, on the reports of three committees. It dealt with questions of overladen and unseaworthy foreign ships in British ports by applying to them, after a sufficient interval, the regulations as to overloading and unseaworthiness applicable to British ships. In regard to the stowage of grain and life-saving appliances, the British standard would also be imposed on them. If, how- ever, the Board of Trade should be satisfied that the regulations of any foreign country were substantially equal to our own, the Department would have power to exempt the vessels of that country. He said that whereas in 1870 there were 200,000 British sailors in our merchant ships and 18,000 foreigners, there were now 176,000 Britons, 39,000 aliens, and 42,000 Lascars. An adequate supply of British seamen could not be obtained sufficient to meet the amazing growth of the mercantile marine. The engagement of foreigners could not be prohibited without the risk of ruin. Something more might be done to attract British seamen to British ships. The Bill also provided &quot; &quot;POLITICAL NOTES. 429 THE EDUCATION BILL, 1906-continued. THE MAIN POINTS OF THE CONTROVERSY. You all know that as regards what are now voluntary schools the Government proposes two kinds of treatment, which you may call Clause 4 and Clause 3 treatment respectively, Clause 4 treatment being intended to satisfy the Roman Catholics and the Jews, and (as I understand Mr. Birrell) a certain number of the extreme clergy of the Church of England, Clause 3 treatment being thought good enough for the Church of England as a whole. CLAUSE 4 SCHOOLS. Now, what are the changes which the Government propose as regards Clause 4 schools, the schools which are, by the confession of the Government themselves, intended to remain with a denominational complexion, chiefly for the purpose of satisfying the Roman Catholics and the Jews? What the House of Lords have done with regard to those schools is, in the first place, to say that what the Government profess they ought to be they shall be; that as regards the particular sections of the community whom they desire to satisfy by Clause 4 schools the Clause 4 schools shall be a reality and not a sham. Under the Bill as the Government sent it up from the House of Commons there was no security at all that the local authority would admit a Clause 4 school or allow it to come into the locality-no real security. The House of Lords have taken care that there shall be security. They have insisted that if the school, whatever the denomination to which it belongs, fulfils the conditions that school shall be taken over as a Clause 4 school. Is that a subject on which the Government are going to quarrel with the House of Lords? They themselves have told us over and over again that it is the duty of every education authority to take over and appropriate Clause 4 schools. Do they mean it to be done, and is it to be done? The House of Lords have only put into the Bill what the Government them- selves put into their speeches, but refused to put into the Bill. Is that to be subject of discussion? It is quite true that in addition to making the Clause 4 schools a reality the House of Lords have broken down the absolutely artificial barrier which the Government put up between the areas in which Clause 4 schools were to be permitted and the areas in which they were not to be permitted. As you know, when the Govern- ment sent the Bill up to the House of Lords these denominational schools were only allowed in urban areas--a wholly illogical distinction, and one that cannot be justified in argument—a distinction which was only put in originally and is now only maintained because the Government were more anxious to prevent the English Church from benefiting by Clause 4 schools than to give complete satisfaction to the Roman Catholics, who have a certain number of schools outside the urban area. If it is upon equal treatment between other denominations and the Church of England that the fight is to be engaged between the House of Commons and the House of Lords, it is a fight for which I am ready to go in and to fight and struggle to the last. IT IS A FIGHT IN WHICH WE SHALL HAVE ON OUR SIDE NOT MERELY THE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND, THE ATTACKED AND INJURED COMMUNITY, BUT EVERY MAN WHO LOVES FAIR PLAY, TO WHATEVER DENOMINATION HE BELONGS. THE POWERS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES. Now what is the argument brought by the Government against requiring Clause 4 and Clause 3 schools to be taken over by the local authority if they are otherwise proper to be taken over? They say you will be throwing too great a burden upon the education authority; the local authorities will always be protesting against this coercion, and we shall have to come in as arbiters and to deal with these cases as they arise. What a light does that throw upon the Government&apos;s intentions! They tell us in debate that of course all local authorities will take over all these schools-there are 14,000 of them-provided the buildings are fit and otherwise proper to be taken over. If that is true, whence this multitude of appeals and burdens that is going to be thrown upon the educational authority? If it is not true, if there are in the country local authorities who cannot be trusted to take over Clause 4 or Clause 3 schools, is Parliament going to lay down that in the interests of justice, and equity, and of religious tolerance and equality these schools ought to be taken over, but that, nevertheless, it is to be in the power of any local authority against the indicated wishes of Parliament to oppress the religious minority within their limits? It is a policy of mere cowardice to throw this responsibility on the local authority, and when we have Mr. Birrell and Mr. Asquith both telling us that as regards Clause 4 schools there is practical compulsion in the form in which the Bill went up from the House of Commons to the House of Lords, how can they quarrel with the House of Lords because that alleged compulsion is made real, efficient and undeniable ? I will only say one more word about this policy of leaving to &quot; &quot;480 NATIONAL DEBT.

The provisions for compensa- tion for disturbance, however, would lead to a system of fixing fair rents for town property, for which the time was not ripe. He also doubted the propriety of giving a right of compulsory purchase to town tenants.--Mr. Campbell (C.) described the Bill as a violation of existing contracts, and as confiscation of property.—Mr. J. Redmond said the two essential principles of the Bill had been approved by the Liberal party. Mr. Bryce supported the Bill, but opposed compensation for disturbance.- The 2nd R. was agreed to by 244 to 54, and referred to a Standing Committee. May 18. This Bill, having been adopted by the Govt. and passed through the Standing Committee, was considered on Report.-Mr. Balfour protested against such treatment of controversial unofficial Bills and insisted that Bills which the Govt. wished to pass should be prepared by the official draftsman. The 2nd R. had been secured on false pretences. Mr. Bryce said that in the Standing Committee the Govt. had secured the omission of the provision for leasehold enfranchisements, and amended the clause as to disturbance. They were, therefore, able to support the Bill.-Mr. Cherry (L.), Atty.- Genl. for Ireland, justified his action.-A motion for adjourning the debate was rejected by 278 to 75.-The Bill was then considered, and amendments were rejected, after closure. Mr. Campbell (C.) moved that the Bill should only affect tenancies entered into after its passing.-Mr. Bryce held that the Bill must be retrospective.—The closure was carried and the amendment rejected. Nov. 19. The Bill was further considered and amendments chiefly directed against the retro- spective character of the clause were discussed and rejected. Nov. 20. On Cl. 2, Mr. Campbell moved that there should be no compensation when the landlord had made a reasonable offer for the purchase of the interest of the outgoing tenant. Rejected by 336 to 77.-On Cl. 5 (compensation for disturbance), Mr. Campbell protested against giving to town tenants compensation for disturbance, which, he said, would involve fair rent Courts and fixity of tenure; a revolutionary change. He moved to omit the clause.-Mr. Bryce said the clause was designed to meet cases of capricious and vexatious eviction. Tenants in small country towns ought to have protection against despotic landlords.-Mr. Balfour said it would be monstrous to revolutionize the whole system of urban property in Ireland, because here and there a few owners could be found who were supposed to do wrong things.-The amendment was rejected by 308 to 74, and the Bill was ordered for 3rd R. The 3rd R. was carried by 201 to 28 after a short debate. Νου 21. Nov. 30. L-Lord Denman (L.) moved the 2nd R. of the Bill which, after a short debate, was agreed to. Dec. 6. In Committee, Lord Clonbrock (C.) moved to confine it to future improvements. -After debate, the amendment was carried by 123 to 29. Dec. 11. On Report, Lord Denman moved to amend Cl. 5 (compensation for unreasonable disturbance) by bringing the good will of the tenant within the clause.-Agreed to.—It was further agreed that compensation should not exceed three years&apos; rent.—The Report stage was concluded. Dec. 14. C-The Lords&apos; amendments were considered and Mr. Bryce indicated the course which the Govt. proposed to take. They would reject the amendments which took from the improvements clause of the measure its retrospective character and limited the amount of compensation payable for unreasonable disturbance to three years&apos; rent of the premises, and they would accept others dealing with compensation for disturbance. The necessary resolutions were carried by large majorities. Dec. 19. L-The Commons&apos; amendments were considered. It was agreed that the limit for a claim for compensation for improvements should be 10 years, and the proviso as to Cl. 5, that compensation for unreasonable disturbance should be limited to the amount of three years&apos; rent, was struck out, Dec. 20, and the Bill after vards became law. C-*Justices of the Peace Bill.-A Govt. Bill for the abolition of the property qualification for county magistrates having passed the 2nd R., was considered in Committee. Various amendments to limit it were considered and rejected. May 1. Cl. 4, giving the Ld. Chancellor power to remove ex officio justices was opposed by the Labour members and others. It was, however, carried by 355 to 82.-Mr. Brace (Lab.) moved that mayors and chairmen of local councils should be made permanent justices. Sir W. Robson (L.), Solr.-Genl., said this was outside the scope of the Bill -negatived.—Mr. Luttrell (L.) proposed a clause to make chairmen of boards of guardians and parish councils justices during their terms of office.-Negatived by 315 to 59.-The Bill passed through Committee, May 2, and afterwards became law.

The following pages contain a resumé of the Proceedings in Parliament from February 13th, 1906, to August 4th, 1906, and from October 23rd, 1906, to December 21st, 1906. The proceedings are collected under headings indicative of the subject-matters of discussion, with cross-references when necessary, so as to show the chronological course of each Bill or question throughout the Session. They are, as far as possible, arranged in alphabetical order, with the exception of debates &amp;quot;in Supply,&amp;quot; which generally appear in order of date under that heading, unless the subject is noticed elsewhere, when it is so stated. Matters relating exclusively to Scotland, Ireland, or Wales are inserted under the headings of the respective countries. The Summary deals only with such matters of public business as are of general importance or interest, and gives, as far as space permits, an outline of the leading speeches and arguments in both Houses, including the principal business dealt with in Standing Committees. Business in the House of Lords is prefixed by the letter L, and in the House of Commons by C. Government business is denoted by an asterisk. Opening of Parliament. The first Session of the second Parliament of His Majesty King Edward VII. was opened by Royal Commission, Feb. 13; the full State opening taking place on Feb. 19. C-Election of Speaker.-The Lord Chancellor delivered the Royal Message for the election of a Speaker.—Sir W. Lawson (L.) moved the election of the Rt. Hon. J. W. Lowther who was, he said, an old and tried servant of the House, and who possessed not only ability, courtesy and dignity, but a sense of proportion, a sense of humour, and common sense.-Mr. Stuart-Wortley (C.) seconded the motion, observing that the office of Speaker was becoming year by year increasingly arduous. Mr. Lowther, he said, had the dignity, courtesy, friendliness, promptitude, vigilance, foresight, knowledge, judicial spirit, impartiality, firmness, patience, humour, and an intuitive perception of the innate sense of the House. His election would promote its best interests. Mr. Lowther, in accordance with ancient practice, submitted himself to the will and judgment of the House. The motion being carried unanimously, Mr. Lowther was conducted to the Chair, and thanked the House for his election.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman congratulated him, and wished him &amp;quot;God speed&amp;quot; in his office. Mr. Akers-Douglas (C), for the Opposition, added his congratulations. Feb. 13. L-Mr. Lowther appeared at the bar and announced his election and his submission, with all humility, to the King&apos;s gracious approbation, which was conveyed by the Lord Chancellor. The Speaker then claimed for the Commons all their ancient rights and privileges, which were all conceded. He C-The Speaker reported that His Majesty had approved his election and had conceded all the ancient and undoubted rights and privileges of the Commons. again thanked the House for the great honour which it had conferred upon him. Feb. 14. L-King&apos;s Speech. His Majesty opened Parliament in person and read the Speech from the Throne, as follows:- 66 :- My Lords and Gentlemen, &amp;quot;The lamented death of the King of Denmark, to whom I was united by the closest ties of family and affection, has caused me much sorrow, and I feel convinced that the sympathy of the country will be extended to Queen Alexandra, who, in consequence of her severe bereavement, is prevented from accompanying me on the important occasion of the opening of the new Parliament. &amp;quot;The Prince and Princess of Wales left last autumn for India, and are visiting as many portions of my vast Empire as time will admit of. The reception they have met with from all classes has been most gratifying to me, and I trust that their visit will tend to strengthen, among my subjects in India, the feeling of loyalty to the Crown and attachment to this country. 66 &apos;It was with real satisfaction that I received the King of the Hellenes, who is so closely related to me, as my guest during the autumn. His Majesty&apos;s visit will, I am confident, confirm the friendly ties which have so long governed the relations existing between the two countries. 66 My relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly. &amp;quot;I rejoice that the war between Russia and Japan has been brought to an end by the satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations commenced last August, and due &quot; &quot;PARLIAMENTARY AND MUNICIPAL REGISTRATION. 263 COUNTIES-Continued. 20 Aug.-Claims of occupiers omitted from the list, and of new lodgers, to be sent to the Overseers by this date.

C-Education-PROVISION OF MEALS BILL-continued. In Committee of the whole House. Mr. H. Cox (L.) moved an amendment of which the object was to substitute the Poor Law guardians for the local education authorities in administering the Bill.--Mr. Lough (L.) said the Govt. desired that the feeding of children should not be viewed as poor relief.-Mr. Burns corroborated Dr. Macnamara&apos;s view that the order issued to the boards of guardians had been a failure. Arguing in favour of entrusting the education authorities with the duty of feeding the children, he laid stress on the importance of securing the cordial co-operation of school managers and teachers.-The amendment was negatived by 290 to 36. Dec. 6. Mr. Bowles (C.) moved to confine the operation of the Bill to underfed children.— Negatived by 230 to 39.-Cl. 1 was carried after closure, and a long discussion followed, in which the Bill was described by several members as unadulterated Socialism. The debate was continued till a late hour.-The Bill passed through Committee. Dec. 7. On Report, Sir F. Banbury (C.) moved to omit Cl. 1, which was supported by Sir W. Anson (L.U.).—On Cl. 2, Mr. Cave (C.) moved to prohibit the local authority from charging less than the estimated cost of the meal.-Rejected by 251 to 27.-After other amendments had been discussed and negatived, the Report stage was concluded, and the Bill was read a third time. Dec. 13. 66 66 C-*EDUCATION BILL.-Mr. Birrell (L.), Pres. Bd. of Education, introduced the Govt. Bill. The difficulty of the question, he said, was recognised by all, and it was greater now that the duties of the School Boards had been transferred to the already heavily-laden shoulders of the county and borough councils. The Bill provided that after 1st January, 1908, a school should not be recognised as a public elementary school unless it was provided&amp;quot; by the local education authority, so that no school would receive any public money from rates or taxes if it did not become a provided school.&amp;quot; Public money being paid to denominational schools, complete public control over them must be established. Every elementary school receiving Govt. grants and rates would become at once a provided school; and would supply the same religious instruction as now given in provided schools. No catechism or distinctive religious formulary would be taught, and the conscience clause would remain operative. That would be the general rule. The religious syllabuses in use by the School Boards and local authorities were the work of good and pious men of every creed, and it would be wise to continue them, as they were approved by the vast majority of the Protestant population. The alternative was denominational education all round and multiplication of schools, which was impossible. Complete public control entailed the appointment of the teachers by the local authority and the abolition of religious tests. One-half of the children were now in non-provided schools, some good, some moderately good, and others bad or very bad. The second clause authorized a local authority, when continuing any voluntary school as a provided school, to make, with the consent of the Board of Education, arrangements with the owners of the schoolhouse by which the former would assume the whole responsibility of maintaining the fabric. The cost of this change was estimated at about £260,000 a year. The owners would retain the use of them in the evenings and on Saturdays and Sundays; and the Bill provided that special denominational teaching might be given in these schools, to children whose parents desired it, on two mornings in the week. The expense involved would be paid by the owners, and there would be no compulsory attendance except for secular instruction. Denominational teaching would not be given by the regular teachers. urban places the local authority might grant extended opportunities for de- nominational teaching in transferred voluntary schools, after holding a public inquiry, and if the parents of three-fourths of the children attending wished such instruction to be given. Minorities might trust to the generosity and fairness of the local authori- ties in such cases. If any non-provided school did not come to terms with the local authority it could either be kept open without public assistance or could be closed. But schools held in trust for educational purposes under the law affecting charities would either be kept open or be appropriated to such uses as the law might decide. A commission of three persons would be appointed to settle schemes for such schools. The Bill would exempt teachers from the duty of giving religious instruction. As to finance, it was proposed that, in addition to existing grants, a further annual grant of £1,000,000 would be given to be distributed in aid of the local education rate. Part II. of the Bill dealt with educational endowments, so as to make them serviceable for the advancement of education and the improvement of administrative machinery. There was also a special provision for a central council for Wales.-Sir W. Anson (L.U.) said the Bill was designed for the purpose of abolishing 14,000 voluntary schools, which In &quot; &quot;348 VOTES IN DIVISIONS-SESSIONS 1906. MEMBERS. BELLAIRS, C.. BELLOC, HILAIRE J.

C-Africa, South-TRANSVAAL AND ORANGE RIVER COLONY-continued. but might cause greater disturbance. It was admitted that there had been illega punishments, including flogging. A Commission could not do away with uncertainty as to the future of the mining industry. Chinese labour itself was uncertain, and might be stopped at the caprice of the Chinese Govt. The Govt. were fully conscious of the anxiety felt in Africa. When responsible government was established no power of restraint would be exercised over the Colony, except such as had frequently been exercised elsewhere, e.g., in Newfound- land. H.M. Govt. had no intention of exceeding their powers, and would make every effort to promote the welfare of the mining industry and to prevert collision with the Colonial Legislature.-Mr. A. Balfour insisted that the Transvaal, when a self- governing Colony, should decide what was moral and what was not. An inquiry would show whether the mining industry could be carried on except by unskilled labour at lower wages than Englishmen would accept. The Govt. proposed to allow the Transvaal to make its own plan, and then to quarrel with them if it was not acceptable. The question was as to the conditions on which the mining industry could flourish, paying expenses and a reasonable profit. Expert opinion would be most valuable and the refusal to obtain it was a great misuse of an overwhelming majority. Sir H. C.-Bannerman said there was an abundance of abuse in the Blue- books. But whether the labour conditions were contrary to the traditions, wishes, and ideals of the British people, could not be decided by a Commission. The British Govt. was responsible for them, and he maintained that they partook of the nature of slavery, in the popular sense. If the Chinese were to be admitted as free labourers we were not entitled to interfere. But if otherwise, the Govt. had such a right. He referred to the coolies as living in enforced celibacy, and said that the state of things resulting from this was perfectly appalling. If the real state of affairs were realised, it would be made short work of. We were bound to see that natives and Chinese were treated with justice. -The amendment was rejected by 378 to 110. Mar. 21 Mr. W. Byles (Lab.) moved a resolution disapproving approval of the conduct of Lord Milner, as High Commissioner of S. Africa and Governor of the Transvaal, in authorizing the flogging of Chinese labourers in breach of the law, in violation of treaty obligations, and without the knowledge or sanction of the Secy. of State for the Colonies. Mr. Chamberlain described the resolution as an ungenerous persecution of a great public servant, with a splendid record, for a single error of judgment. Its supporters dared not challenge Lord Milner&apos;s policy as a whole, but they fastened on one little point in a great man&apos;s life. The amendment to be proposed by Mr. Churchill was a weak and cowardly amendment, framed with the object of catching votes. Great services to the State were not cancelled by one mistake, and he appealed to the House to do nothing which might discourage our representatives in distant parts of the globe. Mr. Churchill moved an amendment condemning the flogging of Chinese coolies, but inviting the House in the interests of peace and conciliation in S. Africa, to refrain from censuring individuals. He said it could not be disputed that Lord Milner had been guilty of a grave dereliction of public duty. But he questioned the practical utility of a formal censure, as it was contrary to usage to condemn a man unheard, and it was not known how far he was cognisant of the extent of the flogging. Lord Milner had served the country for 20 years strenuously, faithfully, and disinterestedly. The motion would aggravate social and racial animosity in S. Africa.-Mr. Balfour described the protection accorded to Lord Milner by the Govt. as insulting. He vindicated Lord Milner&apos;s great career, and argued strongly that judgment should not be passed on one single incident.—The resolution was negatived, and the amendment was carried by 355 to 135. Mar. 21. Sir H. C.-Bannerman announced that a Committee was to go to S. Africa to advise the Government on the subject of the new Constitution for the Transvaal and Orange River Colonies. The members were-Sir West Ridgeway (chairman), Lord Sandhurst, Sir F. Hopwood, and Col. Johnston. Mar. 22. L-Lord Lovat (L.Ü.) asked what were the intentions of the Govt. in regard to land settlement in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony.-Lord Elgin said the question of land settlement must largely depend on the settlers themselves, and he could not state the intentions of the Govt. until they had obtained further information.-Lord Milner (L.U.) praised the efforts of those who had helped to improve the agricultural industry. If the new settlers did not receive sympathetic treatment their position would be unsafe. They believed that under responsible government they would not receive the slightest consideration. The land laws should be kept under Imperial control. Mar. 27. Lord Halifax (L.U.) moved a resolution recording &amp;quot;high appreciation of the services rendered by Lord Milner in South Africa to the Crown and the Empire.&amp;quot; He &quot; &quot;CONSTITUENCIES AND ELECTIONS. 163 ENGLAND-COUNTIES-continued: Durham County-continued.

If these sums, and the payments made from them, had been included, the amounts in cols. 1, 2, 4, and 5, for the years referred to, would each have been considerably larger than stated, and the proportions per head of the population would, of course, have been somewhat increased.

(g) Including £3,200,000 for Alabama Claims. (h) Including £200,000 for Localisation of Military Forces, and £76,565 for charges connected with the purchase of the Suez Canal Shares, not covered by money raised. (k) Including Extraordinary Expenditure on account of Russo-Turkish War. (1) Including Extraordinary Expenditure on account of War in South Africa. (m) Exclusive of the proportion of the Death Duties, and of the proceeds of certain Licence duties, and since 1890-91 of the portion of the Beer and Spirit duties, assigned to the relief of Local Taxation. (n) This includes £2,009,958 on account of the Debt Conversion operations, which, though not pro- vided for in the Budget Estimates, was met out of Revenue. But for this special expenditure the surplus in the last column would have been £2,798,940. &quot; &quot;THE CONSTITUTIONAL YEAR BOOK, 1907. COMMON NOTES FOR 1907. Golden Number Epact Solar Cycle ..

POWERS AND FUNCTION OF THE SOVEREIGN. The durability, the regularity, and the popularity of the English Monarchy are curiously illustrated by the statement made by more than one writer on the Con- stitution, that from Egbert (802 A.D.) to Edward VII., the blood of Cerdic, the first King of Wessex (519 A.D.), has run in the veins of every English Sovereign, with the exception of Sweyn, Canute, Harold, and William the Conqueror. (See p. 18.) In Saxon times the Crown was essenti- ally dependent upon the popular will. It was not strictly hereditary. Preference would be given cæteris paribus to the son of a deceased king, but the chief object was to obtain a leader capable of main- taining the defence and the order of the realm. It was held that the Witenagemot, or national council, had power to depose an unworthy sovereign, and to revoke grants of public land unwisely made by him. The privileges and the powers of the King were nevertheless consider- able. He was entitled to maintenance for himself and his retinue on public journeys, and to the produce of wrecks, tolls, mines, fines, and forfeitures. He was the leader of the national forces. He was the foun- tain of justice, a court of appeal in the last resort, with arbitrary powers both of mercy and of punishment. The grounds upon which William and Harold respec- tively laid claim to the Crown of Saxon England illustrate the position of the Monarchy. Harold urged that his oath of allegiance to William had been extorted by force, that he could not promise a Crown that was not his, that he had been elected by the free will of the people. William relied on the oath of Harold, who had sworn fealty upon the sacred relics, and on the choice of Edward the Con- fessor. After the Norman Conquest, the power of the Crown was greatly augmented. This arose from the stern character of William, from his authority as a military conqueror, and from the change in the tenure of land. At Salisbury, in 1085, William received the fealty of all land- holders, both of those who held in chief and of their tenants. All held from the Crown. One of the peculiar attributes of the feudal compact was thus infringed and altered. The Crown became despotic for 130 years, and its exactions were tremen- dous. At last, in 1215, Magna Charta laid the foundations of English liberty. appears that this great Statute was con- firmed no less than thirty-two times, for whenever money was required by the King its renewal was demanded. It now stands on the Statute Book as 25 Edward I. (1297). Section 29 of this Act is the key- It stone of English History. &amp;quot;No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be dis- seised of his freehold or liberties or free customs, or be outlawed or exiled, or any otherwise destroyed; nor will we pass upon him nor condemn him but by lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either justice or right.&amp;quot; Personal freedom, security of property, and liberty of movement, thus became the essential rights of every Englishman. The Crown was not strictly hereditary until the time of Edward II. It was de- clared to be hereditary by a Statute in the 25th year of Edward III. From the time of the confirmation of the Great Charter (1297) to the accession of the House of Tudor (1485), the preroga- tive of the Crown was often exercised in an arbitrary manner, though there was a constant assertion of privilege on the part of the Commons. Parliament met irregu- larly, at the King&apos;s pleasure. The right of purveyance, the sale of pardons, the fines demanded on the accession or mar- riage of an heir, gave occasion for exac- tions that were heavy and uncertain. Windsor Castle was built in the reign of Edward III., under the right of purvey- ance, by which writs were issued to sheriffs of counties to furnish such workmen as might be required. the Under the House of Tudor, 1485-1603, the Crown had great power. The country was weary of civil war, and dreaded above all things a disputed succession; nobles were exhausted, and had lost much of their power, and the Commons had not learned to use their strength. Henry VII., by means of the Star Chamber, treated with great rigour the nobles, the members of Parliament, and the jurors who offended him. Henry VIII. was almost absolute, and his proclamations had the force of law. The reign of Edward VI. was marked by a milder rule, and by a repeal of the Statute giving to the King&apos;s proclamation the force of law. Elizabeth, strong, despotic, and self- willed, yet had the wisdom so essential to a great ruler. She knew when and how to yield, without loss of dignity or of power. She was the first Sovereign under whom the constitutional right of Parliament to grant supplies was recognised; and the loans that were raised were punctually repaid. The Stuarts were a very different race (1603-1688). Through good and through ill fortune they clung to the idea of the absolute power and privilege of the throne. &quot; &apos;HOUSE OF COMMONS. 155 ANALYSIS. LANDED INTEREST- Landowners ..........

NONCONFORMISTS IN PARLIAMENT. At a Liberation Society Breakfast on February 27th, 1906, the Chairman said that the number of Nonconformists in the new Parliament was as follows:- Congregationalists..

Also, if a clause be then under consideration, a motion may be made (the assent of the Chair as aforesaid not having been withheld) that the question, that certain words of the clause defined in the motion stand part of the clause, or that the clause stand part of, or be added to, the Bill, be now put. Such motions shall be put forthwith, and decided with- out amendment or debate. &amp;quot;Provided always, that this rule shall be put in force only when the Speaker or the Chairman of Ways and Means is in the chair.&amp;quot; Questions for the closure of debate under this order are decided in the affirmative if, when a division be taken, it appears by the numbers declared from the Chair that not less than 100 members voted in the majority in support of the motion. Rules of Debate. Every member desiring to speak must rise in his place uncovered, and address himself to the Speaker. A member may not read a speech, but may refresh his memory by notes. Members can only speak to a point of order, while the House is dividing, by permission of the Speaker, and, while speaking, are to sit covered. A new member who has not yet spoken, is generally called upon, by courtesy, in preference to other members. On resum- ing an adjourned debate, the member who moved its adjournment is allowed prece- dence by courtesy. The Speaker or Chairman may call the attention of the House, or Committee, to continued irrele- vance or tedious repetition of his own arguments, or the arguments of others, on the part of a member; and may direct the member to discontinue his speech. In questions to ministers or other members, no argument or opinion may be offered, nor any facts stated, except so far as necessary to explain the question. By indulgence, a member may explain matters of a personal nature, although there be no question before the House; but they may not be debated. · A reply is allowed to a member who has made a substantive motion to the House. Any member may rise to speak &amp;quot;to order,&amp;quot; or upon a matter of privilege suddenly arising. No member is to allude to any debate of the same session, on any question not then under discussion. A member may not allude to any debate in the other House of Parliament. He may not use His Majesty&apos;s name irreverently in debate, nor for the purpose of influencing the House in its deliberations; nor may he refer to any other member by name. In case of grave disorder, the Speaker may adjourn the House, or suspend the sitting for a fixed time. Censure. Whenever any member is named by the Speaker or Chairman, im- mediately after an offence of disregarding the authority of the Chair, or of abusing the rules of the House by persistently and wilfully obstructing the business of the House, or otherwise, has been com- mitted by such member, a question is forthwith put, without amendment, ad- journment, or debate, &amp;quot;That such member be suspended from the service of the House.&apos; If any member is so suspended, the Order continues in force until the end of the Session, unless pre- viously rescinded. The suspension does not exempt the member from serving on any private bill committee. Not more than one member can be &amp;quot;named&amp;quot; at the same time, unless several have jointly disregarded the authority of the Chair. A member whose conduct is grossly dis- orderly may be ordered to withdraw from the House for the remainder of the day&apos;s sitting, or he may be &amp;quot;named &amp;quot; as above described. On March 7, 1901, in conse- quence of the action of certain Irish members, the following amended Stand- ing Order was passed:- &amp;quot;That if any member or members acting jointly, who have been suspended under this Order from the service of the House, shall re- fuse to obey the direction of the Speaker, when severally summoned under the Speaker&apos;s orders by the Serjeant-at- Arms to obey such direction, the Speaker shall call the attention of the House to the fact that recourse to force is neces-ary in order to compel obedience to his direc- tion, and the member or members named by him as having refused to obey his direction shall thereupon, and without further question put, be suspended from the service of the House, during the re- mainder of the Session.&amp;quot; (The regula- tions governing the question of order in debate were under consideration in the Session of 1992, but the discussion was suspended, and has not since been resumed.) Divisions.-No member may vote unless present when the question is put, and every member so present must voté. 10 &quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;PROGRESS OF IRELAND. 501 Progress of Ireland.-Summarised Statistics respecting the Progress of Ireland during the period from 1889 to 1905. 47.

Have they got to put their hands in their pockets, have they got to find the money by which the religious teaching of their children is conferred? It is conferred at your expense, at the expense of the ratepayer, whatever his religious creed, and every parent of every child throughout the country, Noncon- formist or Churchman, who desires only Cowper-Temple religious teaching for his children, can get that teaching, not at the cost of his own pocket, but at the cost of the general taxpayer. If we are to talk of endowment in this connection at all, if anything is endowed it is that form of religious teaching which has been openly accepted by the great Nonconformist bodies in this country, against which I have not a word to say, but which seems to me, as far as I can judge the matter, to be no more worthy of public endowment out of moneys drawn from the pockets of the people of every kind of religious belief than any other form of religious conviction. And yet these Ministers have the face to come forward and tell us that in a Bill where every shilling given to Cowper-Temple teaching is public money-that that is an endowment of denominational religion. A more hypocritical pretence was never brought forward by responsible Ministers. MR. BIRRELL&apos;S ACADEMIC PROFESSIONS PUT INTO FORCE. I have told you, and I think I have proved, that WHAT THE HOUSE OF LORDS HAVE DONE, OR ARE IN PROCESS OF DOING, IS TO MAKE THE BILL IN FACT AND IN TRUTH WHAT THE PROFESSIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT, IN IRRESPONSIBLE SPEECHES TO DEPUTATIONS AND ELSEWHERE, HAVE SAID IT SHOULD BE, AND TO CARRY TO THEIR LOGICAL CONCLUSIONS THE PRINCIPLES WHICH THE GOVERNMENT THEMSELVES HAVE ADMITTED. There is one other matter on which I hope the House of Lords will carry out the same procedure. I was an admiring listener to the last speech which the Minister for Education delivered on the Bill before it left the House of Commons. It was an eloquent and obviously sincere appeal in favour of religious education in the primary schools of the country. What is the use of telling us in impassioned language that religion is the great and vital necessity in the teaching of the young when you are recommending a Bill which in the first place turns 14,000 schools, which at present require religion as part of their training, into schools from which every local authority might withdraw all religious teaching by a stroke of the pen? WHAT IS THE USE OF ALL YOUR ELO- • · QUENCE ABOUT RELIGIOUS EDUCATION WHEN YOU TAKE RELIGIOUS EDUCATION WHICH IS NOW GIVEN WITHIN SCHOOL HOURS AND PUT IT OUTSIDE SCHOOL HOURS? WHAT IS THE USE OF TALKING ABOUT RELIGIOUS EDUCATION WHEN YOU REFUSE TO THOSE MOST QUALIFIED TO GIVE IT THE VERY ELEMENTARY RIGHT TO GIVE IT ? WHAT THE LORDS HAVE DONE FOR RELIGIOUS TEACHING. The House of Lords are transferring from the peroration of the Minister for Education to the Bill of the Minister for Education all those fine sentiments. They are making his genuine but academic professions a legislative reality. They are giving rights which may preserve in those schools religious education. They are putting that religious education within the regular time-table of the schools, so that RELIGIOUS EDUCATION SHALL NOT FIGURE AS A MERE EXTRA, LIKE DANCING OR DEPORTMENT, BUT BE PART OF THE ESSENTIAL TEACHING OF EVERY CHILD WHOSE PARENT DOES NOT OBJECT. They are preserving to the teachers in the schools the right to continue the teaching which they have given with such admirable effect in the past. Who are the real friends of religious education in this country-the Ministry who are making these speeches and bringing in these Bills, or the House of Lords, which turns these Bills into something which resembles the speeches? I cannot believe that if we are to have a great constitutional conflict upon this subject the country will not declare itself in an unmistakable manner against the clauses brought in by the Minister for Education and in favour of the speeches delivered by the Minister for Education; and it is to these speeches I would turn when I ask my countrymon to accept this set of amendments which the House of Lords have most rightly introduced into the Government proposal.

The following list contains particulars of ten important divisions which took place during the Sessions of 1906. In order to ascertain how any particular member voted in any of these divisions, reference should first be made to the number it bears in the consecutive list printed below, and then under the heading indicating the number of the division will be found the letter A or N, showing that the member in question voted with the &amp;quot;Ayes&amp;quot; or with the &amp;quot; Noes. The last column contains the number of divisions attended by each member during the Sessions of 1906. It will be understood that this is not a record of the number of sittings each member has attended, but only of his attendance at divisions. The total number of divisions during the Sessions of 1906 was 501; 318 of these were taken in the Spring Session, and 183 in the Autumn Session. Particulars of the principal divisions which took place between the years 1880 and 1905 will be found in the previous issues of the Constitutional Year Book, No. 1. PAYMENT OF MEMBERS. March 7th, 1906.

H. Lever). 99 &amp;quot;&amp;quot; Amendment proposed and rejected, to leave out from the word &amp;quot;that, to the end of the question, and add the words &amp;quot;it is not competent or desirable for this House of its own Motion, and being the custodian and protector of the public purse, and acting therein in a fiduciary capacity to the taxpayers of this country, to vote for and to pay or appropriate to its own members out of that purse any money for their own personal use and benefit (Sir Henry Kimber). Main Question then put, the House divided: Ayes 348; Noes 110. No. 2. VOTE OF CENSURE ON LORD MILNER. March 21st, 1906. Motion made and Question proposed- &amp;quot;That this House expresses its dis- approval of the conduct of Lord Milner, as High Commissioner of South Africa and Governor of the Transvaal, in authorising the flogging of Chinese labourers in breach of the law, in violation of treaty obligations, and without the knowledge or sanction of His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for the Colonies&amp;quot; (Mr. W. P. Byles). Amendment proposed, to leave out from the word &amp;quot;House&amp;quot; to the end of the question, and insert the words, &amp;quot;while recording its condemnation of the flogging of Chinese coolies in breach of the law, desires in the interests of peace and con- ciliation in South Africa to refrain from passing censure upon individuals&amp;quot; (Mr. W. S. Churchill). Question &amp;quot;That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Question,&amp;quot; put and negatived. Question put-&amp;quot;That those words be there inserted.&amp;quot; The House divided: Aycs 355; Noes 135. No. 3. SALARY OF THE LORD PRESIDENT. April 26th, 1906.

The Instruments providing for the grant of a similar Constitution to the Orange River Colony are in preparation. &amp;quot;I trust that during the coming year the new form of Government will come into full operation, and will exert a powerful influence not only in securing the peace and prosperity of both Colonies, but in contributing to the unity and strength of my possessions in South Africa. &amp;quot;Gentlemen of the House of Commons, &amp;quot;I thank you for the liberality with which you have made provision for the Services for the year. 66 66 My Lords and Gentlemen, A measure for further extending and facilitating the provision of cottages and allotments of land by the Rural District Councils of Ireland for the use of labourers, and for conferring other benefits on this deserving class of my subjects, has passed into law. I am happy to say that the country continues tranquil, and that the general improvement in the state of the peasantry makes the failure of the potato crop, which has in some districts been serious, a less grave misfortune than it would have been in former times. 66 A Bill relating to the Tenancy of certain classes of houses in Ireland, which has also been passed, will place the Law on a more equitable footing and remove a long. standing sense of grievance. 66 &apos;Important measures have received my sanction for the amendment of the existing Merchant Shipping Laws, having in view alike the well being of the seamen and the interests of the shipowners, and for taking a periodical census of the industrial pro- duction of the country. 66 A measure has been passed amending the Law in regard to Trade Disputes, which will, I hope, remove all legitimate cause of grievance, and I have also given my assent to an Act to amend and consolidate the Law of Workmen&apos;s Compensation, extending the benefits of the Law to over six million persons not included under the provisions of preceding Acts. 66 I have assented to an Act for the amendment of the Law relating to Agricultural Holdings and to other measures affecting agriculture. I trust that the close attention which has been given to these questions will be of material benefit to that important industry. &quot; &quot;210 CONSTITUENCIES AND ELECTIONS. Glasgow City-continued.

Hay (C.) moved an amend- ment complaining that no remedy had been proposed for want of employment.-Mr. Burns (Lab.), Pres. Local Govt. Bd., said the only want of employment was in the build- ing trade, and was owing to the war. He looked for beneficial results from the action of several Commissions and Committees then sitting.-Amendment negatived. Feb. 26. On the motion for the Whitsuntide adjournment, the question of the unemployed was raised by the Labour members, who complained that the Govt. had not made adequate efforts to deal with the problem.-Mr. K. Hardie asked for a million for experimental schemes by local authorities. Mr. Burns said that much of the unemployment was due to the fact that 95 per cent. of the men were unskilled, and 90 per cent. of them were town born and bred, and were, therefore, displaced by stronger men from the country. The best remedy would be to keep the people on the land, but the present land system could not be put an end to by John Burns in a year. Apprenticeship might do much, and the Salvation Army colonies were successful. Unskilled labourers, he hoped, would learn to make provision for dark days, and not to waste their earnings in unworthy ways. The Govt. would amend the Unemployed Workmen&apos;s Act, but preventives were better than palliatives, and they should wait and judge the Govt. by their record after six years. May 30. *In Supply, Mr. Burns (L.), Pres. Local Govt. Bd., made a statement on the Unemployed Workmen&apos;s Act, and explained what the Govt. proposed doing in the autumn and winter. The Act had given aid to a large number of casual or unskilled workmen, but the labour bureaux which had been set up had been only partially successful. Valuable experience had, however, been gained. As to the future, it would be impossible to solve the problem of the unemployed in one Session, but the Govt. had decided to make a grant out of the Consolidated Fund, not exceeding £200,000, to be distributed by him among distress committees according to their needs. Out of this grant, and rates and voluntary contributions £300,000 or £400,000 would be available for the winter. For the final solution of the problem they relied on legislation ameliorating the social condition of the poor, on the principle of the Irish Labourers Bill, and the extension of small holdings and allotments. In the East of London casual dock labour was a difficulty which he would try to mitigate. The present proposals were interim proposals, pending the social measures of reform which would be brought in during the next few years.-Mr. Long (C.) said the measures to be taken would not solve the unemployed problem. - July 19. *WORKMEN&apos;S COMPENSATION BILL. Mr. H. Gladstone (L.), Home Secy., introduced a Bill to provide further compensation to workmen for injury. The Act of 1897, he said, excluded all workmen who were not expressly mentioned, but the Bill would include all who were not expressly excluded. The expression&amp;quot; workman &amp;quot; would exclude police constables, clerks, outworkers, domestic servants, or members of an employer&apos;s family living with him. Small employers (who were practically workmen) would also be excluded, when the number of his workmen did not exceed five, except in certain specified cases. The Bill could not be final, and probably the whole question would be solved by a scheme of compulsory insurance. It was also proposed to extend the Act of 1897 to persons contracting industrial diseases, enu- merated in a schedule. The minimum period of disablement before compensation could be claimed would be reduced to one week. Various other provisions were made for assessing the compensation payable on death or injury, also special provision for minors, widows and dependants, and for the appointment of medical referees.—Mr. Akers-Douglas (C.) said there was no difference of opinion as to the desirability of amending the Act of 1897, but the Bill would require very careful consideration. The proposal to reduce the period before compensation could fall due would throw a very heavy burden on employers.-Mr. Barnes (Lab.) advocated the introduction of some form of compulsory insurance, and compensation after three days&apos; disablement.— Sir W. S. Robson (L.), Solr.-Genl., said the limit of five workmen would only apply to trades in which risks were small.—Mr. Chamberlain disapproved of this limit, and also the exclusion of clerks and domestic servants.-Read a first time. March 6. On the 2nd R., Sir C. Dilke (L.) moved an amendment in favour of compulsory insurance, relying largely on foreign precedents.-Mr. Gladstone described the diffi- culties in the way of the establishment of such a plan without considerable previous inquiry. The principle was right, and it ought to be carried into effect when possible. -The amendment was negatived. The debate was ultimately adjourned. April 4. After a general discussion, Mr. H. Samuel (L.), Under-Secy., replied to criticisms on the Bill. He advised shipowners to protect themselves by insurance. All occupations could not be brought within the compensation law without inflicting hardship on small and poor employers. No foreign country extended compensation to domestic &quot; &quot;180 CONSTITUENCIES AND ELECTIONS. ENGLAND-LONDON BOROUGHS-continued. Croydon-continued. *1895. May 24.

All criminal prosecutions are conducted in his name, and he can, with a few exceptions, pardon all offenders, either before or after conviction; though this prerogative is in practice seldom exercised. He is the head of society in the kingdom. All degrees of nobility are or have been derived by grant from the Crown. All titles of honour are in the gift of the Crown, and all corporations owe their charters, either directly or indirectly, to the same source. The Sovereign alone can coin money, impress what stamp he chooses upon it, and impart to it its legally current value. The Sovereign, being &amp;quot;Supreme governor as well in all spiritual or ecclesiastical things or causes temporal,&amp;quot; appoints all archbishops and bishops of the Established Church. In respect of external affairs, the Sovereign appoints all ambassadors and diplomatic agents to foreign governments, receives foreign potentates and ambassadors, and conducts all negotiations with those States; appoints Commissions of enquiry; concludes treaties, and makes war or peace; has the supreme command of the army and navy, and appoints all the officers of those services; appoints the viceroys of Ireland and India, and the governors of Colonies and foreign pos- sessions. In the case of certain of the Colonies he prescribes the form of govern- ment, and in all of them his assent is essential to the validity of all acts of colonial legislation. But the old times of arbitrary power and the irresponsible use of it have passed away. The tyranny of Norman, Plantagenet, Tudor and Stuart Kings has disappeared. The power of the great nobles is only a subject for romance. The power of the Commons remains strong, rigorous, and restless: yet there is a sentiment that has controlled, and ought still to control, the dominant ele- ment in the State-an unswerving regard for British freedom and British law, the security of property, and the safety of the person. THE CIVIL LIST AND The Civil List of King Edward VII. is exceeded in amount by the revenue of several foreign monarchs. The income of some of the foreign sovereigns is stated to be as follows:-Russia, unknown, but generally believed to be upwards of £2,000,000; Austria-Hungary, £780,000; Prussia, £770,000; Italy, £614,000; Spain, £380,000. The King&apos;s Civil List is also considerably less than that of previous British sovereigns. The Civil List of George II. was £800,000; that of George III. in 1815, amounted to £1,030,000; and William IV. received £510,000. In his speech from the Throne on February 14th, 1901, His Majesty stated that he placed the Hereditary revenues of the Crown, as his predecessor had done, unreservedly at the disposal of the House of Commons. The Civil List Act, 1901 (1 Edw. VII., cap. 4), was passed in recognition of the fact that these revenues belonged to the Crown. It is directed, therefore, that the Hereditary Revenue specified in the Civil List Act of 1837 (which were then declared to be due and payable to Her Majesty Queen Victoria) shall be carried to the credit of the Consolidated Fund, and that the clear yearly sum of £470,000 shall be paid out of the same as a provision for the honour and dignity of the Crown. ROYAL GRANTS. The manner in which the Royal income is to be applied is strictly defined, as follows:- Their Majesties&apos; Privy Purse* £110,000 Salaries of H.M. Household and Retired Allowances 125,800 Expenses of H.M. Household 193,000 Works. Royal Bounty, Alms, and Special Services Unappropriated Mon ys ...... 20,000 13,200 8,000 £470,000 His Majesty also enjoys the revenues arising from the Duchy of Lancaster estates, amounting in 1904 to £63,000. The above arrangement lasts during the present reign and for six months after- wards. It is not unfavourable to the nation, since the Crown estates have pro- duced an annual rental almost equal to, and sometimes greater, than the amount of the Civil List. The net income of the Crown Lands in 1904-5 was £470,000, and the smaller branches of the Hereditary revenue pro- duced £29,400. TAXES ON THE ROYAL INCOME. Income Tax is paid upon His Majesty&apos;s private estates, upon the Civil List for Their Majesties&apos; Privy Purse, upon the sum allotted to the expenses of the Household, and upon unexpended and * The amount assigned by His Majesty to the Queen was stated in Parliament (10 June, 1901) to be £33,000. &quot; &apos;374 PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS, 1906.

Your labours upon these and upon all other matters I humbly commend to the blessing of Almighty God.&amp;quot; Feb. 19 L-Address. The Marquis of Northampton (L.) moved, and Lord Herschell (L.) seconded, the Address in reply to His Majesty&apos;s Speech. The Marquis of Lansdowne (L.U.) referred to the question of Morocco and said he hoped for a durable settlement. On the subject of Chinese labour in the Transvaal the late Govt. considered it as an experiment involving a certain risk, but they denied having introduced a system of slavery, and protested against the charge. A full inquiry ought to be made before the system was stopped. He wished to know whether in the Transvaal power was to be transferred from the British to the Boers. He hoped the suspension of the Crimes Act in Ireland was due to the feeling that it could be done vih safety. As to general legislation, the House of Lords would not oppose it if it were prudent and moderate. They had never thwarted the will of the people when deliberately expressed, but there would be much useful criticism.-The Marquis of Ripon (L.) replied. He said the Govt. would continue to support France in the Moroccan settlement, with a view to maintaining order, civilization, and the open door for trade. As to Chinese labour, many things were done at the election which had better not have been done. The Govt. held strong views on the question. It was semi-slavery. They had stopped the further importation of Chinese, so that the question might be decided by the Transvaal people. Both the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal would have responsible government, and steps would be first taken to obtain full information. In Ireland the Govt. relied on the ordinary law. As to education, a great change was necessary and urgent. On the question of free trade the Govt. were determined not to allow it to be weakened.-The Address was agreed to.. Feb. 19. G―The Address, in reply to the King&apos;s Speech, was moved by Mr. Dickinson (L.) and seconded by Mr. Acland (L.).—Mr. J. Chamberlain (L.U.), acting as Mr. Balfour&apos;s substitute at his request, congratulated the mover and seconder on their task. Referring to the result of the general election, he said there had been overpowering majorities before and no special disasters had ensued. Defeated parties had always recovered from their difficulties, and he was glad there was a strong Govt. whose responsibility was proportionate to their power, and who would meet with no merely factious opposi- tion at the hands of the Unionists. He was glad there would be continuity in foreign policy, and asked for information as to the Morocco conference at Algeciras. Time alone could show whether it was wise to confer responsible government on the Transvaal and Orange River Colony at once. He asked for information as to the electoral system, and as to what was to be done with reference to Chinese labour. During the election the coolies had been described as in a state of slavery, and even sometimes undergoing horrible tortures. If the Govt. believed that the cartoons so issued represented the truth, how could they justify their inaction? A Royal Commission should be appointed to inquire, as the honour of the country was concerned. He welcomed the evidence of the improvement in trade, but asked how it was that one-third of the population was still underfed and on the verge of starvation, as the Prime Minister had said was the case. As to Ireland, he warned the Govt. that any policy leading to Home Rule would be opposed with unrelenting hostility. He asked why the Crimes Act was to be discontinued, and why the generous treatment now accorded to evicted tenants was not to be extended to the British farmer who paid his rent. Referring to tariff reform, he said that the reformers would not be discouraged, any more than Cobden was discouraged, by a failure at the outset.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman (L.), Prime Minister, after a reference to foreign relations and the understanding with France, said that in colonial affairs he favoured continuity of policy in so far as that there should be no wanton change for the sake of change. The Govt. had determined to grant responsible Legislatures to the new African colonies, being largely influenced by local opinion, and experience in other colonies. There would be an inquiry into the question of representation. They looked forward to the eventual federation of S. Africa. As to Chinese labour, the conditions imposed were servile conditions, some being either cruel or leading to cruelty. The question would be left to the responsible Govt. of &quot; &quot;HOUSE OF COMMONS. 153 Williams, A. Osmond (Merioneth- shire); b. 1849; Landowner; el. 1900.- 79a, Pall Mall, S. W. L.

(E) EMPLOYMENT. In addition to the above restriction on the maximum expenditure, regulations are imposed upon the candidate in respect to the number of persons who may be employed, for payment, in the work of an election, and the number of committee rooms which may be engaged. They are as under :- Boroughs.-In boroughs, in addition to one election agent (through whose hands all expenditure must pass), and a polling agent in each station, a number of clerks and messengers is allowed in the propor- tion of one for every 500 electors. Paid agents, clerks, &amp;amp;c., if employed in any division of a divided borough, are pre- hibited from voting in that or any other division of the same borough, and each must be so informed by the election agent. Counties-In counties, there is allowed in addition to one election agent, a sub- (F) RETURN With a view to ensure the due obser- vance of these provisions, the Act requires a detailed return of the amount expended under each head to be made by the election agent, and signed and attested before a Justice of the Peace. The candidate is also bound to make a similar declaration agent for each polling district, together with one clerk and one messenger for every such district, or for every 500 electors in large districts. A caudidate is also allowed a staff of clerks and me-sengers at central committee room of the county, at the rate of one for every 5.000 electors. Committee Rooms.-The engagement of committee rooms is authorised to the extent of one for each polling district (or for every 500 electors) in a county, and one for every 500 electors in a borough. Several restrictions are placed upon the choice of these committee rooms. They must not be held in either a licensed house or a refreshment house, or upon the pre- mises of any elementary school in receipt of a parliamentary grant. But they may be held without objection in the rooms of auy permanent political club.

(c) The vacancies caused on the said Council as aforesaid, and the vacancy caused by the abolition of the office of Lieutenant-Governor of the Colony, shall be filled by— (1) Seven members of the Legislative Assembly to be elected by it from among the members thereof as soon as practicable after its first meeting; and (2) Four persons to be appointed thereto by the Governor in Council.

There is an exemption under the Act 5 and 6 Vict., c. 35, Section 88, in favour of Government Stock or dividends belonging to the Crown, and property belonging to and in the virtual occupation of the Crown is not assessed. Duty is paid in respect of the Estate of a member of the Royal Family, but not upon that of the Sovereign. The Royal Family are exempt from Legacy and Succession Duties, under the provisions of Acts of Parliament (35 George III., cap. 1, and Schedule; and 16 and 17 Vict., c. 51, Sec. 18); and also from the necessity for taking out Estab- lishment Licences (32 and 33 Vict., c. 14, Sec. 19). GRANTS TO THE ROYAL FAMILY. The grants made by Parliament, and now payable annually for the support of the Royal Family, in addition to the income granted to His Majesty, are as follows:- Prince of Wales†. Princess of Wales £20,000 10,000 His Majesty&apos;s daughters 18,000 Duke of Connaught 25,000 Princess Christian of Schles- wig-Holstein……………. 6,000 Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll 6,000 Princess Henry of Batten- berg 6,000 Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha 6,000 Duchess of Albany. 6,000 Duchess of Mecklenburg- Strelitz Total 3,000 .£106,000 Provision is also made for a contingent annuity of £70,000 for Her Majesty Queen Alexandra in the event of her widowhood, and of £30,000 for the Princess of Wales in the like event. The principles upon which the grants to the younger children of the Sovereign have been made in the past were clearly stated by Mr. Gladstone during the debate on the annuity to the Duke of Connaught, July 31, 1871. He reminded the House that Parliament had assented to an arrangement by which, instead of attempt- ing to make a general provision at the commencement of each reign for the pos- sible issue of the Sovereign, each particu- lar case had been dealt with as it arose. That arrangement had some disadvan- tages, inasmuch as it was liable to be misunderstood out of doors, and that, being so misunderstood, it was apt to cause unjust remarks to be made upon the Royal Family and the Sovereign. He con- sidered, however, that there were recom- mendations of a high order attaching to the present plan. In the first place, it was the one by far the most agreeable to the spirit of a free Constitution; it estab- lished a considerable degree of moral control which Parliament might otherwise lose. If the Sovereign were to be respon- sible for realizing out of his annual income funds sufficient to endow a family, how- ever numerous, in a manner becoming their station, it would be necessary to enlarge the allowance at the commence- ment of the reign; and, further, the arrangement would lose all its elasticity, because, whether the Sovereign had issue or not, the sum at his disposal would remain the same. The present method of provision also tended greatly to promote and confirm harmony between the great powers of the State. It placed the con- duct of the Sovereign and of the Royal Family, especially of its junior members, in view of the public and the Legislature, and, while preserving a salutary Parlia- mentary control, it likewise preserved in the hands of the Sovereign an important control over the younger branches of the Royal Family. Supposing the Sovereign were granted what was necessary for annual expenditure, but that every Royal Prince and Princess, on arriving at full age, or at marriage, should receive a fixed annuity, this moral and general control would be relaxed or destroyed. Mr. Glad- stone said that, in his opinion, the nature of the provision was excellent, as long as it was worked in a spirit of liberality, of prudence, and of attachment to the Sovereign; but it undoubtedly would be grievously marred, and might become hardly practicable or secure, were it un- fortunately to be dealt with in a different spirit. The arrangement between the Crown and Parliament was made by no written covenant, nor would it be possible to frame one without fettering the liberty of the people and Constitutional control. But there were other engagements besides written words, and it was recorded, beyond doubt, that Parliament was morall liable to deal with these cases when they arose. He referred to the terms of the Civil List Act, and the Report of the Committee of 1837, as showing that the income was bestowed upon the Sovereign after a care- ful investigation of details, and an exact appreciation of what each of the burdens would require in order to maintain the dignity of the Sovereign, and with it the dignity of the nation. As showing the + The Prince of Wales also receives the income of the Duchy of Cornwall estates, which amounted in 1905 to £77,490. &quot; &apos;508 ALIEN IMMIGRATION-continued.

There was, moreover, positive evidence that upon every previous occasion Parliament had, without question, by an overwhelming vote, admitted the virtual bond of honourable obligation to make such provision. After referring to numer- ous instances in previous reigns, Mr. Gladstone concluded by asserting that a long and unbroken series of practical acknowledgment by Parliament for gene- rations, embracing every possible case to which the principle could apply, consti- tuted a state of just expectation on the part of the Sovereign, from which it was impossible for Parliament to recede, and which it would be utterly unworthy of it to disregard.-Hansara&apos;s Debates, vol. 208, p. 571, ADDITIONAL GRANTS IN 1889. In July, 1889, Queen Victoria commun- icated to Parliament the approaching marriage of Princess Louise of Wales to the Duke of Fife, and requested that Parliament would make provision for her, and also for (the late) Prince Albert Victor. A committee was thereupon appointed, with instructions to inquire into the former practice with respect to provisions for Members of the Royal Family, and to report upon the principles which it is expedient to adopt in the future. The Report of the majority of the Committee was to this effect:- &amp;quot;That since the accession of the House of Hanover there is precedent for provision for every child of an Heir Apparent, and no precedent for the omission of such a provision; and there is also precedent for provision for the children of every child of every younger son of a Sovereign, and for provision for a younger son of the Heir Apparent. &amp;quot;The Committee cannot find that any notice has ever been given to the Crown by any resolution of the House of Commons, or in any declaration on behalf of a Government by a Minister of the Crown, that the practice which has heretofore prevailed in reference to making provision for members of the Royal Family would be changed; or that Her Majesty has had any ground for supposing that it was necessary for her to make provision for the members of her family. In view of these facts the Committee are of opinion that Her Majesty would have a claim on the liberality of Parliament should she think fit to apply for such grants as, in accordance with precedent, may become requisite for the support of the Royal Family. But the Committee have been informed that Her Majesty does not pro- pose to press this claim for the children of her daughters and younger sons; and with regard to the daughters and younger sons of future Sovereigns. the Committee are of opinion that at the proper time arrangements should be made under which no future claim of a similar kind can arise. &amp;quot;In order to prevent repeated applica- tions to Parliament, and to establish the principle that the provision for children should hereafter be made out of grants adequate for that purpose which have been assigned to their parents, the Committee recommend the creation of a special fund by the quarterly payment, during the present reign, of £9,000 out of the Con- solidated Fund. Out of this the Prince of Wales, with the sanction of Her Majesty, and the assent of the First Lord of the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Ex- chequer, would be empowered to make such assignments, and in such manner, to his children as he may think fit.&amp;quot; In accordance with this Report a Bill was passed through Parliament, receiving Royal assent on August 12th, 1889, by which an annual sum of £36,000 was assigned to H.R.H. Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, for the support of his children, in the manner recommended by the Com- mittee. This grant expired on July 22nd, 1901. REVISED GRANTS IN 1901. On His Majesty&apos;s accession the question of provision for the younger children of the Sovereign and the children of the Heir Apparent was considered by the Select Committee on the Civil List, who reported as follows:- &amp;quot;In the first place they recommend that an annuity of £20,000 shall be paid out of the Consolidated Fund to His Royal Highness the Duke of Cornwall and York (now Prince of Wales) who has succeeded to the Revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall. They also recom- mend the grant of an annuity of £10,000 to Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall and York (now Princess of Wales) during the continuance of her marriage with His Royal Highness. &amp;quot;Your Committee have carefully con- sidered whether it would be advisable that any provision, whether immediate or contingent, should be made at the present time for those children of the Heir Apparent who may reach an age at which they may require separate establishments; but in view of the youth of their Royal Highnesses and the &quot; &quot;119 THE HOUSE OF LORDS.

Mr. Harcourt (L.) said the Bill would make the suffrage residential. for the plural voter would elect to vote where he lived. The University voter with more than one vote would still be able to vote for his University. The system of registration and distribution required overhauling, but it must be deferred.-Lord Helmsley (C.) said the Govt. had realised that all the plural voters would be against them at the next general election. Mr. J. Ward (Lab.) argued in favour of manhood and woman- hood suffrage.-Mr. Akers-Douglas described the Bill as a disfranchising one, solely with the object of party advantage. Mr. A. Balfour complained that without proper consideration the University representation was to be destroyed. The change would also disfranchise all business men who did not live where they worked. The historical basis of our system was that members of Parliament should represent places. If it were to be dealt with on theoretical as apart from historical lines, manhood and woman- hood suffrage was defensible. Before making the change redistribution ought to be taken in hand. The sole design of the Govt. was to strengthen the electoral position of their party. Sir H. C.-Bannerman argued that the Bill disposed of an anomaly and aggravated none. It paved the way for the doctrine of the Unionist party, one vote one value.&apos; The present law allowed strangers to vote down residents, and town freeholders to dominate county divisions. He repudiated the theory that a man voted only as a propertied individual.—The amendment was rejected by 403 to 95, and the Bill was read a second time. May 14. In Committee on Cl. 1, Mr. M. Thomson (C.) moved that it should apply only to ownership votes, and permit the exercise of a second vote by an occupier. Negatived by 236 to 65.-Mr. Lane Fox (C.) proposed to allow a voter to vote in more than one county.-Negatived by 220 majority.-The question of Universities was raised by Mr. Cave, who moved to exempt them. The Bill, he said, would destroy University representation. Mr. Harcourt disclaimed such an intention and did not believe it would so result.—Mr. Asquith argued that University voters ought not to have separate treatment. The vote was merely obtained by payment on receiving the M.A. degree. The Bill enabled a University elector to elect his constituency.-Mr. Balfour defended the system of University representation. To abolish it indirectly, as the Bill did, was to trifle with the Constitution.—The amendment was rejected by 347 to 92.-Lord Helmsley (C.) proposed to allow a plural vote to an elector having a direct interest by ownership or occupation. Mr. Balfour asked the Govt. to make an exception in favour of business men, so that they might vote in the constituencies where they worked and in those where they lived.-Rejected by 348 to 83.-A proposal to allow a second vote at a by-election was defeated by a large majority.-The penalties under the Bill were then considered, and amendments thereto were also rejected. Oct. 24. An amendment by Lord R. Cecil to defer the operation of the Bill until 1915 was negatived by 307 to 89.-Mr. Cave moved that a plural voter should not be required to select the constituency in which he would vote, but should be free to vote in any one where he was registered.-Mr. Harcourt refused to accept the amendment, desiring to retain the principle of selection.—Mr. Wallace (L.) said the Govt. plan might dis- franchise numbers of the working classes.—Amendment rejected by 343 to 83.-Sir C. Dilke proposed that a plural voter should vote where he was qualified by residence, but that if he had residences in more than one constituency he should be required to make a selection.-Negatived without a division. Mr. A. Chamberlain moved an amendment providing that when a plural voter failed to make a choice he should vote in respect of his place of abode.-Sir E. Carson said the Bill was a mean attempt to deprive political opponents of the franchise. It was not the Bill of a statesman, but the Bill of a sneak.&amp;quot;-Amendment rejected by 326 to 80. Oct. 25. Further amendments by the Opposition to reduce the severe penalties in the Bill were discussed, and some mitigating proposals were accepted. Oct. 26. 66 The Committee discussed the conditions under which a voter might select a con- stituency in which to vote by a notice to the clerk of the county council or town clerk. -Amendments were, with few exceptions, either withdrawn or negatived.

(2) The Governor shall, as soon as practicable, cause to be compiled from the said list a list of the voters resident in each electoral division of the Colony at the date of the commencement of the framing of the aforesaid first mentioned list, and the list so compiled shall be the register of voters for such division until a new register is made as hereinafter prescribed.

They forgot the great truth of the English Constitution, that English law ought to guide and to protect the highest and the lowest in the realm alike. Yet great Constitutional progress was made during the reigns of the Stuart Kings, and the power of the Commons was asserted and established. The Petition of Right presen- ted to Charles I. in 1628 by the Commons, prayed (1) That no loan or tax be levied except by consent of Parliament. (2) That no man might he imprisoned but by legal process. (3) That soldiers and sailors should not be billeted in private houses. To these demands the King, after some delay, replied, &amp;quot;Soit droit comme il est désiré.&amp;quot; In 1641 the Star Chamber and the Courts of High Commission, the engines of arbi- trary power employed by the Tudors, were abolished, and the King&apos;s Council was deprived of the power of arbitrary imprisonment. In the reign of Charles II. (12 Car. 2, cap. 24) the old feudal rights of wardship, purveyance, and other ex- actions were abolished. The Act of Habeas Corpus was also passed in this reign (31 Car. 2, cap. 2), 1679. The Declaration of Right&amp;quot; drawn up by Parliament and accepted by William and Mary on their accession in 1688, may be said to have terminated the long struggle between the Crown and the people. The most essential articles of this declaration are the following:-&amp;quot;The King cannot dispense with laws without the consent of Parliament. He cannot erect any tribunal of his own will. He cannot levy money without a Parliamen- tary grant. No standing army to be kept in time of peace without consent of Parlia- ment. Excessive fines and immoderate punishments prohibited.&amp;quot; The Revolution of 1688 also established the important principle that the Sovereign shall profess the Protestant faith, and shall be bound to maintain the Protestant religion as by law established. In the Coronation oath he swears that he will &amp;quot;maintain the true profession of the Gospel and the Protes- tant reformed religion established by law.&amp;quot; The Bill of Rights (1689) and the Act of Settlement (1701) further enact that no person professing the Popish religion, or who shall marry a Papist, is capable of inheriting or possessing the Crown, and the people are released from their allegiance in such case. The Royal Prerogative in 1688 was described as follows in a pamphlet written in that year &amp;quot;The King has no preroga- tive but what the law gives him. We must not therefore presume a prerogative, and then conclude it law, but first find the law, and by it prove the prerogative, and when we have found the prerogative it must be measured by what the public good will bear. The King is supreme in the legislative part as well as in the executive part, but has not the whole supremacy in the legislative part as in the executive.&amp;quot; The following portion of the Corona- tion oath, as settled at the Revolution, is also interesting and instructive :-- &amp;quot;Question--Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of this United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the dominions thereto belong- ing according to the Statutes in Parlia- ment agreed on, and the respective laws and customs of the same? Answer-I solemnly promise so to do. Question-Will you to your power cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments? Answer-I will.&amp;quot; The During the reigns of the four Georges, the respective rights and duties of the King, Lords, and Commons were gradu- ally settled and acknowledged. King, however, exercised a far more active and direct authority than accords with the custom of the present day. George III., indeed, at the commence- ment of his reign, endeavoured to assert to the utmost extent the influence of the Sovereign. He permitted Lord Bute to hold a position of confidential adviser, independently of the Ministry and of Parliament. At a later period, during the administration of Lord North, the King assumed to himself the right of inter- ference in all the details of administra- tion. As soon, however, as Mr. Pitt was enabled, by the assistance of the Crown, but with the support of the country, to defeat the Opposition in the House of Commons, and at the General Election of 1784 to secure a majority for himself, he became the Minister in fact as well as in name, and the relations between the Sovereign and the Minister gradually approximated to the existing system. Although many of the powers of the Royal prerogative are dormant, the influence of the Crown is nevertheless deservedly great. And in the modified sense of the prerogative it has been said that the Crown has three rights-the right to be consulted, the right to en- courage, and the right to warn. Yet even now the power and preroga- tive of the Crown, and also its duties, are considerable. The King can prorogue or dissolve Parliament, even before it pro- ceeds to business, and he can create peers without restriction as to numbers. He can veto laws, and is the irresponsible- head of the Executive. The Sovereign is the Fountain of Justice&amp;quot;; that is, with the advice of his responsible Ministers, &quot; &apos;ALIEN IMMIGRATION-continued. 507 Alien Immigration.-Number of Aliens (exclusive of Vagrants) to whom Poor Law Relief was granted in the undermentioned Districts during the Years 1904 and 1905, distinguishing the Kind of Relief granted.

There was no information as to wounded Zulus having been killed by native levies. The report that Natal troops gave no quarter was denied. See also under S. AFRICA-TRANSVAAL. July 18. April 5. L-Agriculture.-CATTLE IMPORTATION.— -Lord Jersey (C.) pressed the Govt. not to relax the present regulations.—Lord Carrington (L.), Pres. of the Bd. of Agriculture, in reply, said that Canada had a very strong case, but a grave responsibility would be incurred if the restrictions were suddenly removed.-Lord Lansdowne (L.U.) appealed to the Govt. to lead and not to follow, and to state their definite views.-Lord Ripon (L.) said that difficulties surrounded the question, but hoped they would be shortly settled. April 5. C-Mr. Cairns (L.) moved the 2nd R. of a Bill to exempt Canadian cattle from the operation of the Act of 1896, and to enable them to be landed alive in Great Britain, and dispensing with the existing regulations as to slaughter and quarantine. The Act of 1896 had been protective in its effect. There was no danger of the introduction of disease. Mr. Warner (L.) moved to reject the Bill.-Mr. W. O&apos;Brien (N.) also opposed it in the interests of peasant proprietors in Ireland. Sir H. C.-Bannerman said the Liberal party had opposed the Act of 1896 as interfering with the freedom of the House. He was still of opinion that the question ought to be left to the discretion of the Bd. of Agriculture. There was, however, great diversity of opinion at the present moment, and much nervousness among agriculturists. He should leave the decision to the House.—Mr. Long (C.) contended that the existing restrictions were necessary to safeguard the health of our cattle.-The Speaker refused his consent to the closure, and the debate was adjourned. April 6. L-Lord Heneage (L. U.) moved a resolution deprecating the continued uncertainty as to the future policy of the Govt. in regard to restrictions on the importation of store cattle from Canada.-Lord Burghclere (L.) said there was no reason why the Act of 1896 should be considered unalterable.-Lord Carrington (L.), for the Govt., said they recognised the magnitude of the interests involved, and would not bring in any measure this year to repeal the Act of 1896.-Lord Lansdowne (L.U.) said the Prime Minister had caused much anxiety by declaring that the Act of 1896 must go, and farmers should not be kept in uncertainty on a matter of vital interest to them.-Lord Ripon (L.) repeated that the Govt. had no intention to repeal or alter the Act of 1896.-The resolution was withdrawn. May 21. C-In Supply, various agricultural matters were discussed, including those of pre- ferential railway rates and the exclusion of foreign live stock. The vote for the Bd. of Agriculture was agreed to. July 13. L-HORSES.-Lord Donoughmore (C.) moved that steps should be taken to improve the breeding of horses by giving effect to the recommendations of the Royal Com- mission.-Lord Carrington (L.) admitted that there was a scarcity of mares and that foreign buyers were getting the best.

In the debate on the Address, Sir W. Evans-Gordon (C.) moved an amendment regretting the omission of any reference to the exclusion of foreign contract labour during trade disputes.-Mr. Crooks (Lab.) said his party intended to bring in a Bill relating to alien labour, and expected it to pass without opposition.- Mr. J. Chamberlain argued that it was inconsistent to prohibit the immigration of alien labourers and at the same time to permit the free importation of alien goods.-Amend- ment withdrawn. Feb. 26. Sir W. Evans-Gordon called attention to the Home Office instructions under the Aliens Act, and contended that they went far to frustrate the intentions of Parliament. -Mr. Gladstone (L.), Home Secy., said he intended to give the Act a fair trial, and to safeguard immigrants fleeing from religious or political persecution.-Sir E. Carson (C.) said the amended regulations were not contrary to the spirit of the Act. March 14. L-Lord Newton (C.) called attention to the same subject.-Lord Beauchamp (L.) said the orders in no way interfered with the exclusion of criminal and diseased aliens. -Lord Halsbury (C.) held that the regulations were contrary to the Act of Parliament, which contained express directions, and had been set at nought.--Lord Fitzmaurice (L.) said the Act had already given rise to many complaints from foreign countries. March 22. 19 &quot; &quot;404 POLITICAL NOTES. THE EDUCATION BILL, 1906-continued. AS IT LEFT THE COMMONS. Attendance during time for Religious Instruction not to be required. 7.-The parent of a child attending a public elementary school shall not be under any obligation to cause the child to attend at the schoolhouse, except during the times allotted in the time table exclusively to secular instruction. AS IT LEFT THE LORDS. instruction given in any public elemen- tary school provided by them, by a person not being one of His Majesty&apos;s inspectors, and shall, if required by or on behalf of persons who are responsible for the provision of religious instruction of some special character in pursuance of any facilities afforded as a condition of any arrangement or order of the Com- mission with respect to a schoolhouse or of the purchase or hire of a schoolhouse or afforded as extended facilities under this Act, and, if the authority are satisfied that there are at least thirty children ordinarily receiving that religious in- struction, give up at least one full and unbroken school day annually for the purpose of the inspection of the special religious instruction, and allow the use of the schoolhouse for the purpose free of charge. (2) During the hours given up to any inspection for which an opportunity is afforded under this section, the school shall be closed for any purpose other than that of the inspection. (3) No part of the expenses of con- ducting any inspection of religious in- struction of a special character for which an opportunity is afforded under this section shall be paid by the local educa- tion authority. (4) At least fourteen days before an inspection is held in pursuance of this section, notice of the time set apart for the inspection shall be read out publicly in the school. Provision as to attendance during time allotted to Religious Instruction. 8. The obligation of a parent to cause his child to attend school shall, notwith- standing any bye-law, include an obliga- tion to cause the child to attend at the schoolhouse during the portion of the school hours allotted to instruction in religious subjects. Provided that the local education authority and the mana- gers shall provide during the time so allotted for children who are withdrawn by their parents from any such instruction some form of secular instruction, and that a parent shall not be subject to any penalty under this section for not causing his child to attend the schoolhouse during any time so allotted, if he shows to the satisfaction of the court that he has caused his child during that time to attend some form of religious instruction elsewhere. &quot; &apos;HOUSE OF COMMONS-PROCEDURE. 131 the suspended Bill might present the Bill in the form in which it stood when the Proceedings thereon were sus- pended; and the Questions on the First and Second Readings thereof should be successfully put forthwith. &quot;If both Questions be carried, the Bill would be ordered to be printed; and, if it had been partly considered in Committee in the previous Session, the Committee would begin their considera- tion of the Bill at the Clause on which Progress was reported in the previous Session; but if it had been reported from Committee in the previous Session, its consideration, as reported, would be appointed for that day week. If the First or Second Reading were negatived, such Vote was not to pre- clude the House from entertaining a Bill on the same subject under the ordinary Rules of Procedure.&quot; The Committee pointed out that the proposed Standing Order was limited to Bills which had originated in one House and which had never left it, and they recorded their opinion that neither House could, of its own authority, postpone to a future Session any Bill sent to it from the other House without a breach of con- stitutional usage. The Committee summarised the various considerations as follows:- :- &quot;The length of discussion to which it is thought necessary to subject measures which are the object of party controversy has increased, is increasing, and does not seem likely to diminish. As a result, the difficulty of passing such measures through all their stages in the course of one Session has increased likewise. This difficulty is especially felt in the case of 1 long and complicated Bills, and it is pre- cisely in the case of these Bills that the closure of debate is most ineffective as an instrument for facilitating the rapid progress of business. It is, therefore, desirable to increase the power of the House of Commons to deal with such measures ; it is also desirable to shorten the length of Sessions, whose present duration overtaxes the endurance of Members and embarrasses the machinery of administration; but it is not desirable, so long as any other alternative remains, to increase the stringency of the existing machinery for closing debate. Your Com- mittee believe that if these three principles be accepted every possible alternative is excluded, except one which shall relieve Parliament in certain cases from the necessity of repeating in two successive Sessions the same debate upon the same questions. They attach no weight, for reasons above given, to any objections that have suggested themselves to this plan, based upon the relations now exist- ing between the two Houses of Parliament. They think the change, though un- doubtedly an important one, is much less violent in character and much less at variance with the spirit of Parliamentary tradition than some alterations wh ch have been made of late years in Parlia- mentary procedure; and they point out that if, as they recommend, it be effected, by Standing Order instead of by Bill, the experiment may be purely tentative, and could be abandoned, should that course be subsequently thought desirable, by the sole action of the House of Commons, without requiring the consent of the other branch of the Legislature.&quot; &apos; &apos;PARLIAMENTARY SUMMARY, 1906. 337 C-*Plural Voting Bill-continued. a franchise Bill, and there was no need for a saving&quot; clause.-Mr. Akers-Douglas reminded him that the Govt. had throughout said it was not a disfranchising Bill.– The clause was negatived by 306 to 87.-Mr. Harcourt agreed to accept a clause that no proceedings should be taken except on the fiat of the Attorney-General.-The Bill eventually passed the Committee stage. Oct. 31. Sir H. C.-Bannerman moved a closure by compartment resolution, allotting two days to Report and one for the 3rd R.-Mr. Balfour deprecated the curtailment of debate on a great disfranchising measure. No Govt. had applied closure by com- partments to a Bill of that kind. The resolution was carried by 320 to 87.-The Report stage was then begun, and a number of new clauses were proposed and negatived. Nov. 26. Mr. Harcourt proposed a new clause that a prosecution for an offence should only be instituted by consent of a law officer.-Agreed to.-Other clauses were debated and rejected. Lord R. Cecil proposed a clause which involved the female franchise question, and would have deferred the operation of the Bill until after the general election, unless women suffrage was first granted.-Mr. Balfour supported the clause. -Rejected by 278 to 50.—The remaining new clauses were guillotined. Nov. 27. The Report stage was concluded after numerous divisions on amendments, many of which were similar to those negatived in Committee. The Bill was ordered for 3rd R. Nov. 28. On the 3rd R., Sir H. Kimber (C.) moved a hostile amendment.-Mr. F. E. Smith (C.) argued strongly against the Bill, which he hoped the House of Lords would reject.— Mr. Harcourt declined, on behalf of the Govt., to delay the Bill until a Redistribution Bill could be proceeded with. Their object was not to strike at political opponents, but the abolition of the pluralist.-Sir C. Dilke (L.) said he disapproved of the plan of the Bill, though not of its object.-Mr. Balfour said it was admitted that its machinery was extremely defective. Radical Governments pledged to social reforms always postponed them in order to perpetuate some political dodge of this kind; and so the great measures of social reform had been Tory or Unionist.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman replied. He said there was a good deal of make-believe in the fears expressed as to the results of this Bill, and it was ridiculous to suggest that the State would be injured in consequence of the abolition of the plural vote.-The amendment was rejected by 333 to 104, and the Bill was read a third time. Dec. 3. L-Lord Beauchamp moved the 2nd R. of the Bill.-Lord St. Aldwyn (C.) moved an amendment declaring that, while the House was willing to consider a complete scheme for reform of the Parliamentary franchise, it declined to take into consideration a Bill which imposed penalties for the exercise of a franchise by persons to which it was entrusted by law and did nothing to remove the most glaring inequalities in the distri- bution of electoral power. He said the Bill was passed by large majorities in the other House, but only by the forcible suppression of debate. The House had always maintained that when the Parliamentary franchise was dealt with it should be dealt with as a whole; but this B.ll was a petty measure of disfranchisement, and no word had been said as to redistribution. It would extinguish University representation, which had worked well.-Lord Courtney said that the House, by adhering to small privileges, might endanger more important ones.-Lord Lansdowne referred to the anomalies with which the Bill did not deal, in Ireland, Scotland and Wales; and said that in England one Liberal member represented 7,000 voters, while a Unionist member represented 17,000 voters. The sole object of the Bill was to diminish the strength of the Opposition. He hoped the House would reject the Bill.-Lord Ripon having replied, a division was taken, and the amendment was carried by 143 to 43, so that the 2nd R. was defeated. Dec. 10. C-*Post Office.-A long debate took place on the Govt. resolution for the appoint- ment of a Committee to inquire as to the wages and position of the Post Office servants, especially on the selection of the members of the Committee.-A motion to adjourn the debate was negatived by 311 to 107.-Eventually Ministers agreed to enlarge the number of the Committee to nine, and to include the engineering, stores, and factories departments in the scope of the inquiry. March 6. In Committee of Supply, Mr. Buxton (L.), Postmr.-Genl., introduced the Post Office Vote of £16,746,000, and announced reductions in the rates for parcel post, postal orders, and the postage of commercial papers; and also in the charges for books, &amp;amp;c., for the use of the blind. The Imperial Penny Post, he stated, now extended practically to all parts of the Empire. He would do all he could to carry out the fair wages resolution of the House; and had resolved to concede to postal servants the full right of combination and representation.-A general discussion followed, and eventually the vote was agreed to. June 21. &apos; &quot;453 GLOSSARY OF Address, The, in answer to the King&apos;s Speech, was formerly a series of resolutions passed by both Houses echoing the language of the Speech, but in recent years its form has been much modified, and it is usually now a simple expression of thanks to His Majesty. An amend- ment to the Address is one of the forms of expressing approval or disapprobation of the policy of the Government, and if carried is incor- porated in the Address and presented to the King. The passage of a hostile amendment usually involves the resignation of the Government. Addresses to the Crown proceeding from individuals are presented through the Secretary of State for the Home Department. Adjournment.-See Prorogation. Adullamites.-See Cave. Ad valorem Dut7.-(Lat. valor, value). A duty charged at a certain rate per cent. on the value of goods, leases, &amp;amp;c.

Those issued in 1878 were consolidated with the Mutiny Act, in the Army Discipline Act, 1879, now replaced by the Army Act, 1881. Naval Articles of War are of a similar nature. They have been incorporated in the Naval Dis- cipline Act. POLITICAL TERMS.

HISTORY. In the Sovereign and the three estates of the realm-viz., the Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal, and the Commons, is vested supreme legislative authority in this country. The growth of the power of the House of Commons the third estate-is a prominent feature in our history from the reign of Henry III downwards. In early Saxon times, the Witenagemot (general council or assembly of wise men) exercised many of the functions which were afterwards assumed by Parliament. This assembly was not called together by Royal warrant, but met of its own accord. Every freeman possessed the right of taking part in its deliberations, although the expense of attending from a distance practically limited the exercise of the privilege to the richer nobility and the higher ecclesiastics. The Witenagemot in theory elected the king. It had a voice in the determination of war and peace, and in general matters of State policy. It acted as a court of appeal, and its authority appears to have been necessary for the imposition of extra- ordinary taxation. After the Conquest, the Witenagemot gave place to the Great Council of the Realm, first summoned in 1070, and at- tended by twelve representatives from every county. This was no longer a meeting of the ordinary freemen, but representation was based on land tenure, and the Council became a court of the vassals of the Crown, composed of bishops, abbots, earls, barons, and knights, who held land directly from the king. Under the first Norman kings the authority of the Great Council was limited. It still, indeed, discussed questions of foreign and general policy, and enjoyed a certain legislative authority, but it had no power to join in taxation and although its &amp;quot;Counsel and Consent was necessary in matters of fiscal as well as of political importance, its functions seem to have become almost nominal. In the reign of Henry II (A.D. 1151 to 1189), its authority was considerably extended, and about this time it began to be summoned regularly, and the Commons were admitted to its deliberations. Although it engaged in the discussion of taxation, yet the Crown resolutely main- tained that the sole right to levy taxes on the subject was vested in the Sovereign. During the troubled times of John&apos;s reign, however, the authority of the Great Council increased rapidly, and in 1215, in the Magna Charta, its constitution was more clearly defined and its powers over taxation were first formally recognised, by the enactment that no burthen beyond the customary feudal aids might be imposed, &amp;quot;save by the Common Council of the Realm.&amp;quot; 99 There was as yet but one assembly, but it is to be noticed that in Magna Charta, for the first time, an important distinction was made between the &amp;quot;greater&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;lesser barons ; the former, it was enacted should be summoned to the Council personally by special writ, but the latter were to be called together by a general writ addressed to the sheriffs. In this, according to Mr. Freeman, lay the germ- of popular representation. Up to this time the towns had enjoyed comparative immunity from taxation, but their growing importance, and the in- creasing wealth of the mercantile class, which was not represented in the Great Council, made it desirable, as a means of making taxation more efficient, that the towns should be brought into contact with the central authority. Accordingly, in 1265, Simon de Montfort, in the king&apos;s name, summoned a parliament at West- minster, and besides requiring the atten- dance of two knights from every shire, he ordered the return of two citizens or bur- gesses from each town. The Parliament of 1265, therefore, was the first distinct foundation of a system of popular repre- sentation. During the reign of the first three Edwards the assembly was in a period of transition, and at the close of the reign of Edward III the division into Lords and Commons had become apparent. In that reign it was the practice for the prelates, with the clergy, to consult by themselves: the nobles by themselves: and the knights and burgesses by themselves: but sending the result of their deliberations collectively to the king. The clergy and baronage- the official and hereditary element--gradu- ally became an upper Assembly, while the union of the knights of the shire with the burgesses became known as the &amp;quot;Com- mons. Under the strong-willed Tudor dynasty the Commons displayed little in- dependence (although they refused to accede to some of the demands of Henry VIII), and it was not till the accession of the House of Stuart that the long struggle between the Sovereign and the Parliament began. By making the grant of supplies contingent upon the redress of grievances, the House of Commons during the Stuart dynasty was able to greatly extend and consolidate its auth rity. The unyielding disposition of Charles I led him to attempt &quot; &quot;CONSTITUENCIES AND ELECTIONS. 211 GL. .C. GL. 3,078 SCOTLAND--CITIES AND BURGHS--continued. Kirkcaldy District-continued. 1892.

Lord Selborne agreed that this was a fair and just settlement. On this basis the Transvaal Assembly, of 69 members, would be elected for five years, and would receive payment. The Speaker would vacate his seat on his election. Members would be at liberty to speak either in Dutch or English. He hoped that the Government would be a coalition one, acceptable to all parties. There was to be a Second Chamber in the first Parliament, and the members, numbering 15, would be nominated by the Crown. The franchise could not be extended to the natives, but all legislation affecting them would be reserved for approval by the Colonial Secretary. Swaziland would remain under the High Com- missioner. On 30th November, 1906, all recruiting of Chinese labour would cease. In the interests of British settlers a Land Board under the High Commissioner would be established to administer the funds.-Mr. Lyttelton (L.U.) questioned the advisa- bility of granting the Transvaal responsible government so soon after the war. The Govt. had acted before they knew the facts, and had made promises with rash pre- cipitation. A hazardous experiment ought not to be made in S. Africa as long as there was marked racial division. The grant of responsible government was made that the Govt. might shelve on to other shoulders their responsibilities in regard to Chinese labour and the Civil Service.-Sir C. Dilke (L.) condemned the proposal for the creation of a Second Chamber.-Mr. Arnold-Forster asked whether in their opinion the course the Govt. were taking meant keeping or losing S. Africa. It was too much to imagine that in the four years since the war the passions engendered by that great conflict had been completely allayed.- Mr. Balfour asked what was the justifying reason for giving the Transvaal full autonomy at the present juncture. It was a most dangerous, audacious, and reckless experiment. What was there to prevent the Assembly from making preparations for another war? There was no security against Imperial danger.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman described this as an unworthy speech, an epithet which was strongly resented by the Opposition.-The time having arrived for the closure of Supply, the Vote was carried by 316 to 83. July 31. Mr. Churchill announced that a Transvaal Boer, one Ferreira, had crossed into the Transvaal from German territory with 11 armed followers, had injured two policemen and stolen horses, arms and ammunition. Steps were being taken for his capture. Nov. 12. L-Lord Lovat asked the intentions of the Govt. in regard to land settlement in the Transvaal and Orange River Colonies.-Lord Elgin said that he had made a state- ment with regard to it in July which was regarded as satisfactory. They had endeavoured to obtain all the information they could to enable them to arrive at a satisfactory decision. It was necessary before he could give a full answer to get further information.-Lord Durham (L.) said the Govt. ought to make a clear straightforward statement on the subject.--Lord Milner said the question was one of vital urgency. The settlers ought not to be neglected, as the Boers would give them no assistance. There was an obligation of honour on the Govt., which they could not neglect, to men who had staked their lives and fortunes.-Lord Courtney (L.) said the land settlement policy was foredoomed to failure.-Lord Lansdowne asked for an assurance that this little Imperial outpost would not be left to the ruin which threatened them.-Lord Ripon said the question raised was mixed up with the Letters Patent, and the time was not yet ripe for a statement. Nov. 14. C-Mr. Lehmann (L.) moved the adjournment, to call attention to the conditions prevailing in the Chinese compounds, as revealed by Mr. Bucknill&apos;s report to the Govt.-A considerable debate ensued.-Mr. Churchill said the Govt. could not publish Mr. Bucknill&apos;s report. The offence with which it dealt was not a matter of open public scandal, nor had it been tolerated by the Govt., the police, or the mine owners. The responsibility, he said, rested largely and primarily on the ex-Colonial Secy. The Govt. intended to act vigorously. The last shipload of coolies had gone to S. Africa, and the Govt. would take all practicable steps to stamp out this evil.— Mr. Lyttelton complained that Mr. Bucknill&apos;s report had been seen by Liberal members. but had not been communicated to the Opposition. While he was Colonial Secy. there was no evidence of the existence of this moral canker in the compounds. It was unknown to our officials, and could not have been ignored and countenanced by them.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman admitted that Mr. Lyttelton ought to have been shown the report, which justified the measures the Govt. were going to take. — The motion was talked out by Mr. Markham. Nov. 15. -The Abp. of Canterbury asked the Colonial Secy. for any information respecting the inquiry as to the prevalence of vice in the Chinese compounds. He felt bound to refer to the matter, however painful.-Lord Elgin explained that the report was &quot; &quot;BRANCHES OF EXPENDITURE-continued. 469 REMARKS. +511,023 43,894 317,054 94,683 740,614 †The separate amounts being in 1904-5, England £300,172, Scotland £103,773, and Ireland £110,056; and in 1905-06, England £1,085,094, Scot- land £79,432, and Ireland £352,170.

Cls. 4 and 5 and the financial resolution in exchange for two Saturday sittings, and two days to Cls. 6 and 7.-The resolution, as amended, was agreed to. June 18. Lord R. Cecil (C.) moved to confine the subsection to purely educational trusts of a purely educational character, leaving out religious and charitable trusts. -Mr. Birrell said the use of the school buildings by local authorities would be for educational purposes only. Trusts which did not hamper school work would not be interfered with.-Amendment rejected by 357 to 95.-Mr. Middlemore (L.U.) moved to omit the subsection giving owners of schoolhouses of voluntary schools, subject to charitable trusts, full power to make any arrangement under the clause. The Bill, he said, was a sort of robbery, as it contemplated the confiscation of trusts.-Mr. Birrell said that many previous Parliaments had interfered with trust arrangements, and that trusts ought to be reviewed from time to time, and diverted into useful channels.-Sir W. Anson (L.U.) declared that it was unfair to treat trustees of the voluntary schools as mendicants for public funds. Amendment withdrawn.-An amendment by Sir E. Carson to prevent trustees from surrendering more than educational interests was negatived by a majority of 311.-Mr. Lough moved a new provision to confer on local authorities a right to undertake to give in transferred schools religious instruction which did not conflict with Sec. 14 of the Act of 1870; and to enact that nothing in Cl. 2 should prevent the granting or requiring of facilities for special religious instruction in a transferred school. Agreed to after much debate. Mr. Balfour defended the Act of 1902 in regard to trust deeds, saying that the alterations effected under it were made for the purpose of adapting the deeds to the objects for which the voluntary schools were created. The present Govt., however, desired to destroy these schools, and to modify the trusts with that object. Pledges as to facilities in voluntary schools would be worthless unless the authorities were compelled to assent to the transfer of the schools.—Mr. Birrell said he intended to be faithful to all his pledges, and if he could not carry them out he should retire. The closure came into force at 10.30 p.m., and the clause was carried by 424 to 109. June 19. On Cl. 3 (if facilities for denominational instruction has been made a condition of transfer, such facilities shall be given on two mornings a week). Mr. P. Pease (L.U.) moved to compel local authorities to arrange for special religious teaching whenever the owners desired.-Mr. Birrell announced that the Govt. would be willing on the 6th Cl. to consider the proposal for compulsory attendance during the hours for religious teaching. They did not intend that local authorities should be able to refuse to take over schools merely because religious facilities were stipulated for. A local authority taking over a school must grant facilities, but they would not be compelled to take over schools which they did not require. When a local authority desired to take over a school and the trustees desired religious facilities, such facilities would be given.- Mr. Channing (L.) and others deprecated thus whittling away the discretionary authority of local authorities.-The amendment was rejected by 387 to 99.-Lord R. Cecil moved that special religious instruction should be given in a transferred voluntary school when the parents of 15 children desired it.-Mr. Masterman (L.) supported the amendment so that Nonconformists might not be at a disadvantage in Anglican schools. Mr. Lough argued that this pan-denominationalism was impracticable, and Dr. Macnamara thought it would introduce pandemonium.-Mr. Birrell declined to accept the proposal. Mr. Balfour said that in Scotland a plan of this kind was carried out without difficulty and without offence.-Rejected by 285 to 78.-Mr. Birrell explained that the clause, while allowing every child to receive denominational instruction on two days a week, allowed it to be given on more days when the conditions of the school rendered it necessary, so that all the children might receive it-Mr. Perks (L.) said it was a revelation that ministers might be admitted into transferred schools every day. Mr. Birrell repeated that if all the children could not receive denominational instruction on the same two days facilities must be provided on other days. The matter would be for the local authorities to arrange. The clause was agreed to under closure. June 20. On Cl. 4 (local authority may afford extended facilities for denominational instruction in any transferred school in an urban area when the parents of four-fifths of the children attending the school so desire), Mr. E. Cecil (C.) moved that the clause should be man- datory, as if left optional different denominations would not receive equal treatment. -Mr. Birrell said his object was to prevent the improper refusal of facilities in voluntary schools, and that he would give a right of appeal to the Bd. of Education, who, after inquiry, would prescribe the terms on which the school should be transferred, including extended facilities; or, as an alternative, the Board might allow a school to stand apart as a State-aided school receiving the Parliamentary grant, but not &quot; &apos;AND EXPENDITURE. 463 £ Civil Services- £ £ Fee and Patent Stamps 984,000 Class i.-Works and Buildings 2,548,423 Receipts by Civil Departments 60,832 &quot;&quot; ii.-Public Departments 2,616,697 Other Miscellaneous Receipts 189,712 &quot;&quot; iii.-Law and Justice (see also Salaries, &amp;amp;c., charged on the Consolidated Fund) 3,770,674 Total Miscellaneous Receipts 1,516,196 &quot;&quot; iv.-Education, Science, and Art 16,396,481 99 v.-Foreign and Colonial Services 1,961,481 &quot;&quot; vi.-Non-effective and Charitable vii.-Miscellaneous 803,180 99 333,063 28,429,999 Revenue Departments- Customs Inland Revenue 931,000 2,217,000 Total for Revenue Departments.. 3,148,000 Telegraph Service, Cost of 4,648,000 Deduct-Revenue from Telegraph Service. 4,130,000 Deficiency on Telegraph Service. 518,000 *Total Expenditure Balance-Excess of Income over Expenditure Total Income £128,474,520 *£125,008,900 3,465,620 £128,474,520 £ *Total Expenditure-as above *Charge for National Debt-as above Amount included in the foregoing, representing repayment of Debt £ 125,008,900 27,981,975 Total for National Debt, exclusive of repayments.. 8,790,000 19,191,975 8,428,000 Total Expenditure in 1905-1906, exclusive of repayment of Debt. 116,580,900 NOTE.-In the above statement an attempt has been made to place the financial affairs of the Country before the public in as clear and intelligible a manner as possible, and to make those deductions on both sides of the account which appear to be necessary to bring the final totals of Income and Expenditure to their proper limits. In putting forward this statement it s proper to make the following observations as to the particulars of which it consists :- (a) It should be stated, in the first place, that the items in the above account represent the actual receipts into, and issues from, the Exchequer during the year 1905-1906. (b) The table does not include receipts on account of Advances for Public Works, nor payments on account of the sums raised to make those Advances, these receipts and payments having been transferred to the &quot;Local Loans Fund&quot; under the provisions of the &quot;National Debt and Local Loans Act, 1887.&quot; (c) The receipts under the Head of Excise are exclusive of the additional Beer and Spirit Duties, and also of the Licence Duties, transferred to Local Taxation Account, amounting to £5,342,587. (d) The receipts under the head of Death Duties are exclusive of the proportion of the old Probate Duty and New Estate Duty receipts paid to Local Taxation Account, amounting together to £4,376,843. (e) In virtue of Treasury Minutes issued under the &quot; Public Accounts and Charges Act,&quot; 1891, the Miscellaneous Receipts of the Revenue Departments, and the bulk of the Extra Receipts of the Civil Departments, are now appropriated by the Departments concerned in aid of their expenditure. &apos; &quot;X INDEX.

C-Education-*EDUCATION BILL-continued. Cl. 8 was again debated at much length and numerous amendments were rejected. -Sir W. Anson moved that the Commission should require the local authority to comply with such conditions as to rent as might be thought just.-Mr. Birrell conceded the point, but was again attacked by Mr. Perks for the concession.-Sir F. Powell (C.) moved to give a right of appeal from the decision of the Commission.-Rejected by a majority of 167.-The clause was afterwards passed by a large majority. July 9. Cl. 9, which dealt with the appointment of three Commissioners to make schemes respecting school buildings under trust was debated and agreed to.-On Cl. 10, giving local authorities a right to use without payment voluntary school buildings held under trusts, Mr. Cave moved to strike out the words &amp;quot;without payment.&amp;quot;-Negatived by 343 to 98.-Mr. Birrell, referring to the teachers, said that they would be appointed by the managers, and the head teacher would be denominational, and the managers would take care that they were qualified to give the specified religious instruction. He moved an amendment to that effect, which evoked strong opposition from Mr. Perks (L.) and others.-The amendment was carried by 369 to 51.-Mr. Ashley moved to exclude privately owned schools from Cl. 11.-Mr. Birrell said it would be absurd to allow a private owner to turn the building into a greenhouse or stable.— The amendment was rejected, and the closure resolution coming into force, the clause was carried by 395 to 108.-Cls. 12 and 13 were afterwards passed.—Part II. of the Bill was deleted. July 10. On Cl. 26 (delegation of powers to urban and rural district councils), Mr. G. White (L.) moved to compel local authorities to delegate some of their functions.-Mr. Balfour said he was in favour of using more freely the powers of the Act of 1902 in delegating to the managers administrative and clerical work.-Mr. Birrell said the clause left the initiative with the parishes, and he was willing to enlarge the powers and to sub- stitute other provisions for the clause as it stood.-Mr. Balfour suggested that the problem should be dealt with by a separate Bill.-Amendment and clause negatived. -Cl. 28, extending to 60 years the period for repayment of money borrowed by a county council, was carried by 309 votes to 72.-On Cl. 29 (abolishing the rate-limit of 2d. for secondary education), Mr. H. Cox (L.) argued against further local expenditure on higher education, and moved an amendment that before exceeding the limit, a county council should obtain the sanction of the ratepayers.-Mr. Birrell disagreed with limiting county councils to 2d., and the amendment was rejected by 389 to 90, and the clause carried.-Clauses up to Cl. 33 were passed by closure. July 11. On Cl. 35 (vacation schools, etc.), Mr. Balfour moved an amendment (subsequently withdrawn) to secure that children attending the schoolhouses during holidays should not be troubled with book work.-Mr. Birrell agreed to bring up words on Report to meet his views.-The question of the compulsory medical inspection of children was discussed, and an amendment in that sense was moved by Mr. H. Tennant (L.) and strongly supported.—Mr. Balfour favoured the demand for an anthropometric survey conducted on a scientific plan.—Mr. Birrell agreed that it was most desirable that we should be able to compare one generation with another. and that inspection need not be very expensive. He was willing to have compulsory inspection when a child entered a school, and on other occasions under the direction of the Board of Education. and would move an amendment on Report.-Amendment withdrawn.-The question of providing scholarships or bursaries for children attending elementary schools was also discussed. An amendment to enable local authorities to provide them was carried by 391 to 86. The clause having been agreed to, clauses up to 36 were passed under the closure resolution. July 16. On Part IV. of the Bill, Cl. 37 (central education authority for Wales), Mr. Lloyd- George took charge of the Bill, and announced some modifications of the proposal. He should move for the appointment of a special Minister responsible to Parliament for the central council&apos;s action under its delegated powers. The council would prepare the Education Code in the first instance, but it must be passed by the Minister, who would lay before Parliament annually a statement as to the sums to be distributed in grants. When facilities for religious instruction were refused by local authorities, appeals would lie to the Bd. of Education. The new council was welcomed by 80 per cent. of the Churchmen of Wales, subject to certain safeguards.—Mr. Balfour, while welcoming the concessions, said it was preposterous for the Govt. to throw down a completely new scheme and the creation of a new Minister on the very night when the guillotine would fall. The status of Wales in education was fundamentally altered. It was a deliberate insult.—Mr. Asquith described Mr. Balfour&apos;s speech as an artificially engendered passion.-After further protests by the Opposition, Mr. Lloyd-George moved that the Order in Council establishing the Welsh council should provide for the appointment of a member of &quot; &quot;POLITICAL NOTES. 409 THE EDUCATION BILL, 1906-continued. AS IT LEFT THE COMMONS. under this Act as where an arrangement is made for the use of a schoolhouse except that the local education authority shall not make any alteration which is of a permanent character, or will interfere with the use of the schoolhouse for any purpose for which it has been previously used, and shall permit the religious instruction given in the school to be of the same character as that previously given, and shall also permit the teachers in the school to give that instruction as part of their duties, and if a vacancy arise in the office of teacher while the school- house is used under this section, the local education authority shall, in choosing the teacher, appoint a teacher who is willing to give the religious instruction required under this section. (3) An arrangement or a scheme may be made under this Part of this Act with reference to a schoolhouse used under the powers given by this section not- withstanding that it is so used; but where such a scheme or arrangement is made, the provisions of this section shall cease to apply on the date when the scheme or arrangement commences to take effect. Temporary Restriction on Closing of Voluntary Schools. 12.-(1) An existing voluntary school shall not be closed at any time between the passing of this Act and the first day of January One thousand nine hundred and eight except with the sanction of the Board of Education, and if the managers of any such school in cases where no such sanction is given are unwilling or fail to carry on the school during that period, the local education authority may carry on the school, as a school provided by them, until the first day of January One thousand nine hundred and ten, and for that purpose shall, notwithstanding any trust or condition on which the schoolhouse is held, have full authority to use that schoolhouse for the purposes of the school. (2) If the owners of the schoolhouse refuse to give such possession of the schoolhouse as is required for the pur- poses of this section, that possession may be obtained, whatever may be the value or rent of the schoolhouse, by or on behalf of the local education authority, either under sections one hundred and thirty-eight to one hundred and forty- five of the County Courts Act, 1888, or under the Small Tenements Recovery AS IT LEFT THE LORDS. (2) While a schoolhouse is used under the powers given by this section, the same conditions and provisions shall apply under this Act as where an arrange- ment is made for the use of a schoolhouse, except that the local education authority shall not make any alteration which is of a permanent character, or will interfere with the use of the schoolhouse for any purpose for which it has been previously used, and shall permit the religious instruction given in the school to be of the same character as that previously given, and shall also permit the teachers in the school to give that instruction as part of their duties, and if a vacancy arises in the office of teacher while the schoolhouse is used under this section, the local education authority shall, in choosing the teacher, appoint a teacher who is willing to give the religious instruction required under this section. (3) An arrangement or order may be made under this Part of this Act with reference to a schoolhouse used under the powers given by this section notwith- standing that it is so used; but where such an arrangement or order is made, the provisions of this section shall cease to apply on the date when the arrange- ment or order commences to take effect. Temporary restriction on Closing of Voluntary Schools. 17.-(1) An existing voluntary school shall not be closed at any time between the passing of this Act and the first day of July One thousand nine hundred and eight (or the appointed date, if the school is in an area for which a later date is appointed for the operation of section one of this Act) except with the sanction of the Board of Education, and if the managers of any such school in cases where no such sanction is given are unwilling or fail to carry on the school during that period, the local education authority may carry on the school, as a school provided by them, until the first day of July One thousand nine hundred and ten, and for that purpose shall, notwithstanding any trust or condition on which the schoolhouse is held, have full authority to use that schoolhouse for the purposes of the school.

Saunderson (C.) said the Bill was one which united all the Irish members.- The Bill was read a second time, and referred to the Standing Committee on Law. June 13. L-Lord Denman (L.) moved the 2nd R. of the Bill which, he said, was approved of by both parties. After some discussion the motion was agreed to, and the Bill was read a second time, July 27, and subsequently became law. (See STATUTES, post.) C-*LAND QUESTION.-In Supply on the Irish Estimates a prolonged discussion took place on the vote for the Land Commission. Mr. J. Redmond said the Commission had been manned for 20 years by broken-down landlords, land agents, retired military men, and hangers-on of the Tory party. Many of them had been reappointed by the new Chief Secy. against the advice of the Nationalist members. He also complained that little had been done to restore evicted tenants to their holdings.-Mr. Wyndham (C.) asserted that when in office he issued no instructions contrary to the Act, or to the meaning put upon it when it was discussed. After several speeches, chiefly by Nationalist members, Mr. Bryce replied, justifying his action in the appointment of Sub-Commissioners who, in his opinion, were not partisans. All appointments would be made impartially. The Estates Commissioners&apos; staff would be enlarged, in order to accelerate the progress of the land purchase scheme. The relief of evicted tenants had been retarded by regulations which had been cancelled by the present Govern- ment. The question was not, however, so important as that of the general re- organization of Irish government. He hoped the Commissioners would be able within the lifetime of this Parliament to settle the question. An attempt should be made to provide holdings large enough to enable the people to live in comfort. Tillage would, he thought, yield far better results than grazing farms. The Govt. would do all in their power to make the people owners of their land. May 3. On the vote for the Irish Agricultural Dept., in Supply, Mr. Bryce explained the operations of the Dept. and the working of the Land Acts, and said the Govt. desired to give the former greater powers and larger funds. They would hold an inquiry by Royal Commission, and take action as soon as possible. June 28. Mr. J. Redmond (N.) moved the adjournment to call attention to the failure of the Irish Govt. and the Estates Commissioners to restore the evicted tenants to their homes. He said that upon this depended the peace and tranquillity of Ireland. A Liberal Govt. had been in office for nine months, and the work of restoring the tenants had not quickened, only 86 having been reinstated out of 5,912. The Act of 1903 was blocked by the landlords, who refused to sell untenanted land or to part with the evicted farms in their own hands. At the present rate it would take 50 years to settle this question. Ireland would not tolerate indefinite delay. Mr. T. L. Corbett (C.) said there were many evicted tenants who could not be restored unless their honest law-abiding successors were first dispossessed.—Mr. Bryce asserted that the Act of 1903 had not failed. Great difficulties surrounded the problem of restoration. He wished that public opinion, moderately and temper- ately expressed, could control landlords who put obstacles in the way of the Act. He looked forward to rapid progress in future, and he appealed to owners of property to forget old animosities, and to the Nationalists that there might be no disturbance while the Govt. strove to solve the problem.-Mr. Long (C.) said the Govt. had made a complete surrender to the Nationalists.-The debate stood adjourned. Oct. 29. LICENSING LAWS.-Mr. Sloan (I.) introduced a Bill to enforce Sunday closing in five cities, now exempted, and to close all licensed premises at 9 p.m. on Saturdays. Mr. W. Redmond was the only Nationalist member who spoke in favour of the Bill, which was discussed at great length.-Mr. Bryce said there was a strong case for Sunday closing in Ireland.-The 2nd R. was carried by 244 to 50, and the Bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Trade. May 25. PEACE PRESERVATION ACT.-On the 2nd R. of the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, Mr. Long complained that this Act had been removed sub silentio from the schedule of the measure. Dec. 11. TOWN TENANTS BILL.-A Nationalist Bill which proposed to confer on town tenants a right to compensation for improvements and disturbance came on for 2nd R. It also contained clauses on the principle of leasehold enfranchisement. Landlords&apos; exactions, it was declared, had crushed out enterprise and impeded the growth of towns.-Mr. C. Craig (C.) spoke in opposition, arguing that the compensa- tion clause was not justified, and that the enfranchisement clauses were revolutionary. -Mr. Sloan (I.) supported the Bill.-(An angry altercation occurred between Mr. T. W. Russell and Mr. T. L. Corbett.)-Mr. Cherry (L.), Atty.-Genl. for Ireland, said the principle of compensation for improvements had been in force in Ireland since 1870, &quot; &quot;HOUSE OF COMMONS. 145 McNeill, J. G.

L-Prevention of Corruption Bill.—Lord Halsbury (C.) moved the 2nd R. of this Bill, for the prosecution of corrupt practices by or with agents, subject to consent of the law officer.-Agreed to. Read a third time. March 1. March 8. C-Sir W. Robson (L.), Solr.-Genl., moved the 2nd R.-Mr. Dickinson (L.) opposed on the ground that the condition as to the fiat of the Atty.-Genl. would make it difficult for poor men to enforce their rights.—After debate, the 2nd R. was agreed to, and the Bill was sent to the Standing Committee on Trade. April 3. In the Standing Committee, on Cl. 1, which declares it a misdemeanour for any agent corruptly to accept or obtain any gift or consideration as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do any act in relation to his principal&apos;s affairs or business, or for showing favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal&apos;s affairs or business, Mr. Ridsdale (L.) moved to leave out the word &amp;quot; corruptly,&amp;quot; so that, as he said, the Judge or jury should not have to reproduce a mental photograph of what was passing in the mind of the person taking the money. -Sir L. Walton (L.), Atty. Genl., said the word was necessary for the protection of perfectly innocent persons and acts, such as the sums paid to solicitors, insurance agents, surveyors, or bankers, which were part of their remuneration.-The amendment was negatived by 20 to 9.- Later on an attempt was made to strike out the clause which required the fiat of the Atty.-Genl. before a prosecution can be instituted. It was contended that this require- ment would make the Act a dead letter in many doubtful cases.-The Atty.-Genl. said that the clause was necessary as a safeguard against blackmailing operations. It often happened that persons who had no case whatever were enabled to use the terrible weapon of a threat of exposure, which was highly injurious to commercial men.—The Bill passed through the Committee, June 25, and afterwards became law. -(See STATUTES, post.) C-*Procedure, Rules of.-Mr. Asquith (L.), Chan. of Exchr., moved the appoint- ment of a Committee to consider the question of procedure and to make recommenda- tions. He said that in some respects the recent rules had caused a maximum of inconvenience. The Committee would have before it definite proposals by the Government as to hours of sitting and adjournment, the principle of devolution to committees, and machinery for the allocation of time, so as to abolish the &amp;quot;guillotine.&amp;quot; -Mr. A. Chamberlain (L.U.) asked the Govt. to communicate the main outlines of their scheme at once.--Mr. J. Redmond (N.) advised an autumn sitting, but said that no rules could enable Parliament to transact the business of four local Parliaments and an Imperial Senate.-Motion agreed to. Feb. 28. 66 The A motion to suspend the 12 o&apos;clock rule having been carried (320 to 87), Sir H. C.-Bannerman moved to amend the Standing Orders for the business of the House. He argued first for the restoration of Wednesday morning sittings, as making a break in the middle of the week. At present he said business was sacrificed to week-end worship.&amp;quot;-After discussion, the motion was rejected by 255 to 180.- Sir H. C.-Banner- man then moved that the dinner interval on the first four days of the week be abolished, and that the hour for meeting on those days should be 2.45 p.m. instead of 2. fixed dinner interval had not, he argued, worked satisfactorily, and wasted an hour and a half. Under his proposals there would be no interruption of the sittings, and the gain of an hour and a half would allow the House to meet later and rise earlier. It would be proposed to close contentious business shortly after 11. Questions should be entered upon at 3 o&apos;clock, and closured automatically at 3.45.-Mr. W. Redmond (N.) proposed 3 o&apos;clock as the hour for meeting.—Rejected by 377 to 88.—The Prime Minister&apos;s motion was agreed to.- A motion that on normal occasions sittings should not extend beyond 11.30 p.m. was agreed to; and on a division, a motion that 11 o&apos;clock should be the hour for ending opposed business was carried by 379 to 66; opposed business to end on Fridays at 5 o&apos;clock. April 2. It was agreed that motions for adjournment and unofficial members&apos; motions should come on at 8.15 p.m. It was also agreed to prohibit attempts to count out the House between 8.15 and 9.15. April 3. L-*Public Trustee Bill.-Lord Loreburn (L.), Ld. Chancellor, moved the 2nd R. of a Bill to provide for the safeguarding of estates, especially among the poorer classes, by the appointment of a public trustee and executor.—Lord Halsbury (C.) supported the Bill, which was read a second time. March 27. C-Sir L. Walton (L.), Atty.-Genl., moved the 2nd R.-The_Bill was opposed_by Mr. Radford (L.), Mr. R. Pearce (L.), and Mr. J. M. Henderson (L.), but was agreed to without a division. June 14. The Bill subsequently received the Royal Assent. RAILWAY SERVANTS.-See under LABour. &quot; &quot;PARLIAMENTARY SUMMARY, 1906. 319 C—Fiscal Policy—continued. Sir H. C.-Bannerman stated that it would be open to the Colonial Conference in 1907 to discuss any matter of Imperial interest. March 19. L-Lord Ridley (C.) called attention to the growth of imports from the United Kingdom into Canada under the preferential tariff. March 30. C-Franchise.-Sir C. Dilke (L.) moved the 2nd R. of a Bill for the establishment of a single franchise at all elections and for the removal of the electoral disabilities of women.-The Bill was talked out. March 2. C-Grantham, Mr. Justice.-Mr. MacNeill (N.) moved to go into Committee to consider the election petition for Yarmouth and the complaints which had been made of the conduct of Mr. Justice Grantham during the trial. He alleged that the Judge was biassed by political prejudice.-Mr. Buckmaster (L.) maintained that there was no evidence of corrupt and improper motives.-Sir J. L. Walton (L.), Atty.-Genl., argued against the motion, as not justified by any misconduct involving moral or mental obliquity. He questioned whether the charge of partiality had been established, but he regarded the conduct of Mr. Justice Grantham as most indiscreet.-Mr. Balfour held that there was no proof of conduct amounting to corruption. Nothing could be more transparent than Mr. Justice Grantham&apos;s honesty.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman admitted that the Judge was honest, straightforward, and amiable; but he was an outspoken partisan; and ought not to have sat on an election petition.-The motion, however, would involve his removal, which ought only to follow moral turpitude.- The debate ended with the withdrawal of the motion. HORSES. See under AGRICULTURE. July 6. C-Housing of the Working Classes Bill. Mr. Mackarness (L.) moved the 2nd R.. of a Bill to enable rural district councils to borrow money for housing purposes at cheaper rates and to extend loans over a longer period than was now permitted. It would allow such councils to build labourers&apos; cottages, and to attach to them land up to three acres. A council might be forced to carry out the Act by mandamus. The local authority might obtain land compulsorily.-Mr. Long (C.) questioned the prac- ticability of the measure, and said that the financial difficulty would require the use of the resources of the county area. The landlords as a body had not neglected their duties; but the cost of a labourer&apos;s cottage was about £400, and it gave a return of only 1s. to 2s. a week.-Mr. Burns (Lab.), Pres. Local Govt. Bd., said that time could not be given for passing the Bill, but it might be sent to a Select Committee with a view to action in 1907. He regretted that some local bodies were supine, and required stimulating. The Govt. would do all they could to promote the erection of cottages, and would support the simplification of building by-laws. But the problem was how to obtain land. In many cases landowners desired to live in splendid isolation, and others feared an increase in the poor-rate. Many of the people would be able to spend more money on their homes if they spent less on beer, betting, and attending pro- fessional sports. Much had been heard lately about the physical deterioration of the nation. For his part he believed the matter had been grossly exaggerated; but if by improved housing the nation&apos;s manhood could be strengthened, he, of course, should rejoice. Perhaps rural and urban authorities assisted by the State might ultimately agree to contribute towards a national housing scheme.—The Bill was read a second time, and referred to a Select Committee. April 27. G-India.-PARTITION OF BENGAL,-In the debate on the Address, Mr. H. Roberts (L.) moved an amendment expressing concern at the widespread dissatisfaction and unrest in India due to the policy of the late Govt. and in favour of giving Indian people a larger share in the administration. Mr. Morley (L.), Indian Secy., justified, with reservations, the partition of Bengal, but recognised that it had met with genuine opposition. It was now a settled thing, and the Govt. could not start a fresh policy. India should be given breathing time. As to giving a larger share in the administration to the Indian people, he should adhere to liberal principles, but no change could be brought about by immediate action. The lightening of taxation was one of the master keys of the situation.-Lord Percy (C.) defended the late Govt.&apos;s policy regarding Bengal as called for long ago by circumstances.-Amendment withdrawn. Feb. 26. OPIUM TRAFFIC.—After a short debate, a motion condemning the opium traffic was agreed to. May 30. *FINANCIAL STATEMENT.--Mr. J. Morley (L.), Secy. of State for India, introduced the Indian Budget. He emphasised the immense importance of a wise policy for India, where a false step would result in dire confusion. He deprecated placing the salary of the Secretary of State upon the Estimates, as it would bring Indian affairs into the arena of party politics. The Budget figures were encouraging, as they showed &quot; &quot;522 PRODUCTION AND RAW MATERIALS.

Fowler said this would give the Bd. of Education a veto on the application of the Act, and was impracticable.— Amendment rejected by 336 to 171.-Mr. Maddison (Lab.) proposed that religious in- struction should not be given in transferred schools in school hours or at the public expense. This, he said, would carry out the fundamental principles of full public control and the abolition of tests for teachers. He argued for a purely secular system, and against the use of the Bible as a text-book of theology.-Mr. Lough said he dis- approved the use of Gambetta&apos;s phrase &amp;quot;Clericalism is the enemy,&amp;quot; and deplored it. Religious instruction could not be sufficiently given in the Sunday school or the home. Religious teaching required skilful teachers, and in very many homes religious instruction was not obtainable. Simple Bible reading aud moral lessons were not enough. The Govt. plan was fair for a country which was mainly Protestant.- Mr. Wyndham hoped that this statement meant that the Govt. would make Cl. 4 mandatory so that the rights of minorities might be respected. Mr. Masterman (L.) said the solution of the religious difficulty proposed in the amendment was the right one, and opposed the compromise of the Govt.-Mr. Chamberlain thought that secularism would violate the instincts of an overwhelming majority of the people. Unless religious instruction were given in school hours, great numbers of children would get none, and there would be a sort of endowment of secularism. He himself desired to separate religious from secular education in the State schools; but that children should have moral and religious instruction not at the public expense, but given by the ordinary teachers, if they were willing. He moved to omit from the amendment the words prohibiting religious instruction during school hours. May 23. Mr. R. Macdonald (Lab.) said that simple Bible instruction was not compatible with undenominationalism. If the secular system were rejected Cl. 4 should be made compulsory. Simple Bible teaching would fail to secure genuine religious instruction. The Bill had no stable foundation. Mr. A. Balfour said Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s amendment was an improvement on the original amendment. The Govt. were going to restrict, almost to abolish, the voluntary system, while leaving untouched the Cowper-Temple system. That was grossly unjust. The amendment wished to leave religious in- struction to the Churches and the parents, a large number of whom were not qualified to give it. Such instruction must be given in school and in school hours, as the Sunday schools were not sufficient. Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s scheme was very different, as it con- templated abolishing the Cowper-Temple clause, and substituting a scheme which would satisfy many earnest denominationalists. The best plan would be to give free play to dogmatic denominational teaching of every variety.-Mr. Chamberlain said he never had desired to keep religion out of the schools. The right of entry after school hours would be of no use and could only be a sham.-Mr. Runciman (L.) said that Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s proposal would make the teachers the servants of denominations as well as of the State. That would not work. Mr. Butcher (C.) argued that to divorce religious instruction from secular teaching would cause a loss of moral discipline in the schools. He pleaded for derelict children who would get no religious instruction at all unless in school.-Dr. Macnamara (L.) opposed both amendments.-Mr. B. Law (C.) asserted that, if the Church of England remained irreconcilable, no Govt. could pass the measure into law. The alternative was to follow the Canadian precedent, where the religious problem had been solved by denominational education. May 23. Sir W. Anson opposed the Govt. plan of endowing a special form of religious in- struction, not universally acceptable, out of the rates.-Mr. Birrell repeated that Cowper-Temple teaching would be retained, and that it was in no way hostile to the fuller teaching of religion by the clergy and others. Morality could be no substitute for religion, and Mr. Maddison&apos;s amendment could not be accepted. Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s amendment, in practice, might bring children under sectarian influences of which their parents disapproved. Mr. Balfour denied that it was the function of this Govt. to decide what religion was best for the country, and to put obstacles in the way of any other. If they genuinely desired religious education it should be made obligatory on local authorities to teach religion and to appoint teachers capable of teaching it. The Govt. offered no security for either.-Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s amendment was rejected by 367 to 172 and Mr. Maddison&apos;s by 477 to 63.-Mr. Luttrell (L.) proposed that only schools owned by the local authority should be recognised. He advised Buy or build.&amp;quot;-Mr. Lough pointed out the difficulties of so large a scheme, and the amendment was withdrawn.-Sir W. Anson moved that by-laws should be framed to secure that denominational religious instruction should be given during school hours, in accordance, as far as possible, with the wishes of the parents.—Mr. Lough argued that the amend ment was impracticable.-Mr. Birrell said the syllabuses of the county councils satisfied the great majority of the parents.-Mr. Healy (N.) described Mr. Birrell as advocating 66 &quot; &quot;380 PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS, 1906.

L-Aliens Bill.-Lord Weardale (L.) moved the 2nd R. of a Bill which had passed the other House, and which forbade the landing in this country of an alien if he were brought under contract to take the place of a workman during a trade dispute.-—The rejection was moved by Lord Ridley (C.) who argued that no reasons had been shown for the change.-Lord Beauchamp (L.) declared that the Government would take no part on the one side or the other.-Lord Lansdowne (L.U.) ridiculed this attitude towards a matter of great national importance as undignified. They were trying to knock the bottom out of the Act of 1905, and at the same time to add to it this grotesque proposal. -The Bill was rejected by 96 to 24. May 17. C-In Supply, Mr. J. Ward (Lab.) moved to reduce the vote for a House of Lords&apos; lift, because they had thrown out the Aliens Bill.-After discussion, the amendment was negatived. May 17. On a motion for adjournment, Mr. K. Hardie (Soc.) asked what the Govt. intended to do, and blamed them for not assuming responsibility.-Mr. G. Whiteley (L.) said the rejection of the Bill was a regrettable incident, but it was not a Government Bill. May 17. Mr. J. Ward asked whether the Govt. would reintroduce the Aliens Bill.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman declined, but argued that it was unconstitutional for an Opposition to reject a Bill solely because the Government had not taken it up. (See also under SHIPPING.) May 21. C-Army.-*ARMY ESTIMATES.-Mr. Haldane (L.) Secy. for War, on going into Supply on the Estimates, explained the military policy of the Govt. The enormous expen- diture, he said, had been faced by him as a business man with a view to economy, but any reduction must be gradual, and only £17,000 could be reduced in the coming year. The increased cost, as compared with 1896-7, was accounted for largely by the increase of 14 battalions, increased pay, and the greater cost of the auxiliary forces. As long as we kept so many troops abroad there could be no material reduction of the numbers at home. Parliament did not desire to destroy the Army, but it wanted a more efficient Army at less cost. Before this could be done there must be a clear idea as to the purposes for which the Army existed. He held that the Navy was now able to defend our shores from invasion, and that no foreign Power could land even 5,000 or 10,000 men. This being so, much of the expensive preparation for the defence of London would disappear as soon as possible. The garrison of 100 men at St. Helena would be abolished, and other colonial garrisons could be withdrawn. The native regiment at Wei-hai-wei would also be disbanded. This was the commencement of a policy leading to material economies. Military works by loans would be checked, and the cost put upon the annual votes. The Army ought to be able to respond at any time to a sudden call, and to be increased easily. It was never more efficient than at the present time. It must necessarily be a strictly limited professional Army of high quality, with a very mobile striking force, the size of which must depend upon policy. He wished we were nearing a time when the nations of the world would consider a general reduction of military armaments. We should ask ourselves whether to-day we were menaced in India by Russia, and, if not, whether it was necessary to keep up the present large establishment in India. In case of serious war we should have an interval in which to prepare supports for the striking force. He suggested two periods of training for these troops, the first elementary and the second such as would fit them for service. Many more men might learn voluntarily the elements of training, and volunteers, cadet corps, rifle clubs, etc., should be encouraged to qualify to assîst the Regular Army abroad. Such a scheme must be associated with local government. The manhood of the country should form an organization &amp;quot;in skeleton&amp;quot; which could be clothed with flesh in time of war. No Government would then enter upon a war unless the people were behind it. Such ideas, however, could not be carried out for a long time. The Militia was not in a satisfactory position. As to labour questions, he proposed an interchange of views between the officials and the great labour organiza- tions. University education for officers should be encouraged, and steps taken to improve the lot of the average officer. By 31st May two army corps would be armed with the new field guns and great progress was being made with the supply of the short rifle. If the example of citizen service set by the mother country were followed by the Colonies millions of men would be available and peace would be ensured for many a year to come.-Mr. Arnold-Forster (L.U.) expressed pleasure at hearing that there was to be no present change in Army policy, and that the Army had never been in a more efficient state. He agreed with the principles laid down, but questioned the value of vast crowds of semi-trained, semi-organized troops in time of war.-Mr. Wyndham (C.) opposed the view that the Indian garrison could be reduced, and any large reduction in the force at Gibraltar and Malta-Mr. R. Macdonald (Lab.) moved an amendment that the conditions of labour in arsenals should be equal to those in &quot; &quot;542 JISK859 1128 A.219725 80/1/1.7. &quot; &quot;90 HOUSE OF LORDS.

C. &quot; &apos;LOCAL GOVERNMENT.-COUNTY COUNCILS-continued. 269 The occupation of part of a house qualifies where that part is separately occupied for the purposes of any trade, business or profession. Where a person succeeds to qualifying property by descent, marriage, etc., the occupation and rating of the predecessor in title qualifies the successor. If a person has occupied different property in the County in immediate succession during the twelve months, he is entitled to be registered in the parish in which the last-occupied qualification is situated. N.B.-Non-resident owners and lodgers are not entitled to vote in the election of County Councils, nor are electors under the Service Franchise. LONDON.-All persons on any Parliamentary or Parochial list are entitled to vote at a County Council election; this includes registered property owners, householders, lodgers, and service voters. RESIDENCE. A County Elector must have resided in the County, or within 7 (in the case of London, 15) miles of its boundary, for twelve months prior to July 15th (or in the case of the £10 qualification, six months). He or she may, however, let the house furnished, for not more than four months during the year, without losing the vote. RATING. The elector, or someone else, must, during the twelve months prior to July 15th, have been rated in respect of the qualifying property to all poor rates made during those twelve months; and all such rates (including County rates) as have become payable up to the preceding 5th January must be paid on or before July 20th. QUALIFICATION OF COUNCILLORS. The qualification of County Councillors is thus defined by the Municipal Corpora- tions Act, 1882, as extended to Counties:- :- The Councillors are to be fit (i.e., legally qualified) persons chosen by the County electors. A person is not qualified to be elected, or to be a County Councillor, unless he (a) Is enrolled, and entitled to be enrolled, as a County elector. (b) Being entitled to be so enrolled in all respects except that of residence, is resident beyond 7 miles, but within 15 miles of the county, and is en ered in the separate non-resident list. (c) In either of those cases is possessed of real or personal property to the value, in the county, of £1,000; or is rated to the poor rate in the county on the annual (rateable) value of £30. &quot;Provided that every person shall be qualified to be elected, and to be a County Councillor, who is at the time of election qualified to elect to the office of Councillor, which last-mentioned qualification for being elected shall be alternative for, and shall not repeal or take away any other qualification &quot;But if a person qualified under the last foregoing proviso ceases for twelve months to reside in the county, he shall cease to be qualified under that proviso, and his office shall become vacant, unless he was at the time of his election, and continues to be, qualified in some other manner. The practical effect of these provisions is that any person who is properly enrolled as a County elector may be elected a Councillor for that county, and need not in that case be qualified for election by property or rating. Persons who are on the separate non-resident list, residing beyond 7 but within 15 miles of the county, must be qualified by the stated amount of property or rating. The Local Government Act further provides that peers owning property in the county, and other owners of property in the county who are registe ed as Parlia- mentary county electors, shall be qualified to be elected County Councillors. Clerks in holy orders, and other ministers of religion, may also be elected, if duly qualified. Disqualifications for Election.-Persons holding any office of profit in the gift or disposal of the Council, or any share or interest in any contract or employment with, by or on behalf of the Council. Bankrupts, persons convicted of felony, or corrupt practices. Coroners for the County. Women, though qualified to elect, are dis- qualified for election. THE ELECTIONS. The poll at contested elections for the County Council is conducted by ballot, as at Parliamentary elections. No elector can vote more than once at any election for the same county, even though he may be on the register for more than one electoral division. (In London any elector may vote for one or both candidates, but may not give his two votes to one candidate.) The elections for all the divisions of a county are held on the same day, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. &apos; &quot;294 PARLIAMENTARY SUMMARY, 1906. L-Army-*ARMY ESTIMATES-continued. and of the people. He justified the proposed reductions.--Lord Tweedmouth (L.) argued that the artillery would not be weakened. In condemning conscription, he said there was no comparison between the position of this country and Continental nations.-Lord Goschen (C.) said they had not been told how increased efficiency was to be secured. July 24. Nov. 26. Lord Monkswell called attention to the question of the civil employment of ex-soldiers and sailors, and an interesting discussion ensued. C-A discussion took place on the discharge of invalids from Netley Hospital.- Mr. T. L. Corbett (C.) moved the adjournment in order to call attention to the subject. —Mr. Haldane defended his action in the matter.--Motion negatived by 259 to 61. Nov. 8. C-Beer Bill. Mr Courthope (L.) moved the 2nd R. of a Bill to compel licence- holders to supply beer brewed from barley malt and to prevent the sale of deleterious beer. Mr. McKenna (L.), for the Govt., opposed the Bill as unworkable, as it was not possible by chemical analysis to decide whether beer had been brewed from barley malt and hops or from substitutes.-The Bill was rejected by 164 to 109. March 16. C-Betting Bill.-Leave was refused to Mr. Bottomley (L.) to introduce a Bill to prohibit street betting, and to provide that bookmakers should be licensed. April 3. The Street Betting Bill was re-introduced and became law. (See STATUTES, post.) C-*Business of the House.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman moved that until the adjourn- ment of the House for the summer recess Govt. business should continue on Fridays at 5 o&apos;clock and on other days at 11. The Govt. proposed to carry over the Plural Voting Bill, the Merchant Shipping Bill, and the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Bill to the autumn, and to make progress with other Bills, which he named.—Mr. Balfour protested against suspending the Standing Orders to proceed with so controversial a Bill as the Trade Disputes Bill after 11 p.m. He asked for time for discussing the Army reforms.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman said the Report and 3rd R. of the Trade Bill would be deferred until the autumn.-The motion was agreed to. July 13. Sir H. C.-Bannerman proposed a motion to enable the House to sit until any hour in order to expedite the passage of the Bills with which the Govt. intended to proceed. He mentioned among these the Education (Provision of Meals) Bill, the Licensing (Removal of Doubts) Bill, the Burials Bill, the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Bill, the Recorders, Stipendiary Magistrates and Clerks of the Peace Bill, the Telegraph Construction Bill, the Public Trustee Bill, the Census of Production Bill, the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Bill, the Street Betting Bill, and others. Mr. Balfour criticised the Govt.&apos;s methods of conducting business, and blamed them for the use which they had made of the autumn sittings in order to pass a horde of miscellaneous Bills.-Mr. Asquith said it was the duty of a new Govt. and a new Parliament to create precedents.-Motion agreed to. Dec. 7. CATTLE IMPORTATION.-See under AGRICULTURE. C-Census of Production Bill.-This Bill was considered in Committee and a number of amendments were briefly discussed.-The Bill was read a third time. Dec. 14. It subsequently passed into law. L-China. Lord Fitzmaurice (L.), Under Secy., stated that a Chinese Imperial Edict was issued placing all Chinese and foreigners in the Customs under the control of the President of the Board of Revenue. H.M. Govt. asked for an explanation as to the position and powers of Sir R. Hart, and the Chinese Govt. had disclaimed any intention of not adhering to their engagements. H.M. Govt. insisted that there should be no change in the present administration, and were acting in harmony with the other Powers. Lord Lansdowne hoped that the Govt., having put their foot down, would keep it down. May 28. COLONIAL MARRIAGES BILL.-See under MARRIAGE LAW. L-*Criminal Appeal Bill.—Lord Loreburn (L.), Ld. Chancellor, moved the 2nd R. of a Bill to give a convicted person an unrestricted right of appeal on all points to a Court of Criminal Appeal, and not only as at present on a point of law reserved by the Judge. The Court of Appeal would consist of three Judges of the High Court, and they would not interfere with the prerogative of mercy.-Lord Cross (C.) and Lord Halsbury (C.) considered the Bill too wide, and as likely to lead to appeals all over the country, and interfere with the administration of justice.-Lord James (L.U.) sup- ported the Bill, which, after some remarks, was read a second time. March 27. On the motion to go into Committee, Lord Alverstone, Ld. Ch. Justice, asked for further explanation. He was not opposed to a Court of Appeal within certain limits; but this Bill created a very great danger for the innocent man, by undermining the responsibility of juries. It contained quite a new principle, &quot; &quot;POLITICAL NOTES. 401 THE EDUCATION BILL, 1906-continued. [AS IT LEFT THE COMMONS. TA AS IT LEFT THE LORDS. (2) The Commission may, if they think fit, in any case where their decision appears to them to involve a substantial question of law of general importance, give leave, on the application of the local education authority or the owners of the schoolhouse, to appeal from that decision, in manner provided by Rules of Court, to the Court of Appeal, whose decision shall be final, but, subject to this pro- vision, no Court shall have power to review or interfere in any way with the schemes, orders, decisions or other proceedings of the Commission, or of the Board of Education on the con⚫ sideration of any application to vary or cancel an order made by the Commission, and the Commission shall, amongst other matters, have power, for the purpose of their powers and duties under this Act, to decide whether a schoolhouse or any interest therein is held under charitable trusts or not. (3) Where an order is made by the Commission with respect to the use of a schoolhouse by the local education authority, the conditions set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) and the provisions of subsections (2), (3), and (5) of section two of this Act shall apply as they apply in the case of an arrangement made under that section. Appeals as to the mode in which Extended Facilities are afforded. 13. The parents of at least twenty children attending a transferred voluntary school, or the parents committee, if aggrieved by the mode in which extended facilities are afforded by a local education authority, may appeal to the Board of Education, and that Board, if satisfied, after considering the circumstances of the case, that there are reasonable grounds for the appeal, may make an order prescribing the mode in which extended facilities shall be carried out. Provisions as to State-aided Schools. 14.-(1) If the Commission think fit after consulting the Board of Education, they may, in the case of any existing or transferred voluntary school which fulfils the conditions requisite before extended facilities can be granted under this Act, make an order continuing such school as a state-aided school- (a) if the applicants for the facilities desire that instead of the facilities being granted such an order should be made; or (b) if the parents&apos; committee complain of the mode in which extended &quot; &quot;CONSTITUENCIES AND ELECTIONS. 209 Dundee continued. 1900.

C-Army-*ARMY ESTIMATES-continued. standard, and definite functions assigned to it.-Mr. Arnold-Forster said that some of the economies already effected had been partially anticipated. He did not believe in the possibility of continuing the linked battalion system. The depôt system was far preferable.-The closure having been carried (222 to 36), the vote was agreed to. March 19. On the vote for the Army Medical Establishment, Mr. Haldane said that an Army Medical Reserve would be formed composed of young medical men, who would receive retaining fees and serve for seven years.-Vote agreed to.-Upon the vote for the pay of the Militia, Mr. Arnold-Forster asked that the functions of the force should be clearly defined. They were not at present fit to take the field.-Mr. Haldane said the country could not afford to disregard the traditions of the Militia ; the service was not in a satisfactory position, and that there were many inefficient battalions. The Militia must be supplemented, and must be placed on the Regular side of the national Army, and not be merely a reserve for the Line battalions, but regiments in the fullest sense of the word, and conforming to a standard which was not now reached. To effect this a great deal of drastic reform might be necessary. He endorsed the views of those who held that Lords-lieutenant and deputy-lieutenants must have real duties assigned to them in connection with the Militia. The vote was agreed to, and also the vote for the Yeomanry. March 27. Major Seely (L.) moved a resolution condemning the present system of recruiting, as providing for the infantry large numbers of men who could not become efficient soldiers.-Mr. Arnold-Forster (L.U.) admitted that the quality of the recruits was not always satisfactory, and suggested various remedies to make life in the Army more attractive. The key of the problem was the employment after discharge. Mr. Haldane said that a good deal was being done in that direction. He admitted a falling-off in the infantry, but he hoped it soon would revert to the normal level. There was great difficulty in maintaining a long-service Army and in obtaining men for it. The motion went too far.-It was eventually talked out. May 2. L-Lord Wemyss (C.) called attention to the question of home defence and of com- pulsory service in the Militia.-Lord Portsmouth stated that the Government had a mobilization scheme ready, and one for the defence of ports against any sudden attack. They would not support compulsory service for the Militia, but desired to raise the status and position of the force. The Volunteers were the main strength for home defence. May 14. Lord Portsmouth stated that the Govt. would discontinue contributing towards the cost of the construction of Volunteer rifle ranges out of loan funds during the present year. May 28. C-ESTIMATES.-The votes for transports, remounts, supplies and clothing, ordnance establishments, barracks, works and buildings were considered.-Major Evans-Gordon (C) moved to reduce the latter vote.-Mr. Paul (L.) criticised the appointment of Mr. Milvain to the office of Judge Advocate-General.-Mr. Haldane defended the ap- pointment, and declared Mr. Milvain to be a most competent man.-An amendment to reduce the vote was rejected by 110 to 27. June 7. L-Lord Roberts called attention to the unpreparedness of the nation for war and to the necessity for action being taken in accordance with the recommendation of the Elgin Commission. He said the lessons of the late war seemed to have been forgotten, and the danger of unpreparedness was not recognised. Surely the defence of the Empire ought to take precedence over every other question. He strongly impressed on the House the necessity of being prepared for any great national emergency by having a sufficient number of trained soldiers. He, therefore, advocated a strong Reserve.- Lord Portsmouth said the Govt. had by no means neglected the territorial Army; but they demurred to Lord Roberts&apos; suggestion that every man of military age should, compulsorily, be trained. This would be admitting the principle of conscription, to which this industrial country would never submit.-Lord Milner (L.U.) argued against setting up the bogey of conscription. It was a primary duty of citizenship to defend the Empire, and the citizen should be trained. They should have a large body of men trained to arms-willing and competent to fight; and compulsory service was accepted by great and free European nations.-Lord Lansdowne denied that con- scription was involved; but we could not rely on the Navy alone and neglect the land forces. The dearth of officers was a most formidable difficulty. July 10. C-Mr. Haldane described the Govt. scheme for Army reduction and re- organization. He said at the outset that in cost and organization the state of the national Forces was highly unsatisfactory. If confidence were to be placed in the Army the public must feel that it got value for its money. The Govt. meant to give a lead to other countries in reducing armaments.

W.) is presided over by the Lord Warden of the Stannaries and a Council; it is charged with the management of the estates be- longing to the Prince of Wales as Duke of Cornwall. The jurisdiction and powers of the Stannaries Court were transferred to the County Courts of Cornwall in 1896. LORD WARDEN.-Earl of Ducie. SEC.--Sir M. Holzmann, K.C.V.O., C.B., I.S.O. both COURTS OF JUSTICE, THE ROYAL (Strand, W. C.)-The Courts of Justice, though not, strictly speaking, part of the Executive Government, are now maintained out of the Imperial funds, and may properly be noticed here. The Supreme Court of Judicature for England was constituted by the Act 37 and 38 Vict., cap. 66. It consists of two permanent divisions, His Majesty&apos;s High Court of Justice,&amp;quot; with original and appellate jurisdiction, and &amp;quot;His Majesty&apos;s Court of Appeal,&amp;quot; mainly exercising appellate jurisdiction. The High Court of Justice is divided into three divisions, and now consist of (1) The Lord Chancellor and six Justices of the Chancery Division, (2) The Lord Chief Justice of England, and fourteen Justices of the King&apos;s Bench Division, and (3) the President and one Justice of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division. The Court of Appeal consists of four ex-officio Judges, viz., the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice of England, the Master of the Rolls, the President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division; and five Lords Justices of Appeal, who are all Privy Councillors. The various offices of the Courts were amalgamated in 1879 and a &amp;quot;Central Office&amp;quot; was constituted, under the superintendence of the Masters of the Supreme Court, now seven in number. In its various departments is transacted the general business of litigation leading up to the hearing of cases in Court, includ- ing the machinery for recording the Orders of the Courts. The six Chancery Judges, working in pairs, have, in addition, sets of Chambers, and four Chancery Masters are assigned to each pair for dealing with questions affecting property, &amp;amp;c., over which the Chancery Division has jurisdiction. There are also eleven Taxing Masters, whose duties are to tax the costs of solicitors. The salaries of all the officers of the Courts are defrayed from moneys voted by Parlia- ment, with the exception of the Judges, whose salaries are charged upon the Consolidated Fund. master-General, post.)

After the voices have been given, he declares whether, in his opinion, the &amp;quot;ayes&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot; noes &amp;quot;have it.&amp;quot; If his decision is challenged, he directs the &amp;quot;ayes&amp;quot; to go into the right lobby, and the &amp;quot;noes into the left lobby, and appoints two tellers for each party. When all the members have resumed their places, the tellers on either side come to the table and report the numbers to the Speaker, who declares them to the House. If he is of opinion that a division is frivolously or vexatiously claimed, he may take the vote by calling upon the members who support and who challenge his decision, to rise in their places. and he shall then either declare the numbers or name tellers for a division. Public Bills.-A member who wants to initiate a Bill must attend at the begin- ning of business on the first day of a Session, and must ballot for a place for his notice. On his position in the ballot, early or late, very much depends the chance of pushing the Bill through Par- liament. The ballot can be drawn by one member for another, and groups of members sometimes ballot individually for the same Bill, thus securing addi- tional chances of success. Bills making grants of public money must originate with Ministers, and must be first con- sidered in Committee of the whole House. The first reading of a Bill may be taken immediately after the same has been presented. On the order being read for the second reading of a Bill, a notion is made, and a question put, &amp;quot;That the Bill be now read a second time,&amp;quot; and amendments may be moved by leaving out &amp;quot;now,&amp;quot; and substituting &amp;quot;three months,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;six months,&amp;quot; or any other time; or that the Bill be rejected. Bill having been read a second time, is ordered to be committed to a Committee of the whole House, or, in certain cases, to a Select Committee, or to a Standing Committee. The Bill having been fully considered in Committee, the Chairman is directed to report it to the House. Clauses may be withdrawn by the mem- ber in charge of the Bill on giving two days&apos; notice. A Bill reported without amendment is ordered to be read a third time, and on the third reading a motion is made and question put, that the Bill be now read a third time, to which amendments may be moved, as on the second reading. After the third reading, and further proceedings thereon, the title of the Bill is agreed to, and the Bill is 66 A passed without further question. For a description of the various Committees of the House of Commons see &amp;quot;Glossary of political terms,&amp;quot; post. Supply.-Whenever the Committee of Supply stands as an Order of the day, the Speaker leaves the Chair without putting any question, unless on first going into Supply on the army. navy, or civil service estimates respectively, or on a vote of credit, an amendment is moved, or question raised, relating to the estimates proposed to be taken in Supply. In 1896, for the first time, a Sessional Order was passed allotting twenty days, before the 5th August, to the business of Supply, with an addi- tional three days, if necessary, before or after the same date. If the business is not completed within that time the re- maining votes are to be decided upon in classes forthwith. Supplementary esti- mates and votes of credit are excluded from the computation, and the proceed- ings are not to be interrupted by motions for adjournment or other dilatory motions. The success of this experiment in pro- viding for the regular and business-like discussion of the Estimates has been very marked, and the Sessional Order has since been annually renewed, with some variations. Partly considered Bills.-In the Session of 1890, owing to the excessive length of the debates, Lord Salisbury&apos;s Government brought forward proposals by which power would be given to the House of Commons to carry over Bilis from one session to another. A Committee was appointed, and the Government proposals were met by Mr. Gladstone with a direct negative, but his draft report framed in that sense was rejected. The Report of the Committee stated that the exhausting labours imposed upon members of Parliament were excessive and increasing, and that the closure was inadequate to enable the House to deal with lengthy, complicated, and contro- versial Bills. It was necessary, therefore, either to adopt a more stringent form of closure or revive to give power to measures in the succeeding session. They recommended the second alterna- tive. They proposed that- &amp;quot;A Standing Order should be passed, under which any Public Bill, in pro- gress in Committee of the whole House, or in a Standing Committee, or which had been reported, or which had reached any further stage, might, on the motion of a member in charge of the Bill, be suspended until the next Session. &amp;quot;If the Motion were carried, then, in the ensuing Session of the same Parlia- ment, a Member whose name was on &quot; &quot;46 CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST ADMINISTRATIONS-continued.

If a local authority refused to take over a school after such an Order had been made, they could be compelled by mandamus. No rent would be paid for schools having extended facilities, so that the element of bargaining and haggling would be excised. There would be a ballot of parents to make sure that their wishes had been properly ascertained. Children would not be allowed to be moved from one school to another to set up title to extended facilities. The Govt. hoped that interference with the discretion of the local authorities would in practice be very small.-Lord E. Talbot (C.) expressed surprise and disappointment at the proposal. The present clause would destroy half the Roman Catholic schools, and their new proposals meant starvation to many schools. That no rent should be paid almost constituted a breach of faith.- Mr. A. Lyttelton (L.U.) said the amendments would weaken the clause. Many Noncon- formists prefer to go to prison rather than pay a rate for a Catholic school.-Dr. Macnamara (L.) expressed amazement at the new plan of the Govt., which violated the principle of Cl. 1, and would be disastrous to educational efficiency.-Mr. Cham- berlain said it was evident that the Bill was drawn on wrong lines, and afforded no lasting settlement. The clause in any case would be a sham. The only solution was the separation of religious from secular instruction. Mr. Balfour said Mr. Birrell&apos;s new plan would impose too onerous a burden on the Board, and was in no way necessary. It would be far better to make the clause mandatory. The Govt. were tempting local authorities to abstain from granting&amp;quot; facilities,&amp;quot; and trying to force the voluntary schools to forego rate-aid. The scheme was most reactionary and unjust. June 25. Mr. Birrell defended his proposals and said he was determined to adhere to the clause. He declined to make it mandatory, and an appeal to the Board of Education would be far simpler than to the courts. This procedure would be more facile than any other; but in the last resort the Board could have recourse to mandamus.—Mr. J. Redmond said the clause was inadequate for safeguarding Roman Catholic schools. It ought to be made obligatory and the population limit of 5,000 should be reduced. No obscure local authority ought to be able to defy the decision of the House that religion should be taught and that denominational facilities should be given. Mr. Birrell&apos;s amendment involved, not contracting out, but being kicked out. He con- demned the no rent&amp;quot; proposal.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman said the Opposition offered the alternative of State-provided secular teaching with a right of entry for all denomina- tions. What would become of the &amp;quot; atmosphere&amp;quot; of the Catholic schools in such case? The Govt. held that the common principles of Christianity should be taught in the schools, and intended to stand by Cl. 4.-Mr. Balfour said it was evident that the deep feeling against the Bill in the Church of England had not been recognised. Cl. 4 violated the consciences of Nonconformists, and at the same time did not satisfy denominationalists. It left the Church of England, the Church of Rome, and the Jews with a grievance wholly unredressed and the grievance of the passive resister just where it was.-The amendment was rejected by 340 to 103.-Mr. Cave (C.) moved to extend the clause to transferred voluntary schools in all rural districts where there were alternative schools.-Mr. Birrell admitted a difference between the conditions of town life and country life, and said that in the country there might often be no real choice of schools.-Mr. Balfour asserted that the Govt. had deliberately intended by this Bill to aim a blow at the Anglican schools. Only 9 per cent. of Roman Catholic children would be excluded from the clause, and the number of Anglican children excluded would be far greater.-Amendment negatived by 344 to 186. June 26. The Clause was further debated and amendments disposed of. June 27. Cl. 6 was discussed, and an amendment by Mr. Walters (L.) to compel attendance throughout the school hours, including religious instruction, was rejected by 283 to 267. The clause was carried. 66 July 2. On Cl. 7 (teachers not to give denominational instruction in transferred schools), Mr. Hicks-Beach (C.) moved its omission, and a long debate ensued, resulting in the rejection of the amendment (under closure) by 416 to 118.-The clause was afterwards carried. July 3. On Cl. 8, the names of the Commissioners to be appointed were announced, viz. Sir Arthur Wilson, Sir Hugh Owen, and Mr. Worsley-Taylor, K.C. They would, Mr. Birrell said, have to decide in law and equity whether a school in order to carry out the trust ought to be transferred to the local authority.-Mr. Balfour expressed approval of the personnel of the Commission.-An alternative amendment was negatived by 306 to 167.—Mr. Cave proposed to give trustees of a school the right to apply under the clause to the Commissioners.-Mr. Birrell argued that it would impose upon the Commissioners work which they ought not to be asked to perform.-Rejected by 247 to 109.-Sir W. Anson moved to define the purposes for which a schoolhouse under trust could be used by the local authority.—Rejected by a majority of 159.- Closure carried by 320 to 151, July 4 &quot; &quot;xiii.

L.. &quot; &quot;PARLIAMENTARY SUMMARY, 1906. 285 L-Africa, South-TRANSVAAL AND ORANGE RIVER COLONY-continued. reminded the House that the enemies of this country, beaten in war, rejoiced at the abuse which had been heaped on Lord Milner. The only one that stood up for him was Lord Elgin. When Lord Milner went out the Transvaal was armed to the teeth, was working hard to abolish the authority of the paramount Power, and was negotiating with Germany. He hoped the House would show that England was not going to repeat the mistakes of 1881-82, but that she would stand by those who had been loyal to her in the war. The only charge against Lord Milner was that on one occasion he gave permission for the caning of the Chinese. He did not recollect having given this permission, but he had chivalrously accepted the responsibility.-Lord Elgin moved the previous question. He said he would be the last to act ungenerously towards Lord Milner, who had done his work admirably-work which must leave its imprint for good or evil on the face of history. But the Govt. felt that it was impossible to discuss the motion without entering into the policy of the late Govt. and its consequences. He declined to join in that discussion as it would raise obstacles to progress and peace in S. Africa.-Lord Cawdor (C.) said the issue was a plain one and the Govt. ought not to evade it.-The Abp. of Canterbury said he always deprecated votes of this kind, but should vote for it. He distrusted Chinese labour from the first. One mistake should not cancel Lord Milner&apos;s claims to his country&apos;s gratitude. Lord Goschen (C.) said that the blow struck at Lord Milner in the H. of Commons had caused great indignation throughout the country. The present motion was as a matter of mere justice, and it would show the loyalists of S. Africa that this country would stand by them.-Earl Roberts bore testimony to the great services of Lord Milner in guarding the national honour in S. Africa. The ordeal would have broken down many men, but all was apparently to be forgotten, and Lord Milner censured by the new Govt., to the alarm and anxiety of the loyalists.—Lord Halsbury (C.) severely condemned the treatment which Lord Milner had received from the Govt. side, and that he had been grievously injured by calumny; he had rendered great services to the State in different parts of the Empire, and one item had been magnified into a tremendous accusation.-Lord Londonderry (C.) complained that no member of the Govt. had protested against the attack by Mr. Churchill.-Lord Ripon (L.), Ld. Privy Seal, said that the motion would stir up angry and bitter feelings in S. Africa and render the duties of Lord Elgin more difficult. Lord Milner&apos;s services had been rewarded by a peerage.-Lord Lansdowne (L.U.) considered that the case in favour of the motion overwhelming, as few public servants had deserved better of his country. One thing only was alleged against Lord Milner, and there was a doubt as to his responsibility, though he had accepted it most chivalrously. Exasperation was already caused by the vote in the House of Commons, and this motion was the complement. In honouring Lord Milner they were correctly interpreting the feelings of the great majority of the people. Lord Halifax&apos;s resolution was carried by 170 to 35. Mar. 29. C-In Committee of Supply on the Colonial Vote, Mr. Arnold-Forster (L.U.) called attention to Mr. Churchill&apos;s conduct of the business of his Department, in having several times used expressions which had deeply wounded the feelings of our Colonial fellow-subjects. He suggested that it would be a good thing to transfer hin to some other department.-Mr. Belloc (L.) complained that the Govt. which had been returned to power to put an end to coolie labour had not done so.-After other speeches, Mr. Wyndham said the Unionist party wanted to know what was the precise attitude of the Govt. in regard to the Constitutions for the new Colonies, and on the native question and the economic question. If they reserved a right of interference, after self-government had been granted, a dangerous state of affairs would be brought about. The white population lived in constant dread of outbreaks on the part of the natives. As to the economic question, it was necessary to secure a good output of gold if the country were to be developed. The Govt. owed the House a plain statement.- Mr. Churchill declined to answer all the points raised on the ground that he was not an encyclopædia. The representative system proposed by Mr. Lyttelton would have been unworkable, and therefore the Govt. had determined to go forward and to proceed at once to the establishment of a responsible Legislative Assembly, with an Executive. The voting power should as far as possible be distributed evenly, and in order to obtain full information on all points the Govt. were sending out a committee which would inquire into the constitution of a possible Second Chamber, the means of safeguarding native interests, the way to secure the due representation of labour, the land settlement, and the details of the Constitution for the Orange River Colony, where there would be a Dutch majority. They desired that British supremacy should be maintained, with the co-operation of the Dutch as well as of the British. April 5. → Mr. Churchill announced the terms of a proclamation to be issued to the Chinese labourers in the mines in regard to the repatriation of discontented coolies and the &quot; &quot;IMPORTS AND EXPORTS-continued. 515 Trade with certain Foreign Countries and British Possessions-continued.

C-Education-*EDUCATION BILL-continued. moved and defeated by large majorities, and at 10.30 p.m. the guillotine came into play, and several Govt. amendments were carried: finally the Bill went forward for 3rd Reading. &amp;quot;&amp;quot; 66 July 25. On the order for the 3rd R., Mr. W. Long (C.) moved the rejection of the Bill, con- tending that it was cruelly oppressive and unjust to Church of England schools, and that it pleased nobody. Its machinery was cumbrous, and injurious to local adminis- tration. It showed signs of hasty preparation and was in great part obscure.-Mr. Asquith maintained that the principles of the measure were thoroughly understood. Every public elementary school would be under the exclusive management and control of representative authorities. No teacher would be required to give religious teaching or to belong to any religious communion. Except in the four-fifths schools, the only religious instruction would be simple religious instruction, subject to the conscience clause. This was the only practicable solution of the problem. He admitted, of course, that there were two gaps in the scheme: an owner might refuse to transfer his school, and there might be a perverse local authority which would insist on building a new school at the cost of the ratepayers. But he did not view these contingencies as practical. The &amp;quot;extended facilities clause need not alarm Nonconformists, as adequate safeguards had been provided. The Welsh Council clause had been modified to conciliate the Opposition, and was not a step in the direction of Home Rule.-Mr. J. Redmond, for the Nationalist party, said they could not vote for the 3rd R., as the Bill would condemn half the schools of the Roman Catholics to starvation. --Mr. Belloc (L.) also declared that no one who wished to maintain the Catholic schools could possibly vote for the measure.- .-Mr. Paul (L.) denied that in all cases what the parents wished should be taught.—Mr. Masterman (L.) complained that a Govt, calling itself Liberal should propose a special kind of State-subsidized religious teaching.-Mr. Perks (L.) said it would not break his heart if the Bill did not pass.-Dr. Macnamara said that all the difficulties had arisen from the fact that the Govt. had endeavoured to meet the denominations fairly and generously.-Mr. Balfour said that the Oppo- sition were as hostile to the Bill as ever, as it was not based on justice and equality; and he contended that, as far as the grievances of Nonconformist teachers and children were concerned, his Act of 1902 was a marked improvement on the settlement of 1870. Time after time, they had been told by the Govt. that when the Bill had become law things would be very much as they were before. If that was to be the case, how would the Bill remedy any Nonconformist grievance? Then as to the passive resister-how would he be affected? The complaint was that the passive resister was compelled to pay rates for denominational teaching. Under Cls. 3 and 4 the grievances of the passive resisters would remain, as the schools in which special religious instruction would be given would be supported out of the rates. To the Church of England the measure was grossly unfair, and even its sup- porters did not like it, and hoped it would be amended by the House of Lords. Mr. Birrell repudiated the charge that the Bill showed a spirit of hostility to the Church of England. It would secure for every Nonconformist in every village of the country an undenominational school. It redressed the teacher&apos;s grievance and set his con- science free. The main object of the Govt. was to secure that religious education ´should be given throughout the country by making teaching of the kind authorized by the Act of 1870 the ordinary rule. Board-school instruction had never conflicted with the religion of the Church of England, and the Bill would strengthen the Church and make it more popular in country districts.-The 3rd R. was carried by 369 to 177. July 30. -Lord Crewe moved the 2nd R. of the Bill. He said that by the Act of 1902, voluntary schools for the first time applied for and obtained rate aid, and that effected a great change and one which could not be permanent, as it gave an unfair advantage to the Established Church. Inasmuch as the country rejected purely secular teaching, and there were overwhelming difficulties in giving religious teaching to all the different sects at the same time, the Govt. fell back on the scheme of the Bill, which aimed at founding a national system of education as far as possible. It would place an undenominational school within the reach of every parent of every child who desired it, and thus removed the principal grievance of Nonconformists. The religious instruction given in the county schools, under the Cowper-Temple clause, met the wishes of the vast majority of parents, and special facilities for religious teaching were given in schools where it was desired on certain days.-Lord Londonderry (C.) agreed that the public were in favour of popular control, but the Bill would endow Nonconformity at the expense of the whole community. Cl. 4 aimed at conciliating Roman Catholic Nationalist supporters and cutting out the Church of England. He hoped the Bill would be thoroughly and searchingly &quot; &apos;121 FAMILY NAMES OF PEERS (WHEN DIFFERING FROM THEIR TITLES). Abbot-L. Colchester Abbott-L.

L-King&apos;s Speech-continued. to the initiative of the President of the United States, which resulted in an honourable peace. 66 An agreement has been concluded with the Government of the Emperor of Japan prolonging and extending that which was made between the two Governments in January, 1902. Its text has already been made public. 60 The Conference summoned by the Sultan of Morocco to consider the introduction of reforms into his Kingdom has assembled at Algeciras, and delegates from the Powers Signatories of the Madrid Convention of 1880 are engaged in deliberations, which still continue. It is earnestly to be hoped that the result of these negotiations may be conducive to the maintenance of peace among all nations. “The dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway has been peacefully accomplished, and, in accordance with the declared desire of the Norwegian people, my son-in-law and daughter, the Prince and Princess Charles of Denmark, have ascended the throne of Norway as King and Queen. “The insurrectionary movement in Crete has subsided, and the four Protecting Powers have appointed Commissioners with a view to the introduction of reforms in the island. &amp;quot;The condition of the Macedonian vilayets, though in some respects improved, continues e cause for anxiety. The Sultan has agreed to the appointment of an International Financial Commission to supervise the financial administration of these provinces, and I trust that this may lead to the introduction of salutary reforms and the improvement of the condition of the population. 136 Papers will be laid before you respecting Army administration in India. &amp;quot;In order to establish Responsible Government in the Transvaal Colony, I have decided to recall the Letters Patent which provided for the intermediate stage of Representative Government, and to direct that the new Constitution be drawn up with as much expedition as is consistent with due care and deliberation in all particulars. The elections to the first Legislative Assembly, which had been expected in July, must accordingly be postponed, but it is not anticipated that the additional delay need extend beyond a few months. &amp;quot;The directions which have been given that no further licences should be issued for the importation of Chinese coolies will continue in force during that period. 66 A Constitution granting Responsible Government will also be framed for the Orange River Colony. 66 &apos;It is my earnest hope that in these Colonies, as elsewhere throughout my dominions, the grant of free institutions will be followed by an increase of prosperity and of loyalty to the Empire. 66 The Colonial Conference, which in existing circumstances cannot be held this year, has been postponed until the early part of next year, with the concurrence of the Colonial Governments concerned. &amp;quot;Gentlemen of the House of Commons, .. &amp;quot;I note with satisfaction that the imports and exports of the country continue to show a steady and accelerating increase, and, together with the growing activity of trade at home, indicate that the industries of my people are in general in a sound and progressive condition. 66 The additions which have been made in recent years to the national expenditure and to the capital liabilities of the State are matters to which I invite your earnest attention. &amp;quot;The Estimates of charge which will be laid before you will be presented in as moderate a form as time and circumstances have allowed. 66 My Lords and Gentlemen, 66 My Ministers have under consideration plans for improving and effecting economies in the system of government in Ireland and for introducing into it means for associating the people with the conduct of Irish&apos; affairs. It is my desire that the Government of the country, in reliance upon the ordinary law, should be carried on, so far as existing circumstances permit, in a spirit regardful of the wishes and sentiments of the Irish people; and I trust that this may conduce to the maintenance of tranquility and of good feeling between different classes in the community. -63 The social and economic conditions of the rural districts in Great Britain require careful consideration. Inquiries are proceeding as to the means by which a larger number of the population may be attracted to and retained on the soil, and they will be completed at no distant date. 66 A Bll will be laid before you at the earliest possible moment for amending the ex sting law with regard to education in England and Wales. &quot; &quot;xvi.

April 11. On the 2nd R. of the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Bill, the Ulster Unionist members attacked the Govt. for having made a local appointment in Co. Cork in questionable circumstances.—An animated debate ensued and divisions were taken. April 24. L-Lord Muskerry (C.) called attention to the disloyal and violent speeches of certain magistrates in Ireland.-Lord Denman, for the Govt., declined to discuss details, but asked that information should be sent to the Irish Ld. Chancellor. July 12. C-*In Supply, on the vote for the Local Govt. Bd. in Ireland the Nationalist members complained that the Department did not deal fairly with the local councils.-Mr. Bryce defended the Board, which had to safeguard the interests of the ratepayers. He dealt in turn with specific complaints.-The closure was carried by 140 to 62, and the vote was agreed to.—On the vote for the Chief Secretary&apos;s salary, Mr. Lonsdale (C.) moved a reduction as a protest against the treatment which the Unionists of Ireland were receiving at the hands of the Govt. He said the illegal courts of the United Irish League had been allowed to exercise their power and their victims received no adequate protection.-Col. Saunderson (C.) denounced the leniency shown to the League. Mr. Bryce replied, and denied that the Govt. had surrendered to the League. There was a decline of outrages and all persons who alleged they had been threatened were protected against intimidation and violence. The amendment was rejected by 240 to 41, and the vote was carried. July 26. CLANRICARDE ESTATE. Mr. Duffy (N.) introduced a Bill to provide for the expropriation of the Marquis of Clanricarde from his Irish estates.&amp;quot; He said the maintenance of law and order in Lord Clanricarde&apos;s district would be difficult if he were allowed to remain in possession of it.-Sir H. C.-Bannerman said he did not attempt to justify the attitude of Lord Clanricarde towards his tenants, but a Bill of this kind could not be carried further.-The Bill was read a first time. Nov. 28. *EDUCATION. On going into Supply on the Civil Service Estimates, Mr. Murphy (N.) moved a resolution that the provision for all branches of education in Ireland was insufficient and unsatisfactory.-Mr. Butcher (C.) said that as the Catholics would not go to Trinity College, and the Royal University was defective, he was not unwilling to accept the idea of a Roman Catholic University.-Mr. Dillon (N.) enlarged on the need of co-ordination in Irish education.-Sir E. Carson (C.) said that Trinity College had done all that was possible to conciliate Catholic opinion. He would support any reasonable solution of the difficulty.-Mr. Clancy (N.) said the education given in Irish schools was anti-Irish.-Mr. Wyndham (C.) agreed that there should be an extension of opportunities for University training. Mr. Bryce (L.), Chief Secy., admitted that not one branch of Irish education could be regarded as satisfactory. As to intermediate education, he intended to review the system of technical instruction. On the larger question of University education he was unable to make any statement as to the Govt.&apos;s intentions, but it would be useless to propose any scheme until there should be a reasonable prospect of carrying it out. The question was urgent, and he hoped it might be possible to reconcile conflicting views The difficulties in con- nection with education would be more easily dealt with under Home Rule. He hoped, however, to be able to effect some improvements.—The resolution was withdrawn. March 22. UNIVERSITY EDUCATION.-Mr. Duffy (N.) moved a resolution that the revenues of Trinity College, Dublin, were not used to the best advantage, and that the general body of the nation might benefit educationally from their use.-Mr. Campbell (C.) defended the College administration, and argued that if Roman Catholic students did not take advantage of it their Bishops were responsible.-Mr. Bryce (L.), Chief Secy., said a Commission would be appointed to inquire into the condition of the College. The resolution was withdrawn. March 20. *LABOURERS&apos; BILL.-Mr. Bryce (L.), Chief Secy., introduced a Bill to amend the law relating to labourers by providing a fund on land purchase terms, and giving loans up to 4 millions if necessary to local councils, which would enable 25,000 cottages to be built. To assist the Bill £22,000 a year would be provided from Irish sources, with a grant from the Exchequer of £28,000. May 28. Mr. Bryce moved the 2nd R. of a Bill to facilitate the erection of labourers&apos; cottages by rural district councils, and to enable labourers to acquire parcels of land by the aid of an Exchequer contribution computed on the basis of the number of cottages built by each council.-Mr. J. Redmond (N.) said the Bill would remedy defects of past legislation, and was an enormous advance on anything done hitherto. He argued, however, in favour of the free grant of £50,000 coming from Imperial sources. 20 &quot; &quot;424 POLITICAL NOTES. THE EDUCATION BILL, 1906-continued.

THE EDUCATION BILL, 1906-continued. THE FINAL STAGES OF THE BILL. The motion to consider the Lords&apos; amendments was discussed in the House of Commons on December 10 and agreed to on December 11. Sir H. Campbell- Bannerman&apos;s motion, &amp;quot;That the question of agreement or disagreement with the Lords&apos; amendments to the Education (England and Wales) Bill be put with respect to the amendments AS A WHOLE,&amp;quot; was carried, and on December 12 the Government amendment,&amp;quot; That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendments,&amp;quot; was carried, and a Committee being appointed, the following reasons were reported, agreed to, and ordered to be communicated to the Lords :- COMMONS REASON FOR DISAGREEING TO THE LORDS&apos; AMENDMENTS TO THE EDUCATION (ENGLAND AND WALES) BILL. &amp;quot;The Commons disagree to the amendments made by the Lords to the Education (England and Wales) Bill for the following reason— &amp;quot;Because the general effect of those Amendments is to alter completely the character of the measure as it left the Commons and to contradict the principles on which it was framed.&amp;quot; On December 17 and 19 the House of Lords considered the message from the Commons. Protests were made against the unprecedented procedure of refusing to discuss the amendments without assigning specific reasons for their rejection and against the curt and almost contemptuous tone of the message. A motion that the Lords do insist on their Amendments was carried, and the following message was communicated to the Commons:- 6c LORDS REASON FOR INSISTING ON THEIR AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL TO WHICH THE COMMONS DISAGREED. &amp;quot;The Lords insist on their Amendments to the Education (England and Wales) Bill to which the Commons have disagreed for the following reason- &amp;quot;Because the Lords do not admit that the said Amendments contradict the principles upon which the Bill is framed or alter the character of the measure except in so far as they attempt to provide for the rights of parents, the freedom of teachers, and the just treatment of denominational schools.&amp;quot; On December 20, in the House of Commons, Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman moved that the order for the consideration of the Lords reason for returning their amendments be discharged, and, after debate, the motion was agreed to and the Bill was dropped. MR. A. J. BALFOUR, M.P., EXPLAINS THE LORDS&apos; AMENDMENTS. On November 28, 1906, in a speech in the Junior Constitutional Club, London, the Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, M.P., dealt at length with the amendments made by the Lords, and said :- I propose to examine in detail as to the alleged grounds upon which the Government appear to desire to fight with the House of Lords. THE CHARGE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF LORDS. • The Prime Minister, if I interpret him rightly, has declared war against the Upper House. Well, if war there is to be, if the lists are to be cleared, if the combatants are to meet in open fight, let us know what the struggle is about, and either not enter upon it at all, or enter upon it with a clear perception of what we mean to do and a firm determination to do it. What is the charge made against the treatment which the House of Lords is in process of meting out to the Education Bill now under discussion? Put shortly, I understand that all the three Cabinet Ministers to whom I have referred declare that that measure has been so changed, so mutilated, that the Government do not know their own child, and that it seems likely that that child will come back to them in a form in which they will absolutely refuse to recognise its legitimacy. What basis is there for that charge? Their changes have been important-that I do not deny. The effect of those changes, if the Bill becomes law, will be great, I admit; but all these changes, with the exception of one, to which I will refer more particularly later, are in the direction of making the Education Bill what its authors themselves have said it ought to be. &quot; &quot;394 POLITICAL NOTES. THE EDUCATION (ENGLAND AND WALES) BILL, 1906, AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS. In order that the readers of the Constitutional Year Book may have a reliable record of what happened to this ill-conceived measure in its progress through the House of Lords, the text of the Bill as it left the House of Commons and as it left the House of Lords is set out in parallel columns below. It should be borne in mind that a large number of the amendments made in the House of Lords were made on the initiative of the Government:- :- AS IT LEFT THE COMMONS. A BILL INTITULED AN ACT TO MAKE FURTHER PROVISION WITH RESPECT TO EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES.

Arrangements with respect to schoolhouses of existing Voluntary schools. 2.—(1) A local education authority for the purpose of continuing any existing voluntary school as a school provided by them, in cases where they desire to do so, may with the consent of the Board of Education make any arrangements they think fit by agreement with the owners of the schoolhouse of the school for obtaining such use of it as is required for carrying on a public elementary school, and may as occasion requires renew any such arrangement or make fresh arrangements for the purpose in a similar manner; but it shall be a con- dition of any such arrangement- (a) that the local education authority during the continuance of the arrangement keep the schoolhouse AS IT LEFT THE LORDS. A BILL (AS AMENDED ON THIRD READING) INTITULED AN ACT TO MAKE FURTHER PROVISION WITH RESPECT TO EDUCA- TION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. Be it enacted by the King&apos;s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:- PART I. ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. :- No schools recognised as public elemen- tary schools except those of Local Education Authority. 1.-On and after the first day of July One thousand nine hundred and eight (or such later date, not being later than the first day of January nineteen hundred and nine), as the Board of Education may appoint for the area of any local education authority on the application of that authority, a school shall not be recognised as a public elementary school unless it is a school provided by the local education authority, and unless some portion of the school hours of every day is set apart for the purposes of religious instruction. Arrangements with respect to schoolhouses of existing Voluntary schools. 2.-(1) A local education authority, for the purpose of continuing any existing voluntary school as a school provided by them, may, with the consent of the Board of Education, make any arrangements they think fit by agreement with the owners of the schoolhouse of the school for obtaining such use of it as is required for carrying on a public elementary school, and may as occasion requires renew any such arrangement or make fresh arrangements for the purpose in a similar manner; but it shall be a condition of any such arrangement- (a) that the local education authority during the continuance of the arrangement keep the schoolhouse in good repair, and are enabled to &quot; &quot;xii.

May 28. On Cl. 2 (local education authorities may, with the consent of the Bd. of Education, make arrangements with the owners of voluntary schools to continue them as provided schools), Mr. Long (C.) moved to postpone the clause, arguing that it could not then be discussed with practical effect.-Mr. Birrell said Cl. 2 was not compulsory, but facilitated bargains.-Amendment rejected by 238 to 99. -Sir W. Anson moved that the local authority should continue any existing voluntary school as a provided school when the owners so wished.-Mr. Birrell opposed what he called a one-sided scheme.-Mr. Dillon said the Bill as it stood would destroy an enormous number of voluntary schools by enabling local authorities to boycott and starve them.—Mr. Birrell said that local authorities would not exercise bigoted animosity against voluntary schools.-Mr. Balfour contended that the Govt. were violating their promises that denominational facilities would be provided. If local authorities could refuse to continue voluntary schools, denominational teaching might disappear.-Maj. Seely (L.) appealed to Mr. Birrell to meet objections by giving an appeal to the Bd. of Education.-Mr Wallace (L.) said that if the Govt. held that voluntary schools should not continue to exist they should say so boldly.— Mr. Birrell replied that an appeal to the Bd. of Education would not avail against religious intolerance. If local authorities were obliged to acquire all voluntary schools owners should be obliged on the other hand to hand over their premises to the authority. The compulsion must be reciprocal. The amendment was rejected by 313 to 133.- A proposal to give local authorities the free right to use transferred schoolhouses for evening classes was rejected by 335 to 97.-Mr. Thornton (C.) proposed that the arrangements should include an agreement for a substantial rent. Sir W. Robson said the Govt. contemplated that reasonable rent would be paid.-Mr. Balfour said that peppercorn rents were paid in many cases for schools under the Act of 1870.- After closure, the amendment was rejected. June 11. Maj. Seely (L.) moved to give owners of voluntary schools a right of appeal to the Bd. of Education against the decision of a local authority refusing to continue a school. -Mr. Birrell said the Govt. were anxious that all properly equipped schools should be transferred, and would consider the suggestion on Report.-Mr. Chamberlain said this was no concession, but merely carrying out the original pledges of the Govt.— Mr. J. Redmond thanked the Govt, for the concession.-Maj. Seely offered to withdraw his proposal, but a division took place and it was rejected by 330 to 104.-Mr. Rawlinson (C.) moved that a local authority should not be entitled to refuse to take over a school merely because the owners stipulated for facilities for religious teaching under Cls. 3 and 4.-Mr. Birrell regarded the amendment as worthless as a safeguard.—After closure, it was rejected by 326 to 104.-Sir F. Powell (C.) moved that &amp;quot;improvements should not be made which might prejudice the use of the school by the owners for any purpose consistent with the trust.-Negatived by 349 to 70.-Mr. Bridgeman (C.) moved that the wishes of the owners as to alterations and improvements should be consulted. Rejected by 321 to 87.-Mr. Birrell undertook, on Report, to provide that owners of schools not under trust should have a right to carry out alterations and improvements themselves, at the cost of the authorities. June 12 The suspension of the 11 o&apos;clock rule having been carried by 366 to 86, Sir_H. C.-Bannerman moved a resolution allotting 13 additional days to the Education Bill in Committee, three days for Report, and one day for the 3rd R. He said the Govt. contemplated an adjournment over August and September and an autumn Session to finish the business of the year. The proceedings on the Education Bill must be curtailed, and time allocated for the clauses in proportion to their importance. He disliked intensely such interferences with full debate, but they were necessary in the absence of systematic methods of procedure.-Mr. Balfour moved a hostile amendment and complained that the House was asked to closure a Bill as to which it was in im- portant respects in the dark, the Govt. having abstained from making adequate explanations. The financial clauses involved a grant of £1,000,000, and it was not known on what principle it would be given. Part IV. gave administrative Home Rule to Wales as to education; yet one day was thought sufficient for its discussion. The time given was far shorter than in 1902, when the Prime Minister proposed its extension. The Govt. had no special mandate for the Bill and its proposals were degrading to the House.-Mr. Asquith (L.) argued that the time allowed as a whole was sufficient, as the principles of the Bill had been discussed over and over again in the country.-Mr. L. Jones (L.) said he could not vote for closure by compartments. -The amendment was rejected by 341 to 171.-Other amendments to extend the time were negatived by large majorities.-The Govt. agreed to allot one extra day to &quot; &quot;THE PARLIAMENTARY FRANCHISE. 261 COUNTIES-Continued. Successive Occupation.-If two or more premises in the same division of a county, or in the same county if it is undivided, are occupied in im- mediate succession, the vote is not thereby lost. If the occupier is omitted from the list, a claim should be sent to the overseer by August 20th, giving particulars of all the premises so occupied. Poor Rates-The occupier must have been rated in respect of the premises to all poor rates made during the qualifying period. All poor rates due on January 5th must have been paid on or before July 20th. If the owner is liable for the rates, and has not paid them, the tenant may pay them, and deduct the amount from the rent. Wherever the landlord pays the rates, the overseers are bound to insert the occupier&apos;s name in the rate-book. Claims The names of qualified householders and occupiers must be placed by the overseers on the list published by them on August 1st. No claim is necessary in their case, but if any names are omitted by the overseers, a notice of claim must be sent on or before August 2)th. 3.-LODGERS. The inhabitant occupier, for the 12 months preceding July 15th in any year, of lodgings in the same house within the county (or division) of the clear yearly value, if let unfurnished, of £10 or upwards. Note. The term &amp;quot;lodgings&amp;quot; comprises any apartment or place of residence, whether furnished or unfurnished, in a dwelling- house, where the landlord resides and retains control over the passages and outer doors. Residence is required. Joint Occupation.-The inhabitant occupier, jointly with others, of lodgings of such clear yearly value, if let unfurnished, as gives a sum of not less than £10 for each occupier, is entitled to claim a vote; but no more than two such joint occupiers may be registered in respect of one set of lodgings. Occupation of lodgings in a Parliamentary borough cannot qualify to vote for a county. The occupation in immediate succession of different lodgings of sufficient value in the same house will qualify. But removal from one house to another disqualifies for the year. Additional rooms may be taken during the year without vitiating the qualification. Claims.-Lodgers not already registered must send to the overseers claims to vote on or before August 20th. Those already regis- tered must renew their claims yearly, on or before July 25th. BOROUGHS-Continued. Successive Occupation.-If two or more premises in the same borough (whether in the same division or not is immaterial) are occupied in im- mediate succession, the vote is not thereby lost. If the occupier is omitted from the list, a claim should be sent to the overseers by August 20th, giving particulars of all the premises so occupied. Poor Rates-The occupier must have been rated in respect of the premises to all poor rates made during the qualifying period. All poor rates due on January 5th must have been paid on or before July 20th.

Chancellor, said the Bill would not alter the law of succession.-Read a second time.-May 15.-The Bill subsequently passed into law. (See STATUTES, post.) NATAL. See under AFRICA, S. C-Navy. * ESTIMATES.-On going into Supply, Mr. E. Robertson (L.), Secy. to the Admy., explained the Estimates for 1903-7, which, he said, were prepared by the late Govt. and were based on a new naval policy, which their successors had accepted with few changes. The Rosyth scheme had, for instance, been modified though not aban- doned. Lord Cawdor&apos;s policy would be given a fair trial. The cost of the Navy was now not less than £36,000,000, reduced from £42,000,000 in 1904, or £6,000,000 less. The Estimates for 1906-7 showed a reduction of £1,520,000. The sum for new construction was about £9,250,000. There could be no great diminution of naval expenditure. The total naval burden borne by Europe and America was £101,500,000, and he asked why England should not place itself at the head of a League of Peace.-Mr. Lee (C.) argued that we needed an invincible Navy, especially during a period of naval develop- ment. The Japanese war had taught us many lessons and had revolutionized naval affairs. Every British ship under the new scheme was ready for battle, so that the country had value for its money.-Mr. Bellairs (L.) advised the appointment of a committee of three impartial men who should sift the whole expenditure.-Mr. Arnold- Forster (L.U.) claimed that the changes effected had reduced our naval expenditure enormously and had also enormously increased efficiency.-Mr Jenkins (Lab.) moved an amendment that the Govt. should pay dockyard workmen in the dockyards the standard trade union local rate of wages, and that the accredited representatives of the workmen should be recognised.—Mr. E. Robertson agreed that these proposals were reasonable and accepted them generally.-Amendment negatived.-The votes for the personnel and for wages were agreed to. March 1. On the vote of £1,954,000 for works and repairs, Mr. Lambert (L.), Civil Ld. of the Admy., explained that contractors would be required to pay the wages prevailing in the districts where the work was done. The increase of the vote was largely due to interest payable on loans contracted under Naval Works Acts.-Mr. Lee (C.) said the arrears of naval works had now been largely made good, and reduced expenditure would follow. He urged that the works at Rosyth should not be delayed.—Mr. Cremer (Lab.) protested against the large expenditure, and was amazed that the creation of a naval base at Rosyth was not abandoned.-Mr. Lambert said that in this respect there was need for deliberation at the Admiralty. If the works were necessary for the defence of the country, they would be proceeded with.-The vote and others were agreed to.-On Report of the vote for men and boys, Mr. Money (L.) and Mr. Byles (Lab.) opposed the continuance of the high expenditure. March 7. The votes for victualling and clothing, for martial law and for naval education were discussed.—Mr. Bellairs (L.) attacked the new scheme of training as against the interests of the democracy. He advocated the appointment of a fresh committee on the subject.-Mr. Lee (C.) said the subject was difficult and complicated and should be left to experts.-Mr. E. Robertson (L.), after explaining the Admiralty plan, said they would watch its operation very closely, but could not delegate its responsibility to any committee.The vote with others was agreed to. May 24. In Supply, on the Shipbuilding Vote, Mr. E. Robertson (L.), Secy. to the Admy., made a statement of the policy of the Govt. The Admiralty had decided that they could, with safety, modify Lord Cawdor&apos;s programme, and proposed that three Dreadnoughts should be laid down instead of four, two ocean-going destroyers instead of five, and eight submarines instead of 12. There would thus be a saving of £2,500,000. Referring to the International Conference at The Hague and to the movement in favour of reduced armaments, he said the prospect justified his dis- closing the intentions of the Admiralty for 1907-8. In that year new shipbuilding would be limited to two armoured ships: but more armoured vessels could be laid down if The Hague proposals for reduction should be abortive. The Bd. of Admy. was satisfied that the modified programme could be carried out without impairing the naval supremacy of the country. There was reason to believe that foreign naval programmes had also been recently modified. The saving contemplated was not insufficient, considering our vast Imperial responsibilities.-Mr. Lee (C.) deeply regretted the announcement, and asked that it should be justified. He knew of no reduction in foreign building programmes, and there was no evidence of any movement &quot; &quot;POLITICAL NOTES. $423 THE EDUCATION BILL, 1906-continued.

The Fleet could defend our coasts. Therefore we needed an expe- ditionary force just large enough to reinforce swiftly the outposts of the Empire. For great emergencies they would rely on the people organized on a voluntary basis, and behind the people were the Colonies. He believed it possible to have a Reserve behind the Army without compulsion. His proposal was that the Army should be reduced by 20,000 regulars. The force for mobilization in war would consist of six big divisions of infantry, and with them four cavalry brigades and a full complement of artillery. There would be an expeditionary force of 150,000 men; 50,000 with the colours, 70,000 Reservists, and 30,000 men trained on a Militia basis. The Defence Committee held that we could safely reduce eight battalions abroad and two battalions at home. There was a deficiency in the artillery which could be made good by taking 13,000 garrison Militia and Regulars, who could serve with ammunition columns and form an artillery reserve. Ninety-three batteries of field artillery would be kept up, of which 63 would be the artillery complement of the field force. The old 15-pounder field guns would be given to the Volunteers. These changes would increase field artillery by 50 per cent. and save £300,000 a year. The horse artillery would not be touched. The reductions would be carried out gradually and by absorption. Two battalions of Guards would be reduced; the 3rd Scots Guards and the 3rd Coldstreams and eight Line battalions (which he named). In future, enlistment would be-for infantry, seven years with the colours and five years in the reserve; Guards, three and nine; cavalry, seven and five; field and horse artillery, six and six; and garrison artillery, eight and four. He hoped the social condition of the soldier would be improved, and that he would be fitted for employment after he had left the colours. As to the Auxiliary Forces, the Militia must engage to serve abroad in war time and be territorialized completely. Weak battalions would be reduced and the force consolidated and become the first line of reserve behind the regulars. The Volunteers would have to defend naval fortresses, to repel possible raids, and to form a second reserve for the Army. They would be organized and duties assigned to them in different localities. County associations would be formed which would concern themselves with the local affairs of the Auxiliary Forces. In dealing generally with the expansion of our forces, he declared that compulsion would fail, but that if local interest was aroused the people would readily render assistance and would undergo in sufficient numbers some pre- liminary training.-Mr. Arnold-Forster regretted that the economy was to be produced by sacrificing ten units of infantry. The organization should be completed before the regulars were reduced. Enlistment for seven years would not afford the necessary power of expansion. He deprecated reliance on a casual county council Army.-Sir C. Dilke (L.) criticised several parts of Mr. Haldane&apos;s plan. Mr. Balfour asked for ample time to consider it, but thought it disclosed no practical scheme for expansion and seemed to begin at the wrong end.—Mr. Haldane replied on the whole discussion. The notion of conscription could, he said, be laid aside and expansion secured by organizing the people for military service under his scheme. He declined to delay the reforms, as he had been sent to the War Office to act, not to sit still. July 12. Mr. F. E. Smith (C.) moved the adjournment to call attention to the intention of the Govt. to reduce the Army forthwith without the sanction of Parliament. He said that no proper opportunity was given for discussing the proposals. Lord Roberts had declared that our Army was only just strong enough to police the Empire. —Mr. Balfour said the Opposition held that there was no precedent for the course the Govt. were taking in refusing to supply opportunities to debate a great Army scheme before it was carried into execution. Mr. Haldane referred to the naval reforms of Lord Selborne and Lord Cawdor as precedents. His own proposals were not revolutionary, and had been part of his predecessor&apos;s plans. There would have been more time for debate if the Opposition had not used it for other subjects.- Mr. Arnold-Forster denounced what he called a breach of faith with the House.- Maj. Anstruther-Gray (L.U.) talked the subject out, Sir H. C.-Bannerman having moved the closure, which the Speaker declined to accept. July 19. L-Lord Donoughmore (C.) called attention to the reductions in the military forces now being made and projected.-Lord Roberts deprecated any such serious reduction as that of 20,000 trained men before any steps were taken to reorganize the Army. If this was carried out in obedience to a false economy, trouble would arise, involving the country in far greater expenditure. He approved of the proposal that the Militia should serve abroad and would include the Yeomanry. He wanted to see a recognition of the duty of every man to be thoroughly trained.—Lord Portsmouth declared that the public demanded reduction of expenditure, both in the interests of the Army &quot; &quot;&amp;quot;PARLIAMENTARY SUMMARY, 1906. 291 C-Army-*ARMY ESTIMATES-continued. the best trade union private firms.-Negatived.-In Committee, on the vote for 204,100 officers and men a general discussion took place. March 8. Major Seely (L.) moved to reduce the vote by 10,000 men, in order to effect a sub- stantial reduction in military expenditure.-Sir C. Dilke said the cost of the land forces of the Empire was £60,000,000 a year, and we were not justified in spending so large a sum. The battalions kept at home in time of peace should be reduced.-Mr. A. Balfour (C.) said it seemed to be admitted that the cost of the Army was not due to the reckless and wasteful administration of the late Government. The Committee in considering the proposal to reduce the Army should form a clear idea of what a war for the defence of India would mean. In our present friendly relations with Russia, we were justified in looking forward to peace; but that was not enough. The defences must be adequate to meet any possible emergency. Any reduction must form part of a general scheme, which should enable us to face a prolonged war. Soldiers could, perhaps, be made in a year, but it was impossible to improvise officers, or artillery, or a staff.-Mr. Haldane, replying on the debate, said he should not produce any cut-and-dried plan before having thoroughly mastered the problem. Mistakes led to waste of money; and there should be continuity of policy. The public thought there should be less spent on military and naval organization, and economies might be discovered. At present we could mobilize in this country 330,000 men, and if 130,000 men were taken as our striking force, there was a large surplus which might possibly be reduced by reorganiza- tion without impairing efficiency. To this question he should devote himself in the next year, but he objected to be forced at the present time to reduce the battalions at home while retaining the battalions abroad at their present strength. He did not wish to hold out promises of large reductions, as there might be a clamour for equally hasty augmentation. The important thing was to have a skeleton organization capable of expansion on occasion.-Lord Dalmeny (L.) spoke of the alarm and despondency caused in the Army by the changing policies of successive Ministers.- Mr. J. Ward (Lab.) supported the reduction. Mr. Arnold-Forster said there was great room for reduction, and that he had himself reduced the cost of the Army; but no country could safely enter upon a war with an amateur army, ill-officered and ill- trained. Sir H. C.-Bannerman, speaking on the question of policy, said the Govt. would be as little provocative as possible, and that they would depend to a large extent on the nation&apos;s external policy. For ten years our military expenditure had steadily increased and the Govt. were straining every nerve to stop the growth of expenditure. Instead of reducing the troops, there were other methods of saving- by better administration and organization. He hoped the amendment would not be pressed.-A division was, however, taken, and it was rejected by 296 to 56.—The vote was then agreed to. March 15. L-Lord Hardinge (C.) called attention to the organization and condition of service in the Militia.-Lord Portsmouth (L.) Under-Secy., agreed that the force was not in a very satisfactory state, and said that its future organization had not yet been deter- mined, but would be considered in conjunction with the regular Army. The system of training would be improved, and by other changes it was hoped that the Militia would recover its old prestige.-Lord Donoughmore (C.) referred to the disloyal action of persons in Ireland to prevent young men joining the Army, the Navy, and Con- stabulary. Prosecutions for such attempts had been dropped by the new Government, --Lord Ripon (L.) said that recruiting in Ireland had not suffered, and that it would be unwise to take stringent measures.-Lord Lansdowne (L. U.) also spoke, and acknowledged the frank admission of Mr. Haldane that the Army was never in a better condition. March 19, -On the vote for pay, Mr. Lee (C.) discussed the general subject of Army policy.- Mr. Cox (L.) advocated a reduction of the garrison in India.—Mr. Molteno (L.) sug- gested that the garrison in S. Africa should be withdrawn. Mr. Wyndham argued that the latter question depended on Colonial policy, and interference in colonial matters of internal interest might require an increased garrison. Mr. Haldane said that the organization of the Army should be treated as one and indivisible, but there were difficulties in the way of that ideal. It was easier to talk about economy than to effect it; but it was not impossible. Our organization provided a striking force of 130,000 and a surplus of 200,000, and such an enormous surplus might be reduced. The Cardwell system should not be changed hastily, as a change went to the very root of our Army system. As to the garrison in S. Africa, it could not be reduced until both British and Boers were contented and satisfied. With regard to the Militia and the Volunteers, he thought the country might obtain value for its money without any revolutionary changes. The Volunteers required a great deal more training than they got now, and the Militia should be levelled up as far as possible to the Regular 191 &quot; &quot;DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT. 69 MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES- continued. of the Treasury).

CHAMBERLAIN, LORD. — The office of the Lord Chamberlain (St. James&apos; Palace, S. W.), is a department of His Majesty&apos;s Household, and its head, who is always a Peer of high rank and a Privy Councillor, is a member of the Ministry for the time being. He superintends all the officers and servants of the Household above stairs (see Lord Steward for below), the department of the Wardrobe, the Jewel House at the Tower of London, and the licensing of plays in the metropo- lis north of the Thames. He has the direction of the details of State functions such as coronations, Royal marriages, public entries, and funerals. In his de- partment are the Royal Physicians, the Chaplains, the Chapels Royal, the Ser- geants-at-Arms in Parliament, and the care of the Royal swans on the Thames. His Deputy, the Vice-Chamberlain, is usually a member of the House of Com- mons, and until recently has also been a Privy Councillor. LORD CHAMBERLAINS SINCE 1867.

Admission to the House of Lords when Parliament is not sitting is granted to strangers under regulations made by the Lord Great Chamberlain. On all State occasions he has the charge of Westminster Hall, as when it is used for a trial or a coronation. At a coronation he has functions of a numerous and varied character. When the Sovereign goes to Parliament, this officer walks on the right of the Sword of State, next to the Royal Person.

He is ordinarily appointed by the delivery of the Great Seal into his custody. He is keeper of the Royal conscience, custodian of the Great Seal, visitor in right of the Crown of all hos- pitals and colleges of Royal foundation, and patron of between 600 and 700 Crown livings and twelve canonries.

These changes would remove all danger of cruelty, and gross infringements of liberty.__ But they did not do away with the fundamental objection to the system, and if the Transvaal Parliament did not bring the experiment slowly, but surely, to an end, H.M. Govt. reserved their freedom of action.—Mr. Wyndham (C.) said the responsibility for Chinese labour now rested on the Ministry, who should either apologize for the charges they had made, or should prove that they believed them to be true by putting an end to the system. If the charge were true, the half-measures proposed were wholly insufficient, and the Govt. were courting disaster in S. Africa.-Mr. Birrell (L.) justified the leaflets issued from the Liberal Publication Department as straightforward and fair. The Govt., he said, would allow no further importations of Chinamen.-Sir E. Clarke (C.) referred to the shameful placards issued for the purpose of holding up the Unionist party to the execration of the people, and containing abominable untruths. Feb. 22. Dr. Macnamara (L.) declared that the agitation was spontaneous. The system was slavery, and must be done away with.-Lord Percy (C.) pointed out that the Govt. had been compelled to recognise this as a matter which primarily concerned the Transvaal, and that to prohibit coolie labour would probably ruin the Colony. China was the only available source of such labour; other experiments had failed. Chinese labour had been employed elsewhere without protest. The Govt. had climbed into power with the aid of the slavery scare, and now, sooner than apologize to their opponents for the false statements which had been made, they took refuge in a technical distinction between slavery and &amp;quot;servile conditions.&amp;quot; He asked if the Prime Minister still held that the indenture system was slavery. Sir H. C.-Bannerman denied ever having said so. He had said that it was tainted with, and had many of the character- istics of, slavery.-Mr. Asquith (L.), Chan. of Exchr., said the Convention of 1881 declared that no slavery or apprenticeship partaking of that character would be tolerated in the Transvaal. The system entailed the greatest danger of abuse, and it was impossible to let all the Chinamen loose upon the Rand at once; the Govt. intended to provide for the repatriation out of Imperial funds. The new Transvaal Govt. would be responsible in the fullest sense, and it would be for them to decide whether or not yellow labour should be continued. The Governor of the Colony would be instructed to reserve for the Imperial authorities any measures dealing with the subject of labour, and the conditions under which such labour should be carried on, and any local legislation which conflicted with the best British traditions would be vetoed. Mr. J. Chamberlain (L. U.) said that there were two sections of the Liberal party concerned, one which allowed shameful accusations to be made without correction and contradiction and knowing them to be untrue, profited by them; the other believed the statements to be true and promised to do all in their power to put an end to &amp;quot;slavery.&amp;quot; The latter, however, were now silent on their leaders&apos; policy. It was inconsistent to tell the Transvaal people that they would be trusted absolutely, and at the same time to warn them that there was a rod in pickle for them in the form of the veto. The repatriation scheme gave the Chinese a holiday at the expense of the British taxpayer. Slavery was to be abolished by instalments. Those who held that the system was slavery ought not to accept Ministers&apos; excuses for not ending it at once. All the Chinese could be sent back if it were so decided. A judicial inquiry ought to be held in justice to those who had been calumniated in this country, and to our colonial fellow subjects and officials. The amendment was rejected by 416 to 91. Feb. 23. 66 &amp;quot;&amp;quot; L-Lord Milner (L.U.) called attention to the situation in S. Africa and asked for information as to the form of the proposed Constitutions of the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony. He said there had been disquiet in S. Africa since the Govt. came into power. Responsible government was, it was said, to be immediately given to the Orange River Colony, but such a risky experiment ought to be tried first in the Transvaal, where the risk would not be so great. In the Orange River Colony the Boer leaders, Ministers and Press had always thwarted the policy of reconciliation and had kept alive the bitterest memories of the war. Under the new policy every- thing that had been done could be reversed, and British settlers, teachers, and officials would gradually be got rid of. What was the Govt. going to do with regard to these classes? Their policy involved a sudden revolutionary change. They would find it necessary to modify the grant of full self-government, and they ought to retain powers of control in matters not purely local. As the situation in the Transvaal was not equally alarming, priority should be given to that Colony. He advocated the grant, ultimately, of complete self-government; but a settlement should be reached &quot; &quot;MEMBERS AND CANDIDATES, 1885-1907. 241 Gilbey, A. Giles, Alfred, d. Giles, C.

With regard to the income inter- cepted for Local Taxation Account he condemned the system, which called urgently for review. Turning to the year 1906-7, he estimated the Imperial expenditure at £141,786,000, and for Local Taxation Account at £9,835,000, making together £151,621,000. The cost of the Supply services was the gigantic and excessive sum of £111,000,000, but he hoped next year that substantial savings would be effected without weakening the national services. He estimated the total Exchequer receipts from taxes at £119,930,000, and the other receipts brought the total to £144,860,000, an increase of £882,000 over 1905-6. The balance-sheet, on the basis of existing taxation, gave an estimated surplus of £3,074,000, or deducting £400,000 for emer- gencies, a surplus of £2,700,000. Before stating his proposals for dealing with it, Mr. Asquith made a general survey of the situation, drawing attention to the great growth of expenditure, both of which he said demanded a return to economy. Having explained the relative amount of dead-weight debt and other liabilities, he condemned borrowing for capital expenditure, and announced that new military and naval works would no longer be so provided for. The reduction of the floating debt was urgently needed. The amount available for the reduction of capital Debt was nine millions, to which would be added the realised surplus of 1905-6 (£3,466,000), and he proposed to take out of the estimated surplus for 1906-7 a sum of £500,000, and £500,000 from the Chinese war indemnity. The total provision made in 1906-7 would therefore be £13.500,000. He should also provide £135,000 for necessitous school districts and £100,000 for postal reforms, leaving £2,000,000 available for relief of taxation. While admitting that an income-tax of 1s. was excessive in time of peace, he could not reduce it by a penny this year, but a committee of inquiry would be appointed. There would be a reduced duty on stripped tobacco, and the export duty on coal, as indefensible, would be repealed as from 1st November, 1906, at a cost of £1,000,000. The other article selected for relief was tea, the tax on which would be reduced from 6d. to 5d. at a cost to the revenue of £920,000. The surplus was thus disposed of, leaving a balance of £414,000 for contingencies. He asked the Committee to remember that the Govt. only came into office at the end of 1905, and that some of the governing factors of the situation were previously in existence. He hoped hereafter to reduce expenditure and debt and to readjust the incidence of taxation. The following table gives an analysis of the Budget for 1906-7 :- ESTIMATED RECEIPTS ON THE BASIS OF EXISTING TAXATION.

LORD-ADVOCATE OF SCOT- LAND (Dover House, Whitehall).--The Lord-Advocateship of Scotland is an ancient Office of State which is held direct from the Crown, and the holder changes with the Government. He is Public Prosecutor for Scotland, and in his duties as such is assisted by the Solicitor-General for Scotland, four principal Advocates Depute, and one Assistant Depute. His political functions in the management of Scottish affairs are of importance, many discretionary powers and a considerable amount of patronage being entrusted to him. Prior to the Union, he held a seat ex-officio in the Parliament of Scotland, and the Office has still the title of Right Honourable attached to it, in respect of its holder being ex-officio a member of the ancient Scottish Privy Council. Since the Union he has almost invariably had a seat in the House of Commons, where he answers questions relating to the legal business of Scotland, and assists in conducting Scotch legislation, the Government Bills being drafted under his superintendence. The Lord-Advocate is counsel for the Crown in all Crown civil cases, and also practises ordinarily in the Scottish Courts, having the privilege of sitting on the right of the table within the bar. He is usually appointed a Privy Councillor and a King&apos;s Counsel. The &quot; &quot;HOUSE OF COMMONS-HISTORY. 127 Naturally no attempt was made t amend the representation of the people during Mr. Gladstone&apos;s next period of office, which lasted from 1868 till 1874. In 1872, Mr. G. O. Trevelyan moved a resolution in favour of extending the Borough franchise to the Counties. A resolution of a similar tendency was brought forward by Sir Charles Dilke in 1873. Both were opposed by Mr. Glad- stone, and rejected by large majorities. When the Conservatives came into power in 1874, these resolutions, which were annually renewed, began to receive a growing support from the Liberal party, but it was not till 1878 that Lord Hart- ington, then the official leader of the Opposition, formally adopted the equal- isation of the franchise in town anl county as an article of the Liberal creed. The Franchise Act of 188 marks the third of the great changes in the Con- stitution of the House of Commons which have taken place in the present century. By this Act household suffrage and the £10 occupation and lodger franchise were extended to the counties throughout the United Kingdom. PROCEDURE. The rules of procedure in the House of Commons as regards public business are numerous and complicated. The follow- ing brief abstracts of the principal Standing Orders and regulations may be useful for reference; it has been abridged from the small volume, published annu- ally, entitled &amp;quot;Rules, Orders, and Forms of Procedure of the House of Commons.&amp;quot; Many of the technical terms used in con- nection with this subject will be found in the &amp;quot;Glossary of Political Terms.&amp;quot; post. The Chair.-The Speaker presides at all meetings of the House, and the Chairman of Ways and Means, as Deputy Speaker, acts in his absence, and also presides when the House is &amp;quot;in Committee.&amp;quot; There is also a Deputy Chairman, empowered to act in the absence of the Chairman, and as Deputy Speaker in the absence of both the Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Five members are nominated by the Speaker annually to act as temporary Chairmen of Committees when required. Sitting and Adjournment of the House.— The House now ordinarily meets at 2.45 p.m., except on Fridays. Business is preceded by prayers; after prayers the House is counted, and if 40 members be not present a second count is made at 4 o&apos;clock. If a quorum be not then present, the House stands adjourned until the next sitting day. If notice is taken, or the numbers in a division show, that 40 members are not present, the House at once adjourns. The time-table of business, as arranged in 1906, is as follows:- 2.45 p.m. 2.50 95 Not later than 3. 0 p.m. 3.45 8-8.30 8 15 11. 0 99 99 99 House meets. Prayers. Private business-not to last later than 3 p.m. Questions. Urgent questions. business. Informal adjournment. Public Consideration of adjourn- ment motion or private business (if any). End of public business. On every day, except Friday, public business ends at 11.0 p.m. Opposed business cannot afterwards be taken, but an exception may be made in regard to any particular matter on a motion by a Minister of the Crown, decided without debate. The ordinary sittings terminate at 11.30 p.m., unless prev ously adjourned, or unless a financial Bill or any proceed- ings taken under an Act of Parliament or Standing Order are under considera. tion, in which case the sitting may be prolonged if necessary. On Fridays the House meets at mid-day, and sits until 5.30 p.m., unless previously adjournel. Business is not entered upon until 40 members are present, but even if there be no quorum, the House cannot be adjourned until 4 o&apos;clock. The debate on any business is interrupted at 5 p.m., and no opposed business is taken afterwards. If No motion for the adjournment of the House can be made until questions have been disposed of, and no such motion can be made before the business of the day has been entered upon, except by leave of the House; a member rising in his place, proposes to move the adjournment for the purpose of discus- sing a definite matter of urgent public importance, and not less than 40 members rise in their places to support the motion; if fewer than 40 members and not less than 10 rise, the House determines by a division whether the motion shall be made. the motion is supported by 40 members, or is carried, it comes on for discussion at 8.15 p.m. When, during any debate, a motion is made to adjourn or to report progress, the debate the reupon must be con- fined to the matter of such motion; and no member who has moved or seconded any such mot on is entitled to move or second any similar motion during the same debate. If the Speaker or Chairman is of opinion that a motion for adjournment of the debate, or to report progress, is an abuse of the rules of the House, he may forthwith put the question thereupon from the chair, or he may decline to notice it. Conduct of Members.-Every member must be uncovered on entering or leaving the House, or on moving from one part &quot; &quot;272 LOCAL GOVERNMENT. PARISH COUNCILS AND MEETINGS. By the Local Government Act, 1894, Parish Meetings were brought into existence, the Guardians were reconstituted, and Parish, Rural District, and Urban District Councils were created. QUALIFICATION OF ELECTORS. For all elections under this Act the elector is the parochial elector,&amp;quot; who, by Section 44 of the Act, is defined to be any person on the Local Government Register, or on the parliamentary register of electors, and the term includes non-resident owners of property in the parish who are on the parliamentary register. PARISH MEETINGS. (u) Where there is a Parish Council there must be at least one annual meeting for the election of the Council, summoned by the chairman of the Council, by notice of not less than seven clear days before meeting. The meeting shall be held at an hour not earlier than 6 p.m. (b) In smaller parishes where there is no Parish Council, there must be at least two meetings a year. The chairman holds office for a year, and, with the overseers, forms a body corporate. The Parish Meetings consist only of parochial electors, and for the annual election of councillors a meeting is held in March. In absence of the chairman, the clerk of the Parish Council, or overseer, will discharge his duties. PARISH COUNCILS. I.-CONSTITUTION. Every rural parish having a population of 300 and upwards has a Parish Council (A_rural parish is one situated in a rural sanitary district.) In a rural parish with a population of 100 and upwards, if the Parish Meeting so decide, the County Council must issue an order for its establishment. In a rural parish with less than a population of 100 the County Council may, if the meeting so wish it, issue an order for its establishment, or such small parishes may, with consent of the meeting, be grouped together under a common Parish Council. The Council consists of a chairman and councillors. The councillors are elected at the annual or first Parish Meeting, if there is no poll required. If there is a pol&apos;. then the election is by ballot according to rules laid down by the Local Government Board. The electors are the parochial electors of the parish. The chairman is elected by the councillors at the annual meeting, which takes place on or within seven days after the 15th of April. The councillors and chairman hold office for three years from the 15th of April, 1904. The number of councillors is not less than 5 nor more than 15, the number being fixed by the County Council. The quorum of a Parish Council is one-third of the councillors, but in no case is the quorum to be less than three. Absence of a councillor frem meetings of the Council for more than six months consecutively, unless from illness or cause approved by the Council, vacates the seat. II.-QUALIFICATION OF PARISH COUNCILLORS. A person to be qualified as a parish councillor must be registered as a parochial elector of the parish, or must have come into residence within it, or within three miles of it, on or before the 25th March in the year preceding the election No person is disqualified by sex or marriage for being elected a parish councillor ; practically, therefore, any adult elector or resident of either sex is qualified for election. A person is disqualified for election when he [or she] (a) Is an infant or alien. (b) Has within 12 months before or after election received union or parochial relief. (c) Has within five years before or after election been sentenced to imprisonment with hard labour; or has been adjudged a bankrupt, or compounded with his creditors. (d) Holds a paid office under a parish council. (e) Is a contractor under the council or board, or profits by any contract er work done for them. &quot; &quot;518 IMPORTS AND EXPORTS-continued.

C-Address-continued. the Transvaal when constituted. Meanwhile, no coolie who wished to return home would be detained against his will by want of means, and the cost would be met out of public funds. Certain of the judicial methods, which the Govt. could not approve, would be abolished. On the question of free trade, a debate would take place in which he hoped the Opposition leaders would take part. In Ireland the Crimes Act would be repealed when the proper occasion presented itself. The Education Bill would be the chief measure of the Session. Mr. J. Redmond (N.) asserted that the Irish question could never be satisfactorily settled except by Home Rule, which was the most urgent of all Imperial questions. There had been no bargain between his party and the Govt.-Mr. K. Hardie (Soc.) said the Labour party held a watching brief for the workers and the poor, and would hold themselves aloof from ordinary party politics. Feb. 19. Maj. Seely (L.) described the system of Chinese labour as abominable, and as slavery &amp;quot;with a time limit.&amp;quot;—Mr. Arnold-Forster (L.U.) repudiated the charge of having sanctioned slavery. If it were true the moral offence could not be got rid of by shifting it on to the Transvaal Legislature.-Mr. Griffith (L.) urged the importance of dealing with the disestablishment of the Church in Wales.-Mr. W. O&apos;Brien (N.) said that every remedial Irish measure of the last 20 years was a confession of the justice of Ireland&apos;s demands. In a few years landlordism would have disappeared, and every Irishman could join in disendowing Dublin Castle and reducing expenditure. The Nationalist aspiration was for representative and responsible self-government. But at present the Irish party ought not to be aggressive, but proceed by degrees, clearing the way for a responsible Assembly.-Other subjects having been discussed, the debate was diverted to specific amendments (which see) as follows:- 1.-Scotland.-Small Houses.-An Amendment by Mr. Cross (L.U.).-Discussed and withdrawn. :- Feb. 20. 2.-Navy.-Amendment by Mr. McNeill (N.) in favour of abolishing flogging in the navy. Withdrawn. Feb. 21. Feb. 21. 3.—Ireland, Government of.—Amendment by Col. Saunderson.-Negatived, 408 to 88. 4.-Africa, South. Amendment by Mr. H. W. Forster (C.) condemning the policy of the Govt.-Rejected, 416 to 91. Feb. 23. Feb. 26. A motion to suspend the 12 o&apos;clock rule was carried by 343 to 59. 5.-India, Government of.-Amendment by Mr. H. Roberts (L.) in favour of giving the Indian people a larger share in the Administration-Withdrawn, after debate. Feb. 26. 6.—Alien Immigration.—Amendment by Sir W. Evans-Gordon (C.).—Withdrawn. Feb. 26. 7.-Sea Encroachment.-Amendment by Mr. S. Wilson (C.).—Withdrawn. Feb. 26. 8.-Labour.-Employment.-Amendment by Mr. C. Hay (C.).-Negatived. Feb. 26. The Address was agreed to. Feb. 26. ACCIDENTS BILL.-See under LABOUR. L-Africa.-CONGO.-The condition of affairs in the Congo was discussed, July 3, and in the Commons on July 5. 66 &amp;quot;&amp;quot; C-Africa, South.-TRANSVAAL AND ORANGE RIVER COLONY.-On the Address, Mr. H. W. Forster (C.) moved an amendment expressing regret that H.M. Ministers should have brought the reputation of the country into contempt by describing the employment of Chinese indentured labour in the Transvaal as slavery, whilst now contemplating no effectual method for bringing the system to an end. He quoted extracts from speeches delivered by various ministers who had applied the term &amp;quot;slavery to the conditions under which the coolies worked, and indignantly denied the correctness of the descrip- tion. The outcry had been raised for election purposes only. The least thing the Govt. could do would be to appoint a Royal Commission to ascertain the facts.-Mr. Churchill (L.), Under Secy., admitted that the system could not be classified as slavery without a risk of terminological inexactitude.&amp;quot; But the Govt. held the Chinese contract to be an improper one, and a derogation of labour. The Govt. had decided that the licences already issued must stand, and that as the sudden and arbitrary deportation of 60,000 coolies might bring about a complete economic collapse in the Transvaal, the system must be brought to an end gradually. The Govt. wished to rely in large measure on the opinion of the people of the Transvaal, and held that too much inter- ference on the part of this country would be unpopular. It must be left to the Transvaal Parliament to decide upon political, economical, and social grounds for or against Chinese labour. But H.M. Govt. had decided to prevent in future the deduction of fines from wages; to prevent the imposition of fines for various offences, and all trials were to be conducted in open court. They had also resolved to adopt a policy of &quot; &quot;HOUSE OF LORDS. 103 Mar, 12th E. of (cr. 1565, Sco.), and 14th E. of Kellie (cr. 1619, Sco.), Sco. Rep. Peer. Hon. Col. W. J. F.

THE EDUCATION BILL, 1906-continued. AS IT LEFT THE COMMONS. Education, the Board of Education may, if they think fit, exempt that council from the obligation to make a scheme under this section, but the council may at any time, if they think fit, make such a scheme, although the scheme is not prepared within the time limited by this section. (7) A scheme under this section may be altered or amended by a subsequent scheme made in accordance with the provisions thereof, and a county council may at any time make such a scheme for the purpose. (8) A county council shall not be under any obligation to appoint managers under section six of the Education Act, 1902, for a public elementary school if they consider that the management of the school is properly provided for by delega- tion to a representative body. (9) The accounts of the receipts and expenditure of a representative body under this section shall be made up and audited in like manner and subject to the same provisions (including penal pro- visions) as the accounts of a local educa- tion authority: Provided that if, in any case, the Local Government Board so determine, those accounts shall be audited as accounts of the county council, and in that case the auditor shall have the same power with respect to members of the representative body and their officers as he would have if those members and officers were officers of the county council. (10) If any local authority who are elected by the local government or parochial electors of their area, or any representative body for any delegation area under this section, request the council of the county in which the area is situated to incur specially for the benefit of that area expenditure in relation to elementary education beyond the normal expenditure in the rest of the county, the county council may, if they think fit, charge the expenditure so incurred separately upon that area. (11) In this section- L 66 The expression county&quot; does not include a county borough or the county of London, and does not include any part of a county which is not included in the area of the county council as local education authority under Part III. of the Education Act, 1902; &quot;&quot; The expression &quot;local government area means a borough, an urban or a rural district, or a parish. AS IT LEFT THE LORDS.

COUNTY COUNCILS. Under the Local Government Act, 1888, a County Council was established in every County in England and Wales, the duties of which body include all the administrative and financial business of the county formerly transacted by the Magistrates in Quarter Sessions. The next elections for the County Councils in England and Wales will take place, on a day to be fixed by the County Councils, between March 1st and March 8th, 1907. (If no day is so fixed, the el ctions will take place on March 8th.) A brief account is here given of the constitution of the County authorities and of the regulations under which the elections are conducted. CONSTITUTION OF COUNCIL. The Council consists of a Chairman, County Aldermen, and County Councillors. They are elected and conduct their proceedings similarly to existing Town Councils in boroughs, with some exce..tions. The County is divided into Electoral Divisions, each returning one Councillor. The Electoral Divisions are arranged so that the population of each is as nearly equal as possible, regard being had to the proper representation of rural and urban districts and to the distribution and pursuits of the population. Boroughs with over 50 000 inhabitants are constituted administrative counties of themselves, and their Town Councils are the sole authority under the Act. The enrolled burgesses in other municipal boroughs elect a certain number of representa- tives to the Council of the County in which they are situated; they are not, however, entitled to vote on any expenditure to which the boroughs are not assessed. London is constituted an administrative county, and each parliamentary division is an Electoral Division and elects two Councillors. The quorum of a County Council is one-fourth of the whole. The Councillors are elected trienially, and all retire together. A Councillor who is chosen to be an Alderman vacates his office of Councillor. Bankruptcy, or absence from the County for 12 months, disqualifies an Alderman or Councillor. CHAIRMAN.-The Chairman is elected by the Council from among the Aldermen or Councillors, or persons qualified to be such. He holds office for one year, and may receive such remuneration as the Council think reasonable. He is ex officio a Justice of the Peace for the County. COUNTY ALDERMEN. -The County Aldermen are elected by the Council and constitute one-third of the number of Councillors. A person is disqualified for election as an Alderman unless he is a Councillor, or qualified to be a Councillor A County Alderman may not as such vote in the election of a County Alderman. The term of office of a County Alderman is six years, but one-half of the fi.st Aldermen chosen under the Act retire at the end of three years. In the county of London the number of Aldermen must not exceed one-sixth of the number of Councillors. QUALIFICATION OF ELECTORS. In Municipal Boroughs the enrolle1 Burgesses choose the Courcillors to represent them on the County Council, and in the other parts of the county the qualifications entitling an Elector to be registered, and when registered to vote, are defined by the County Electors&apos; Act, 1888, substantially as follows:- PERSONAL.-An Elector may be a man or a woman, but must be of full age, not subject to any legal incapacity, and must not, within 12 months prior to July 15th, have received parochial (non-medical) relief. OCCUPATION.-An Elector must for 12 months prior to July 15th, (a) have been in occupation, joint or several, of a house, warehouse, counting- house, shop, or other building in the parish; or (b) must during the same period have been an occupier, as owner or tenant, of some land or tenement in the parish, of the yearly value of not less than £10. Joint occupation under (a) qualifies, irrespective of the value of the premises, and also under (b) if the value is sufficient, when divided, to give £10 for each occupier. &quot; &quot;ALLOTMENTS, ETC. 499 Allotments and Small Holdings.-Number of Allotments under Acre detached from Cottages in each of the years 1873, 1886, 1890, and 1895; Number of Holdings of Land not exceeding 1 acre (including allotments) in 1895; and Number of Small Agricultural Holdings of and under 50 acres in extent in 1895, in each County of England; with similar particulars for the whole of Wales and Scotland. 44.
