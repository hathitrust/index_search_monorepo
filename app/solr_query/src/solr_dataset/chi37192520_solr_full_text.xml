Following the last named is the Eddy road trestle, contain- ing 38 spans, each being 16 feet long. It is similar in style of con- struction and dimensions of its parts to the trestle at Euclid, except that in this there are two track stringers, each 6 by 14 inches. It has no guard rails. A number of caps and batter posts gave indications of de- cay, although none were found to be seriously weakened. No. 4. One mile west of the above is another trestle, containing 21 spans, each being 16 feet long. In style of construction and dimen- sions of various parts it is a counterpart of the trestle at Euclid, here referred to as No. 1. The ties are 3 by 8 inch oak planks, placed from 2 to 3 inches apart. It has no guard rails. No. 5. The trestle at Oak Grove, which has thirty-six 16-foot spans, crosses a deep ravine. It is at its maximum 33 feet high. There are under each rail three 6 by 14 inch track stringers, and the bents are double braced, laterally and longitudinally. The ties are 8 by 3 inch oak plank, and there are no guard rails. No. 6. With a slight exception, noted in trestle No. 3, the material in all structures on this road is in good condition, and, except in case of the ties, which are too light to sustain the wheels in case of derail- ment, are of sufficient strength for the very light service required. The entire absence of guard rails on all the trestles will be noticed. There is no protection whatever in case of derailment, and an accident of this nature occurring on any of these trestles must inevitably be productive of serious injury to persons on the cars, especially if it should occur on the Oak Grove trestle, where the train would fall from a height of 33 feet.

On the southern branch of the main line, from Elyria via Clyde, Fremont, etc., to Toledo, there are several important structures, which will be briefly referred to here. The first of these, west from Elyria, is a single track, two-arch stone viaduct over Vermillion river at Wakeman, built in 1872. This is a magnificent specimen of engineering, from its natural rock foundations to the summit of its bold arches. It is an ideal of boldness, as the one at Conneaut is of massive strength. No figures giving dimensions can give a proper idea of the really imposing appearance of this structure, and the closest inspection reveals no sign of deterioration. At Monroeville, over the west branch of the Huron river, is a two- span Post patent iron bridge, each span being 106 feet long. This also contains three trusses. The center one was put in for additional security in 1877. It contains 10 panels, each 10 feet 1 inch long. The center truss is heavier than the outside. The dimensions of the parts of exterior trusses are as follows: Lower chord end panel, two bars, 5 by inches, with open work between bars; second panel, two bars, 2 by 3-inch, and two 2 by g-inch; third panel, two bars, 2 by 1-inch, and two 2 by inch; fourth panel, four bars, 2 by 3-inch, and two bars 24 by -inch; center panel, four bars, 2 by -inch, and two bars 2 by -inch. Main braces, two bars, 2 by -inch at ends, to 2 by inch in center. Counters, 1 to 12-inch rods. Sway braces, 14-inch rods. Lower laterals, 1 to 14-inch rods. Pins, 2 to 23-inch. At Fremont, over Sandusky river, there is a two-span wooden Howe truss deck bridge, each span being 106 feet long. It was built in 1868, by McNairy &amp;amp; Claflin, and is covered. The ties are 6 by 8 inches, 4 inches apart, and there is a wooden 6 by 8-inch outer and an inner railroad iron guard rail. Lower chords, 5, 61, 61, 5 by 14 inches. End main braces, double, 74 by 10 inches. Tie rods, same panel, two, 2 inches, and one 14 inches diameter. Height of truss, 16 feet. Twelve panels, each 8 feet long. Trusses 12 feet apart. West of Fremont, over the Muskalonga river, there is a 44-foot span iron plate girder, resting on stone abutments, and built in 1880. The bridge over Portage river at Elmore is a 2-span iron Pratt truss, each span being 120 feet. It was built in 1877 by the Detroit Bridge and Iron Works. Height of truss, 21 feet 5 inches. Eight panels, each 14 feet 3 7-16 inches long. Lower chord sectional area 9 inches at ends, and 18 inches in center. Main braces at ends, two bars, 4 by 1½ inches; second set, two bars, 4 by 1-inch; center panel, two rods, 19- inch round. Counters, second set, two rods, 14-inch rods. Upper chord sectional area from 18.8 inches at ends to 22 inches in center. Sectional area of end posts, 28 inches. Suspension ties, two bars, 2 by 1-inch; second post, area 12.5 inches; third post, area, 7.5 inches. Wakeman, Vermillion river, stone viaduct. Monroeville, Huron river, Post truss.

[SEAL.] &quot; &quot;94 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. No. 32-bridge over the road- way, near the preceding; 15 • feet above ground. No 31-east of Anderson&apos;s station, 6 miles from Chillicothe. Trestle. No. 30-west of Anderson&apos;s. No. 29-North Fork of Paint creek. Main bridge. This is a Howe Truss of 8 panels, 94 feet each; total length, 84 feet;. width, 14 feet; height, 20 feet, clear. The main braces vary from 7 by 9 inches to 84 by 94 inches; the counters are all 7 by 9 inches.. The vertical rods are in pairs, and range from 1 to 2 inches. The lower chord has 4 pieces, 6 by 12 inches; the upper the same, except the depth is 10 inches. Floor, 8 by 5 inches, and 5 inches apart. The track stringers are 10 by 12 inches, and single; ribbons, 7 by 8 inches, notched and bolted; road beams, 6 by 14 inches, at intervals of 21 inches. The upper and lower laterals and diagonals are in the usual style. This bridge seems a little light for the traffic which passes over it, but, being short, no danger is to be apprehended, except in case of an extra heavy load. A low Howe Truss of 2 spans, 54 feet each. The braces vary from 6 by 7 inches to 74 by 74 inches; all the counters are 5 by 6 inches ;. ribbons, 7 by 8 inches, bolted and notched; flooring, 6 by 8 inches, and, 9 inches apart; track stringers, 10 by 10 inches; laterals as usual; the road beams are 6 by 13 inches, and 2 feet apart; the chords are triple, the pieces being 5, 8, and 5 inches wide, and 12 inches deep; the upper being only 11 inches deep. The bridge sunk considerably under a passing train, and I judge that it is hardly strong enough; a heavy load might cause disaster. Half a mile or so east of the preceding is a trestle-work 50 feet long, 4 frame bents, 12 feet high, with track stringers 12 by 13 inches; floor, ribbons, and lateral bracing as the preceding. Low Howe Truss, in all respects like No. 31, just given, except it is stronger. At each end is an approach 20 feet long, supported by frame- bents. The west approach to the main bridge is a low Howe Truss of two spans, clear height 74 feet; 10 panels, each 5 feet. The main braces vary from 6 by 74 inches to 7 by 7 inches; the counters are 6 by 6 inches; the rods are in pairs, and vary from 1 to 13 inches; road beams, 6 by 14 inches, and 21 inches apart; upper chord, triple, 5, 8, and 51 inches broad, and 11 inches deep; the lower chord is 1 inch deeper; track stringers, 5 by 10 inches, double and notched; floor, 8 by 6 inches, at 6 inches distance; ribbons, 7 by 9 inches, notched; chord, cov- ered with tin; the abutments and piers are good.. This has two spans of 11 panels, 10 feet each, usual height and width, and covered. In the east span the counters are all 6 by 9 inches; the mains vary a little, but are all very nearly 7 by 10 inches; the vertical suspension rods are in couples, and vary from 1 to 1 inches; the lower chord in both spans consists of 4 pieces, 6 by 14 inches; the upper, 6 by 12 inches; the track stringers are double, 5 by 10 inches; flooring 6 by 8 inches, at 6 inches interval; ribbons, 7 by 9 inches, notched; lateral braces, usual size; the road beams in the east span are 7 by 12 inches, and 24 feet apart; those in the west span are 6 by 14 inches, and 2 feet apart.

Bridges No. 11 and 12, Swine parts, etc., it is like similar structures of its class on this road, which have been before described. About one mile south of Middlefield are the two Swine creek tres- creek,trestles. tles, each being about 200 feet long and 27 feet high. Bridge No. 13, Howe truss deck. Bridge No. 14, Howe truss, near Farm- ington. Bridge No. 15, near State road, Har- rington tres- tle. Bridge No. 16, trestle, Young&apos;s run, near Warren. Bridges No. 17 and 18, War- ren. The ties are 6 by 8 inches, spaced 21 inches from center to center. The trestles are on a slight curve, and have no guard rails. They are braced longitudi- nally by two sets of horizontal longitudinal 2 by 8 inch plates, extend- ing from bent to bent. The timbers are in good condition, and dimen- sions like those in structures before described. Two miles south of Middlefield is a ten panel Howe truss deck bridge, 100 feet long. The lower chords are 6, 9, 6 by 12 inches. Floor beams, 6 by 14 inches, spaced 26 inches from center to center. The track stringers are 8 by 12 inches, let into floor beams 1 inch. There are no cross ties nor guard rails. The truss is 17 feet high, and the lower chord nearly 20 feet above the ground. The bridge rests on stone abutments. As in other bridges of its kind on this road there is very little protection against a spreading of the track, and, in case of derail- ment, nothing whatever to save cars from a fall of nearly 40 feet. The sway braces are 6 by 8 inches, but they are at the ends only, and there- fore nearly 100 feet apart. In the post panel at the north end the east lower chord is somewhat affected by decay. Aside from its faulty con- struction in regard to absence of cross ties and guard rail, the general condition of this bridge is unsatisfactory and unsafe. Near Farmington, over Grand river, is a 14-panel Howe truss bridge, 144 feet long, resting on stone masonry abutments. Its track stringers are 22 feet above the ground. Lower chords are 6, 9, 6 by 13 inches, and two end main braces, each 8 by 9 inches; two end tie rods, each 2 inches in diameter. The floor beams are 6 by 14 inches, four in each panel. Like the preceding bridge, No. 13, it has neither cross ties nor guard rails. The chord and other timbers of this bridge gave no indi- cations of weakness and decay. The Harrington trestle, near State Road Station, is 615 feet long. In this the track stringers have been overhauled and all found defective by decay; replaced by new ones, measuring 12 by 12 inches. Ties on this trestle are 6 by 8 inches, lying on their 6-inch edges, and spaced 22 inches from center to center. The bents have been overhauled, and some decayed parts replaced by new structures. At Young&apos;s run, near Warren, is a nine-bent trestle, 140 feet long, which has recently undergone partial renewal and repair. The span over the water-way is 20 feet long. The stringers in this span are two 12 by 12 inch pieces, one above the other. Elsewhere the spans are as usual on this road, 12 feet long, and stringers, single, 12 by 12 inches where new, and 10 by 12 inches where not renewed. This work has received new guard rails and partially new ties. The first structure on entering Warren is a short, well built trestle approach to a wooden bridge over the A. Y. &amp;amp; P. R. R. track. The &quot; &quot;538 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. Name, and how operated. Stock and debt. Total. Per mile. Ohio stockholders. Proportion for Number. stock held by Ohio.

Most of the lines are found in good condition, and the main lines excellent. It is gratifying to find the small structures carefully watched, and that they are mostly after some certain adopted standard, for which, with materials on hand, repairs can speedily be made; this is true of culverts, to some extent, and of cattle guards, though the standard is not the same on all the lines and branches. The flooring of bridges, exclusive of strings and bearers, is nearly the same throughout all the lines and branches. The standard flooring consists of sawed ties, 6 or 7 by 8 inches, usually lying flat, 10 feet long, oak. The wheel guards, or outside guard rails, are of the same material, placed on the side, with the inside top corner beveled 1 inch at 45 de- grees, spliced, flared outward at the termination at bridge approach by dressing off the end and inside corner to about a quarter circle of radius of 8 to 12 inches, and sometimes a larger sweep. They are notched about 1 inch upon all the ties, and bolted at about every fourth tie, and are placed at from 14 to 30 inches outside, usually about 20 inches. In the track, it is stated that suspension joints formed with the angle bar and Verona lock-nuts and bolts for fastenings are standard, and mostly in use. The joints are said to be placed alternate in all cases, though on the C. &amp;amp; P. an exception appears to be made, as here it is stated that the joints may even be accidental in arrangement of those of one side with respect to those of the other side of the track. Stone ballast is laid 10 inches deep under the ties, and sometimes deeper at points where the road-bed is low, a fill of 2 feet or more being sometimes made in stone ballast material. For the standard section of the W. Division&apos;s ballasted track, see last year&apos;s report, p. 390. The standard switch was last year stated to be the Wharton switch, for a description of which see last year&apos;s report, p. 399. The Loren switch, also described, ib., p. 401, is objected to, unless the safety spring is removed, as a pebble or other obstruction may prevent the full throw of the switch. It is stated that the &amp;quot;split switch&amp;quot; is now coming to receive the preference. The spring frog is not in favor on some parts of the line. An excellent frog, for simplicity, is made by the company at its shops, the same being, apparently, the result of much study and experience. It is probably the simplest efficient frog made. Rails at all points show some degree of &amp;quot;low joint,&amp;quot; but it appears to be least on the stone and slag ballast. Trains are run by a schedule and dispatcher, under the combined care of two persons. No block-signal systems were pointed out as in use on any of the lines. The quality of iron in the bridges can not be stated here, because no methods of inspection exist which enable inspectors to ascertain quali- ties of pieces of iron while in structures. The track of the western portion of the E. &amp;amp; W. divisions of the P. Ft. W. &amp;amp; C. R&apos;y, is much straighter than the eastern, the country being more flat.

THE LAKE SHORE AND MICHIGAN SOUTHERN RAILWAY.¹ From Conneaut, Ohio, to Edgerton, Ohio, with one branch from Elyria via Sandusky to a point eight miles east of Toledo, and another from Elyria via Fremont, Clyde, etc., to same point. The road in Ohio is double track from Elyria to Conneaut. From Elyria westward on the via Sandusky branch, a number of long sidings have been built and are still being constructed, which add to the length of double track. General Notes. Without attempting here to enumerate all the detailed information obtained from trustworthy sources and from personal observation, I do not hesitate to state that the high reputation of this railroad is well deserved, and based on substantial merits. The closer the inspection, the more evident this fact appears. The ruling principles, successfully applied in this road, appear to me to be the division of labor and unity of interest and responsibility; thorough discipline among its personnel and the highest order of intelligence and experience attainable on the part of those having direction of the affairs of its various departments, and furthermore, a constant endeavor to keep apace with scientific progress and invention in its field of operations without hindrance from narrow prejudices on the one hand, or impractical notions on the other. There may be railroads in Ohio equally well directed, managed, and equipped, but this does not detract from what is here stated of the Lake Shore. Personnel.

The Remarks. ditches are in good order; the ballast is the best quality of gravel. The road-bed is smooth. The fences are close to the track, and probably belong to the farmers. The ordinary stub switch is the one in use. These remarks apply to the road from Hamilton to Richmond, by way of Eaton. 4. Main Mine, from Hamilton to Dayton. north of Hamilton. The Miami river, at this point, many years ago, made a new channel No. 8, 2 miles for itself familiarly called New river. The bridge is over this new channel. By reason of a sharp curve in the stream a few hundred yards from the bridge, the tendency of the water, especially in freshets, is to strike against the south abutment. In the spring of 1881, the abutment was very much damaged, and the bridge rendered unsafe. Originally there were four long spans of Howe Truss. The crowding of the river toward the south has caused the channel under the north span to be left over dry land, except at the time of great floods. The bridge was really double; i. e., there were two, side by side. Since the destruction of the abutment, one side has been abandoned, and the new spans are iron structures, by Kellogg &amp;amp; Maurice; to be presently described. The two northern spans are heavy Howe trusses. The first span is the larger of the two, and is described below. One description may serve in general for both structures. This has 17 panels, of 10 feet each; is 14 feet wide in the clear, and North span. 23 feet high from center to center of chords. The counters are all 8 by 10 inches. The main braces run from 8 by 12 in the center panel, to 9 by 12 inches in the end panel. In the center there are three sus- pension rods, two of which have a diameter of 14 inches, and one of 1 inches. The rods increase by degrees up to the end of the second panel from the abutments, where the diameters are 2 and 1ğ inches, respectively. At the extremity of the first panel there are five rods, of which two have a diameter of 2 inches; two, 18; and one, 1 inches. The lower chord has four pieces, 7, 8, 8, and 7 by 15 inches; the upper chord has a depth of 13 inches. Upper and lower lateral tie-rods are 1 inches; the braces, 6 by 6 inches; timber. The floor beams are 7 by 14 inches; 5 to a panel. Track stringers, 14 by 16 inches. At the distance of 40 feet from each end, a double support, or yoke, has been put under the bridge for greater security. Flooring, 4 by 10 inches; 2 inches apart. The second span was of a like build, but was shortened 40 feet by Second span. the introduction of the two iron spans. What is left of it is also sup- ported by yokes. spans.

At Utica, Ohio, a fine cut stone arched culvert, of 10 feet diameter, made in 1872. No. 21, a queen-post inverted truss of 32 feet span, resting on tres- tle-bents, near banks, with short bank-spans; age, two years. Same construction as No. 177, near Sandusky, for the inverted queen-post. Nos. 22 to 34, inclusive, small openings. No. 25 being a trussed girder, about like No. 177; span of girder, 32 feet, with three panels, and a total depth of truss of 5 feet. At each side of trussed girder is a bank-span of trestling, one end of each span resting on a trestle-bent supporting girder, and the other end on the end of the bank or fill, without abutments. The bank-bearing is prepared for supporting the trestle-girder by first laying a course of half-length ties, and across these a sill or &quot;wall-plate,&quot; on which the trestle-girder rests. Thus, the structure consists of two bank-spans, a trussed girder-span, two trestle-bent supports and the bank-blocking. The foundation of the bents is broken stone piled into a trench. The bank-spans are fifteen feet, with girder-strings of two 8 by 16 inches, boxed, each. The trussed girder has lateral bracing, is between gird- ers, of 3-inch rods, and 4 by 6 struts, in Howe truss form, with angle- blocks. Pins of the main truss rods are 2 inches. The girders are three, 6 by 18 inches by 32 feet. The ties rest direct on the girders. A strong and well made structure, built in 1878, and the oldest of six like it on this division.

Neither is good material allowed to lie about on right of way to perish unused. The eye of the master of roads is observed to detect any good material lying overlooked by the section men or carpenters, and a word of instruction will be given to the responsible man at once. Yards are kept clean; rubbish is not allowed to accumulate. Bolts, nuts, washers, etc., found along the track are speedily picked up and gathered at section tool houses into scrap boxes. The fences are mostly of boards, but barbed wire is put in now as fences are renewed, though only six miles are now reported in Ohio. The company keeps up most of the fences, though on the Columbus and Newark Division it is, to some extent, the habit to allow the farmers to keep the fences where the road cuts their land. Some farmers abuse the privilege, however, by allowing the fences to run down where stock is but rarely allowed on the adjacent fields. In a few cases, they have been found to neglect their fences on the plea that they would prefer to lose a creature occasionally by the locomo- tive than be to the expense of maintaining a good fence. No farmer is allowed care of a fence, however, without a strict contract, and one that holds him responsible to the extent of all that he is worth for damages occasioned by neglect of fence. Some farmers have ignored the fence and cultivate close to the track. The right of way on the Central Ohio Division is 100 feet, and more where needed for cuts and banks. On the Columbus and Newark Division it is mostly 100 feet, though some portions are 66 feet only, and the same may be said of the L. E. Division. All of the Chicago Division in Ohio is 100 feet wide. On the Shawnee Branch it is from 50 to 100 feet, and averages about 66 feet. The ties on the Central Ohio Division are oak, 7 to 10 inches wide by 7 inches thick; length, 8 feet. Average duration, 8 years. The num- ber per mile which is standard is 3,000. Number laid since last year&apos;s visit, over one-fourth the whole number, as renewals. Cost of Ohio ties, 35 cents each, and range from 30 to 40 cents. The present condi- tion is good. No bad ties seen in the track. The Columbus and Newark Division uses oak ties, 7 to 12 inches wide, 7 inches deep, and 8 feet long. The average duration, 8 years, and the number per mile, 3,000. The number laid since last year&apos;s visit, 23,000. Average present cost, 35 cents. The present general condition is fine. The rails keep the line admirably. On the Lake Erie Division, the wood, dimension, duration and num- ber per mile same as last named. Number laid during the year, 73,650. Average present cost, 35 to 37 cents. General condition good; new ones are put in before old ones get bad. The Chicago Division in Ohio uses ties of white and Bur oak, mostly, though a few cedar ties are in use. Dimensions, not less than 7 by 8 inches, and up to 8 by 12 inches. Number, about 3,000, or, exactly, 2,975, which gives the standard number 17 to each rail length.

Maximum adhesive power of Locomotives is 35 per cent. of weight on Drivers. On comparing the amounts of tonnage in the above table, it will be observed that the tonnage actually hauled on some divisions is in excess of the theoretical quantity. This is caused by assuming 120 lbs. steam pressure in the formula for the tractive power, whereas practice ranges from 120 to 140 lbs. in boilers. &quot; &quot;234 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

About five miles of iron track are secured with the angle bar joint fastening. The switch adopted for all lines is stated to be the Lorens, though it is modified by omitting the safety spring, and by binding the link rods connecting the switch rails to lie below the ties. The spring frog is adopted as standard on all main lines. The whistle, bell, lamp, flag, semaphore at telegraph stations, tor- pedoes, and various forms of mechanical signals at railroad crossings. (See signal boards, etc., sketched above.) Red flag or lamp means dan- ger; and white, safety. Green light is sometimes used for safety signal at night, as on switches; blue means caution. Road has no block system. The trains are run by schedule, and a train dispatcher stationed at Newark. At telegraph stations a semaphore signal is worked by hand by the operator. A white semaphore signal at such stations means &amp;quot;no orders,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;go ahead;&amp;quot; red means &amp;quot;stop for orders.&apos; The station buildings are all in fair condition. Some have an old appearance, while others are new. The new are put in according to an adopted standard. (See notes above respecting station building at Norwich, east of Newark.) Attention is being given to the beautify- ing of stations by fencing in and cultivation of parks adjacent to the buildings and platforms. Emulation between different stations is caused by the presenting of prizes for the good appearance of station building grounds. For the heating of cars, a simple standard stove for wood, it being a box 12 inches wide, 18 inches high, and 23 inches from front to back. Inside is simply a box-except for the deflector, a horizontal plate about 8 by 10 inches, suspended directly under the smoke pipe, which latter goes up from a swell upon the middle of the top of the stove. The door is in the end, about 10 by 10 inches, and has hinges to the right, with a peculiar and simple lock, worked by the square end of the poker, which the brakeman has charge of. The bottom of the stove is sunk about 2 inches, and extends out front to form a cavity in the hearth, for admission of air. The hearth has a draught regulator. All stand on legs, and is bolted fast to the floor of the car by two in- verted U bolts going over the top and through the floor. On the floor is a sheet of zinc, and around between the stove and wood-work near, is set a sheet-iron screen. The Baker heater is now used to some extent. The lighting is mostly by mineral sperm oil, in lamps. The Miller platform and Janney coupler is used on all divisions. The air-brake is the Loughridge, not accessible to passengers. Wrecking tools are located and kept in readiness for use at Bellaire, Zanesville, Newark, Chicago Junction, Sandusky, and at Garrett, in Indiana. These consist of a derrick car, with heavy beams to anchor the car, so that it can lift a locomotive; also two cars accompany the derrick, containing jacks, chains, blocks, etc. &quot; &quot;780 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

General office at Canton, Ohio. Principal office in Ohio at Canton, Ohio. Address correspondence relating to this report to W. W. Hungerford, General Manager, at Canton, Ohio. HISTORY OF ORGANIZATION AND CONSTRUCTION. The Connotton Valley Railway Company was formed by a consolidation of the Connotton Valley Railroad Company and the Connotton Northern Railway Company. The consolidation agreement was entered into by the Directors of the two companies October 25, 1880, and approved by the stockholders November 8, 1880. The election of Directors of the consolidated company took place December 1, 1880. The Connotton Valley Railroad Company was incorporated under the general laws of Ohio by filing the certificate to build a railroad from Bowerstown to Youngstown, Ohio, the corporate name being the Youngstown and Connotton Valley Railroad Company. That com- pany purchased the Ohio and Toledo Railroad after it was sold at judicial sale, and at that time constructed from Dell Roy to Minerva. The purchasing company changed its route and terminus, making Canton the northern terminus instead of Youngstown, and by decree of court the name was changed to Connotton Valley Railroad Company. The Connotton Northern Railway Co. was incorporated under the general law by fil- ing its articles to build a road from Canton to Fairport Harbor, but the northern termi- nus was afterwards changed to Cleveland, when the road just named was built to Canton, and the second in course of construction as stated. In May, 1882, the Con- notton Valley Railway Company purchased the Connotton Valley and Straitsville Railroad, and are now extending the same to Coshocton. NAME, TITLE AND ADDRESS OF OFFICERS. Name.

Scarcely less valuable property and franchises than are held by it in Columbus are owned by this company in Toledo. These are the dock facilities, held in part by right of ownership and in part by perpetual leasehold, and extending from a point near the large iron bridge of the Northwestern Ohio Railroad down the Maumee river for a distance of 4,000 feet. They are of an average with of 400 feet. This space is now in great part covered with a most excellent system of side tracks, and will be entirely covered with them as fast as workmen can put them down. The best pattern of steam machinery for loading and unloading both cars and vessels is already in place. Among this there is, at this time, a number of revolving cranes, two traveling cranes- all run by steam power; three pits for unloading dump cars directly into the buckets, thus saving the labor of men in shoveling the coal. On every hand it appears that demands for additional facilities and contrivances for lessening labor and saving time are promptly met, as they arise, by the engineering department which has supervision of this work. A large building, capable of lodging and boarding sixty men, is also situated at one extremity of the ground owned by the company. Here workmen, employed about the dock and yards, may find shelter if they so desire. The railway company also own a tract of one hundred acres opposite the dock just described. It is on the right bank of the Maumee river, and has a frontage on this river of 1,800 feet. It is at present unde- veloped, being held in reserve for future requirements. Notwithstanding that freight is the principal business of the road, passenger traffic is by no means neglected. In this respect the equip- ment of the company is first class, and up to the standard of any road in the State. Three passenger trains pass daily in each direction over each division of the road, that of the Ohio River Division making direct connection at Logan with the train running from Columbus to Athens. In this respect it offers advantages to persons who have occa- sion to visit points on its line superior to those given by any other road terminating in or passing through Columbus. I mention this because it appears to me as being, to some extent, a concession to public con- venience. The administration of the affairs of the road is in the hands of men who have been with it from its very beginning. This is, to a large extent, true, not only of the officers, but al-o of train men, mechanics in the shops, and men employed in such like capacities. Although the road has changed owners since the date of last year&apos;s inspection, I find the same individuals in control of its various departments. Being wholly within the limits of the State, it depends entirely upon its own exertions and resources for its business. That these resources are being properly developed is unquestionable.

The short spans stand on columns of iron as at Cuyahoga, ex- cept at the east end, which has a stone abutment. One column stone pier has made some anxiety for its movement a few inches in the slip- ping bank. The main end panel truss rods of the deck 4-panel 60-foot spans are, two, 1 by 4 inch eye-bars, and bottom chord, two, 4 by 1 inches. Depth of the 4 spans of 60 feet is 15 feet for 3, and 10 feet for one span. Depth for the 30-foot span, 10 feet, and main truss links, two, 1 by 3 inches. Next to the large span they are, two, 1 by 3 inches. The 196-foot span is 25 feet depth of truss, 28 feet wide, has 14 panels of 14 feet each, and about 20 to 24 feet high over C. C. C. &amp;amp; I. track. This span has a pier prop at the fourth panel point similarly as in the Scranton avenue bridge, with continuous truss over it. Over pier is a large heavy column, etc., as at Scranton avenue. Truss double inter- section. The main truss rod at pier, two, 1 by 6 inches, 1 panel, and two, 1 by 6 inches, 2 panel length, both from top of the pier column. Next one in main truss, two, 13 by 5 inches.

SABINE, Commissioner of Railroads and Telegraphs: SIR: On the 2d and 3d inst. I made an examination of the railroads center. ing in Cincinnati, for the purpose of ascertaining their condition since the February flood. Most of the roads were injured to a greater or less extent. The Cincinnati and Eastern was covered with water for a long distance; but suffered little damage. Since my last report an excellent Howe Truss of two spans have been put over the Little Miami River. The Cincinnati, Georgetown and Portsmouth also has been under water for a couple of miles, and it has been necessary to cut away, in two places sev eral hundred feet of the long trestle, in order to allow the drift to pass down; but all has been put in excellent condition. The C, H. &amp;amp; D.; the O. &amp;amp; M.; and the C. I. &amp;amp; St. L. Roads showed no signs of injury to the track or bridges, The old M. &amp;amp; C., in the valley of Mill Creek, has been damaged in half a dozen places, the water cutting into the embankment on one or both sides, to the distance of 150 to 600 feet. At one point a track was undermined and a coach let down. At that point the roadway was saved only by a generous outlay of sandbags and work, I was at the point during the flood, and speak from personal examination and observation, But it was all right on the 3d inst. The Cincinnati Southern suffered most; about 400 feet of the broad embank- ment and the freight house being swept away, as also about 50 feet of the long trestle connecting this road with the others of the valley, But the whole space has been filled with strong piles, a double track put down, and a road- way over twenty feet wide, on piles, to take the place of the street, has been built in a very substantial manner. Within less than forty-eight hours from the time of highest flood the pile-driver was at work driving piles, which were ordered from the South to repair damages. It is hard to conceive of a more vigorous prosecution of work under difficulties. This work, too, I saw at the time, being present when the first pile was driven. In a word, I would say the roads are all in good condition, B. W. MCFARLAND, &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 413 and trussed with 2-inch rods. The cross ties on this are 6 by 8 inches, spaced 18 inches from center to center. There is an inner railroad iron guard rail, and an outer one of wood over this and the immediately adjacent, Four-arch stone viaduct, which is a fine structure and in an excellent Bridge No. 5, state of preservation. stone arch. Between the above and Clark&apos;s station are two short 3-span low tres- Trestles. tles, from 25 to 35 feet long, whose timbers and ties are in good condi- tion, but they have no guard rails. Near Chardon is a low (or half) Howe truss bridge, containing eight panels, each being 6 feet 6 inches long. The floor beams are 6 by 14 inches, two in each panel. The lower chords, 5, 9, 5 by 12 inches. It rests on good stone abutments. The track stringers, on which the iron rail rests directly (there being no cross ties, and consequently no guard rails), are single 8 by 12 inch oak. Height of truss, 7 feet 8 inches. The only preventive against spreading of the track on this bridge that I could observe, was a slight hold of the track stringers upon the floor beams, they being let into the latter to a depth of from to 1 inch. The timbers of this bridge appear to be in good condition. About 100 yards south of No. 5 is a 32-span trestle whose bents are at an average distance of 12 feet from center to center. Track string- ers are single, 10 by 12 inches. Cross ties, 6 by 7 inches, spaced 18 inches from center to center. The trestle is on a slight, about 14 degree It has no guard rail. The ground sills of the 4th, 5th, 9th and 10th bents from the north end, and the 11th and 12th from the south end, are much decayed. The right post of the 7th bent from the south end is also decayed at the bottom. The officers of the road assured me that this entire structure would be overhauled in less than two weeks. One mile north of Center Road Station is a low eight-panel Howe truss bridge, 50 feet long, and resting on stone masonry abutments. In style of construction, dimensions of parts, etc., it is like the bridge No. 6, near Chardon, already described. It is apparently in good order, as regards condition of its timbers. Like its counterpart, it has neither cross ties nor guard rails. curve. Bridge No. 6, (Howe, near half truss Chardon. Bridge No. 7, trestle. Bridge No. 8, low Howe truss. Bridge No. 9, Burton tres- tle, near East Claridon. Near East Claridon is the Burton trestle, 700 feet long, bents from 11 to 12 feet from center to center. Track stringer, 10 by 12 inches; ties, 6 by 6 inches, spaced 22 inches from center to center. No specific dan- gerous points were observed on this structure, but it needs overhaul- ing and repair. The work of overhauling and repairing this structure, which was under way last year, seems to have been abandoned, as I find it in much the same condition in which it was then. Following this is the Middlefield trestle, 715 feet long, which has Bridge No. 10, quite recently been completely overhauled and placed in good repair, all parts affected by decay being removed, and replaced by new sound. timber. Ties are also new, spaced 12 inches apart, and held in place by a 5 by 6 inch guard rail. In style of construction, dimensions of Middlefield trestle. &quot; &apos;434 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. Of the trestles on the road about 3,000 lineal feet in the aggregate have been filled with earth, and this work is still going on, being much facilitated by the employment of steam shovels for loading trains. An overflow, which took place in August, washed out several bridges on this road between Holmesville and Fredericksburg, and seriously damaged large sections of the track. These damages, which are now being repaired, checked, for a time, the work of laying track and bal- lasting on other portions of the road which would otherwise have gone on without interruption during the entire summer and fall. A general view of the work done since July, 1881, or rather since January 1, 1882, shows that there have been built and placed in posi- tion eighteen spans of new Howe truss wooden bridges and ten spans of iron plate girders, and that arrangements are perfected for adding five plate girders; that 3,000 lineal feet of trestle work have been filled, and all other trestles overhauled and strengthened. The management which took hold of this road, and is now controlling it, was, from the very beginning, fully alive to the requirements of the road, and recognized exactly what was wanted to make it a good stand- ard road for freight and passenger service, and pushed the work with such vigor that the results accomplished are surprising. The want of adequate terminal facilities in Columbus, and of side, switching, and passing tracks at nearly every important station on the road, is now being felt. This fact in itself is evidence that the atten- tion given by the management to the work of bringing the road up to a proper standard of safety and business capacity is being appreciated by the increased confidence of those who have business with it. The work of removing the shops to the new building provided for them years ago, at Mt. Vernon, is now under way. The buildings at the latter place are good, roomy, and substantial, and, when properly equipped, will afford facilities for making repairs and new construc- tions not surpassed by any that I have seen in the State.

For a full appreciation of the improvements that have been made in repair and renewal of structures, reference is made to the detailed re- port of bridges and trestles below. It will be perceived that all the bridges referred to last year as needing attention in various particulars, have been taken out and replaced with new ones, in wood or iron. Several of the trestles reported upon last summer have been filled up, and all others strengthened. Of the trestles on the road about 3,000 lineal feet in the aggregate have been filled with earth, and this work is still going on, being much facilitated by the employment of steam shovels for loading trains. Beginning at the southern terminus of the road, near Columbus, there is a trestle about 200 feet long, numbered 114. This has received a new floor, ties, stringers, and guard rail. Bents and sills in good condition. Trestles 113 and 112, between the above and Westerville, have been filled with earth. In trestle 109 the spans have been reduced one-half by intermediate bents inserted between the old ones, thus increasing its supporting capacity four-fold. Bridge 107, over Alum creek, half-way between Columbus and Wes- terville, is a new Howe truss, wooden structure on stone abutments. It has fourteen panels each, 11 feet 6 inches long. Depth of truss is 23 feet. Built by Smith Bridge Co., of Toledo, in 1882. Lower chord, 7, 8, 8, 7 by 16 inches; main braces at ends, four pieces 8 by 14 inches; second set, two pieces 11 by 13 inches; and so on to by 12 inches in center; counters 9 by 11-inch tie rods at ends, three, 2 inches di- ameter; second set, three, 2 inches; third set, two, 2 inches; and one, 13 inches; fourth, two, 23 inches; fifth, two, 2 inches; center two, 13 inches diameter. Floor beams 6 by 14 inches, six per panel; string- ers, two, 6 by 10 inches; ties, 7 by 8 inches, and 10 feet long; guard rail, 5 by 6 inches, and 8 inches from track. Trestle 94, near Galena, has been overhauled thoroughly, decayed sills, posts, and caps replaced with new timber, and length of spans reduced one-half by insertion of intermediate bents. Trestle 93-the long trestle approach to the crossing of Walnut creek-has also been built and renewed. Spans are reduced one-half by intermediate bents, sills taken out of ground and bedded on top of surface, many of the old ones having been entirely replaced by new timbers. A section of the guard rail on the west side of the south end is missing. Old Howe truss bridges, 92 and 91, over a public roadway and the creek, which form a part of this Galena bridge system have disap- peared, and in place of the former there is an iron plate girder 52 feet long, and the latter has been replaced by a new Howe truss deck bridge containing ten panels each 9 feet long, with 12 feet depth of truss.

New depot. Repairs. Station houses. Ironton. Ballast. Fencing. At Waverly is a new depot 80 by 26 feet. It is well arranged, com- modious and neat. The trestles numbered 53, 66, 102, 106, 108, 116, have all new tops; 67 and 117 are entirely new, the former has frame bents. From Sciotoville to the terminus at Petersburg. Three or four small, tasteful, appropriate station houses have been erected within the last year. At Ironton is a new freight depot 116 by 25 feet, having the office 16 by 25 feet; all of the very best. The track is pretty well ballasted with broken stone, all put on within the last twelve months. The track is nearly all fenced with wire, leaving a very narrow right of way. Every facility for full investigation into the condition of the road. has been given by the officers and men of the company, and that with a heartiness not surpassed by any in the State-and there has been a generous rivalry, so to speak, as to which road shall do the most for the accommodation of the State inspectors. VI. OHIO SOUTHERN DIVISION&apos; -- SPRINGFIELD TO JACKSON. 1. From Greenfield to Springfield. This road was originally a narrow gauge, but was changed to the common standard, without change of ties, except that about every eighth tie was replaced by one of requisite length. The original iron weighed, say 35 pounds per yard, but it is now being replaced with steel of 60 or 65 pounds, on ties of proper length, and the road bed is under proper improvement in width. The new rails are down (July 2) to a point two miles south of Charleston; the new iron and ties are dis- tributed all the way to Jeffersonville. I examined 23 trestles on the road, all good, and all unnecessary. They should all be replaced by earth. They range from four to ten feet in height, and occupy many hundred feet of the way.

Construction. Repair shops. IX. THE LAKE ERIE AND WESTERN RAILWAY,&apos; from Sandusky, Ohio, to Lafayette, Indiana, or to Fort Recovery, near the State boundary line. The road-bed is in fair condition generally, but some sections from Findlay to Lima are not good, either in ballast, ties, or track. From Sandusky out toward Fremont a large amount of work has been done in the way of ditching, solidifying and ballasting road with broken stone and gravel, and in building and repairing fences. Several new, neat, and convenient passenger stations have also been built; and changes under way last year at Sandusky in the re-arrangement of ter- minal facilities and better connections with Eastern lines, are com- pleted and in operation. The heavy freight business of this line ap- pears to come mostly from beyond the limits of this State, its business in Ohio being only of a local character. The departments of the road that would enable me to form a judgment of its terminal facilities at its source, were beyond my jurisdiction. The repair shops for the line in Ohio are in Lima. They are well located, excellently designed in the relation of their several depart- ments, and fully equipped with machinery for supplying all needed repairs, and even original work, in the way of freight and passenger cars. There is a unity of design in the location of the several build- ings and transfer tables which go to make up the shops, that facilitates in a marked degree their combined work, and tends to save time by lessening the amount of handling necessary in ordinary cases for the purpose of transferring articles undergoing repair or manufacture, from one shop to another. 1 Summary of Finances and Business.

Pleasant is in progress. A bridge accross the Ohio river is contem- plated. The abutment piers for this structure are nearly completed. All this, however, is only preliminary to the truly surprising devel- opment apparent in the terminal facilities of the road in Toledo, which are sufficient in extent to meet all exigencies of the shipping resources at the other end. For the grain trade several elevators (one now in course of completion having a capacity of 700,000 bushels) have direct relations to the road. For the coal, ore, and lumber trade the company owns one thousand and holds by lease five hundred feet of dock front on the Maumee river, just above the roadway bridge, which connects East and West Toledo. This dock is two hundred feet deep, and is even now almost entirely covered with a network of tracks and steam machinery for loading and unloading cars and vessels. It can be il- luminated at night with five electric lights, so that when necessary work can be carried on day and night, and the coal cars which roll in by hundreds may be quickly emptied, reloaded with lumber and sent back, leaving their loads at points along the way while en route to the coal fields for new loads of coal. To still further enable them to control the situation, and make room for an indefinite development of their resources, the management of the company has secured a number of vessels, which they call barges, and which will run in their interest on the lakes, between Toledo, Mil- waukee, Green Bay, Duluth, and other northwes.ern lake ports. I am informed that docks far exceeding in extent those the company now owns in Toledo, are in process of construction at Duluth and Milwau- kee. These are to serve as store-houses for the yield of coal during the season of navigation, in excess of local demand at Toledo and points drawing directly from the road, and will furthermore bring the coal fields of Ohio into direct relation with the markets of such places in the Northwest as St. Paul, Minneapolis, Duluth, and points on the Northern Pacific and the St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba railroads. From this detailed statement of facts gained from personal observa- tion and from sources of information which are worthy of confidence, the substantial character of the Ohio Central as a railroad enterprise, is apparent without argument or speculation. All measures necessary for safety appear to be taken in the construction and operation of the road. To maintain its position as a business road, will necessitate careful and unceasing attention to road-bed, ballast, and track, and wherever possible, easing of grade. With respect to width of embankments and cuts, many parts of the road need overhauling. The embankments especially are narrow, and unless built up and widened, cannot hold ballast properly. Some years of constant effort will probably be required to effect this fully. The nature of the country through which the road passes from Had- ley Junction to Corning, is such as to expose it occasionally to damage from floods, which even though they may be foreseen, cannot be &quot; &quot;BOWLING GREEN RAILROAD. 713 COST OF EQUIPMENT OWNED BY COMPANY. 2 locomotives, original cost not included....... 1 second-class passenger car, included in purchase. 1 baggage car, included in purchase.

The rapid substitution of iron for wood bridges now taking place here evinces a high rate of substantial improvement. For qualities of iron in these new bridges see last year&apos;s report. Quali- ties of iron in other bridges cannot be given. The embankments are usually 14 feet wide when prepared for the ballast and ties. At bridge approaches they are increased to 20 feet. In the ordinary gravel track the surface of bed and ballast is crowned from ditch to ditch. At summits the ditches at bottom are 18 feet deeper than the bottoms of the ties, and 7 feet wide from the ends of the ties out. Deeper and wider at points down grade from summits to provide for carrying water. The outside slopes of ditches are pref- erably sodded. Fences are chestnut posts and rail, 5 rails high, the rails being set into mortices through posts. Barbed wire is also favored, 5 wires high, on chestnut posts. Also 4 wires high and a top rail. Ballast is mostly gravel. Have fifty miles of furnace slag and mill cinder. Locomotive cinder is also used, and a considerable amount in track. Ties are white oak, chestnut and red oak, 6 by 8 inches and 9 feet long. Average duration, 8 years. Number per mile, 3,000. Number laid during past year, 198,903. Average present cost, 464 cents. Pres- ent condition in track, good. On some sharp curves, and at heavy grades and curves, a rail brace is put against the outside of the outside rail. At Vienna Junction is a reversed curve near, where speed is reduced. Trains are run by schedule and train dispatcher. Station buildings and platforms are in very good condition. The Company has a model station building at Cleveland. The fine, commodious waiting rooms are at the side, from which a roof extends out over the tracks, all in fine architectural design. See statement of buildings. Mineral Seal oil of 350° fire test is used in lighting cars. The Miller platform is employed. Each division has a wrecking derrick car with an attached caboose with tools. The Westinghouse automatic air-brake is in use here, with a cord through each car for setting it in case of accident. &quot; &quot;578 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. Name and how operated.

The fencing on all these narrow gauge new roads is yet in great No. 25. part to be built. The road east of Winchester is new; there is little or no ballast, and the rails are out of line and the surfacing is bad. From Winchester to Mt. Oreb, the track, in places, is pretty well ballasted; in others, it consists only of earth. The means of the company are expended in the extension of the road, and not in repairs. Still there is no special danger, when careful runs are made. Riding at the rate of 25 miles an hour, on the locomotive, in order to see how the road acted, I was but moderately shaken up. From Mt. Oreb to Batavia Junction the way is fully ballasted with excellent material; indeed the road is a fair road. The road is not fenced except by farm fences; and no attention is given to clearing the right of way beyond the ditches. The embankments are not numerous, and all are in good shape. The cuts are not deep, and are easily kept in order. General re- marks. Fencing. Embank- ments. Cuts. Length. Work. The main line extends 70 miles from Cincinnati, the Richmond branch is 15, and the Hillsboro&apos; line 19 miles. Gangs of hands were at work where most required; and it seemed to me that the authori- ties are exerting themselves with remarkable diligence to extend and complete their line, and keep up the part already open to the public. The ties number from 2,600 to 3,000 to the mile; are 6 inches thick, Ties. with surface bearing from 7 to 11 inches; and all new ties are 8 feet long, many thousands having been put in within a year. This branch is about in the same condition as it was last year, the company agreeing only to keep it in such condition as when first taken in charge. This is well ballasted through almost the whole distance. The align- ment is good; the surfacing better than that on the main line. There are many curves of short radius, and a large numbers of trestles, some of which are several hundred feet long; 10 of them varying from 20 to 35 feet in height. With two exceptions they are all in good condition. The Hillsboro&apos; . branch. Richmond branch. &quot; &quot;AMERICAN DISTRICT TELEGRAPH COMPANY OF HAMILTON COUNTY.

Living dan- ger signals. General char- acter of track structures. Iron bridges. with a watch-house, in which is stored the means for ridding the track of passable lodgments, such as flags, lanterns, spades, bars, jumper drill, powder, fuse, etc. In long cuts on curves a man is stationed at each end. In emergencies the men combine from the neighboring cuts to hurry off the big stones, etc. In case of a downfall upon the track, flags or lanterns are hurried out to signal danger to trains. These precautions are in force at cuts near Barnesville and Somerset. In case of such danger signals as the above, or at other unusual signaling points, as in the repair of roads, a stake flag, or hanging lan- tern is not depended on. The signal must be a living one, a man with the flag or lantern. As to the general character of the track structures of this road on the Central Ohio division, we find more bridges per mile than on other divisions. Very few trestles are found here. The bridges are not large on this division, but there are many varying from 50 feet to 150 feet. On the Shawnee branch there are quite a large number of trestles, and two of large size. On the Columbus and Newark division are few trestles of any size. On the Lake Erie division, especially north, there are quite numerous culverts of 4 to 12 feet opening, and trestles of two or three spans; also several quite large iron bridges. On the Chicago division there were a great many small trestles, but these have been largely filled, about three-fourths of them with a tile opening, within the past year, a fact which is greatly to the credit of the road. The structures on this division differ more in size than on any other; that is, the country being nearly flat, occasions many ditches and small waterways and runs. One peculiarity of the country here in western Ohio, is that its general flatness is occasionally inter- rupted by deep gorges and rivers of considerable size, thus requiring a few large bridges. Most of the small trestles have no abutments, the banks sloping to- ward the center. An extended bearing on the banks is secured by bedding timbers, sometimes a solid course of ties on the tops of the banks, though usually the bedding sticks are half ties. On these the wall plates or sills are laid, for receiving the ends of the main stringers. These apparently often settle when blocks are placed under to fill up. When the blocking amounts to a large 12-inch block or sill, the small blocks are replaced by the large one. Though the road throughout is found in good condition, and safe, yet some portions are kept up to a higher point of excellence than others. This is true of the main line through to Chicago, for that part examined, viz., Bellaire to Newark, Newark to Chicago Junction, and thence to the State line west. All costly iron structures are on this line, and it has many fine ones. The fact that quite a number of costly iron bridges were found in the process of erection, indicates that the road is still active in the line of improvements. Iron bridges are all of the Pratt and Bollman type, and all have pin bearings. Perhaps one or two exceptions should be made for plate girders. No iron trestles were found. On this line is also found a large quantity of first class &quot; &quot;958 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. Name. DIRECTORS. Residence. Name. Residence. Thos. D. Messler Wm. Thaw Geo. B.

The only iron structures on this branch of the Pennsylvania Co.&apos;s Structures. lines are the five large and fine Pratt truss bridges over the Maumee river at Toledo. The west span, which was carried away by the flood of 1880-1, has been recovered for the greater part, piece by piece, by the aid of divers. This material has been put in shape for re-erection, and new added where necessary, so that the missing span is now at the time of the visit, being returned to place. During the past year many improvements have been made along the line, and are still going on. The pile trestle bents are being larely re- newed in framed bents, by cutting off the piles, and planting the framed bents upon them. This makes an admirable foundation for the new bents. Improve- ments. The Howe bridges are being strengthened by temporary supports Bridges. and by new posts. These have never been covered, for which reason the sap-wood has decayed, giving to these bridges a bad ap- pearance, but where examined the heart wood has been found sound. This, together with the comparatively light rolling stock and traffic, and the moderate speed, may account for the freedom from casualty here. In some of the bridges the sap-wood is in an excessive per centage of section. road. There appears to be a good force of section men on the line. Their Repairing time, however, apparently is largely occupied in doctoring the old iron rails, the line being still over 80 per cent., or 57 miles, in 56-pound rails. When steel is laid, the displaced iron is at once used to better the remaining iron. The rails are thus used up very close, a pile of spent rails having pieces down to four or five feet length, some of such lengths being indeed now seen in the track. When a portion of a rail becomes badly mashed it is often cut out and a piece taken from the &quot; &quot;154 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. No. 40. Remark.

In all essentials a copy of 35 above given (which see). The west approach has 21 panels of trestle, about 20 feet high on an average. The east approach has 12; all good. The floor has ties 5 by 8 inches, all notched on the stringers, and are only 8 inches apart. The ribbons also are properly notched. Both the bridges, 35 and 40, have been strengthened by two pile bents under the span at suitable distances from the end. 5. Main Line, from east of Winchester to Sardinia. The road from Sardinia to Winchester was examined from the east toward the west, and the following structures therefore are in reverse order. Here is a long and very high trestle, being 64 feet at the highest point; at which place in the structure there is a 40-foot trussed girder, having three 2-inch rods on each side, extending 5 feet below the bot- tom of the stringers, which are 10 by 16 inches, and double. The or- dinary stringer is 6 by 16 inches. The ribbons are 6 by 7 inches, notched and bolted. The floor consists of ties 8 feet long, 5 by 7 inches, and at intervals of 6 inches. The eastern part of the trestle has 14 bents of the usual 4 post arrangement, and at the highest point is 25 feet above ground. The central part has 22 panels of the usual length, 18 feet, near the middle of which the trussed girder is placed. The high part is very strongly braced, both laterally and longitudinally. To the westward are 10 more bents in the usual form, but not so high; just completed. Is another trestle of 3 spans, and 20 feet high; new and strong. Another of 22 spaces, 25 feet at highest point, and all first-rate. This road is fairly ballasted, from the Junction to Williamsburg, and a short distance further. At irregular intervals also the track has patches of ballast; but over half the way it is only earth ballast. In these portions therefore the track is wanting in solidity, and the sur- facing and alignment are consequently in rather bad condition. But work in ballasting is progressing rapidly, the company owning as fine a gravel bank as any in the State. Three panels, eight feet high; and then three more, from 20 to 25 feet high. 23 spans, 40 feet high at the highest point, made of 10-inch timbers. Floor, ribbons, and stringers in the usual good style. Eighteen panels, from 20 to 25 feet high. Each of 3 panels, and 10 feet high; one over a roadway. The first, 3 panels, 7 feet high; the second, 5 panels, 8 to 10 feet high, and both are openings for water. 3 panel water way. Nine panels, from 16 to 18 feet high.

The timbers of the bridge were sounded, last year, with a boring bit and found to be sound. Though then 11 years old, the fact of its hav- ing been covered within one year after erection, appears to have pre- served it, by preventing incipient &amp;quot;dry rot.&amp;quot; The wall plates through- out appear to have been overlooked, are weak with decay and crushing down. Need immediate renewal, which, it is stated, will be done at Otherwise the bridge is in fair condition, though it is light for the heavy engines now used, except for the trestles under, which have been put in during the past year.

The Sixty-fifth General Assembly of Ohio appropriated twelve lars for the inspection of the bridges and railways of Ohio. Professor R. W. McFarland, S. W. Robinson, and Lieutenant George Ruhlen, all of the Ohio State University, were again selected as experts for the discharge of this duty. Each one reviewed the roads under his respective charge the year previous. The railways more recently opened were apportioned them as will appear in their several reports. The observations of the Inspectors were more general than heretofore and a more particular account of each railway has been made. The date given in the report of inspectors, except in the very few instances mentioned to the contrary, were obtained by actual measurements taken in the tours of inspection. In order to extend the examinations to all the bridges of all the roads of the State, some means of quick transit from bridge to bridge was necessary. This has been cheerfully provided by the various railroad companies. In each case a special train, accompanied by officers of the road, was placed at the service of the inspectors, and stops were made at any bridge desired. Sidings were not always convenient for the special to dodge into and hence long stops at in- dividual bridges was impracticable. This explains the absence of data from many bridge records required for completeness of record from an engineering stand point. In a number of cases bridges which seemed to require special attention were subsequently visited without a &quot;special&quot; and time given for a more complete record. But even in such cases figures respecting all the details have not been attempted. The Commissioner has caused a foot-note to accompany the inspection report of each railway, in which will be found a summary of the finance and business of the same for the current year. This will enable the reader to secure a general view of the physical, financial and business condition of each road in close association. More extended ac- counts of finances and business will be found in the official reports of the com- panies in the latter part of the volume. 5 &apos; &quot;566 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

The largest portion of traffic appears to be of timber and lumber on this portion of the road. Traffic. dition. The ballast is defective and deficient, and the rails are full of short General con- bends, several within a rail length, due to yielding of bed and ballast as the trains are run over. Near Van Wert these defects of track are slight, and they will be made less throughout as the track is worked upon and trimmed up to line. Creeks are all nearly dry in the sum- mer season, but in the spring the country is wet, and, to some extent, swamp-like. The wet weather during the spring and early summer made bad work for the new portion of this road north of Van Wert.. Gravel ballast is difficult to obtain, so that, as yet, the bed has been made as high, dry, and solid as could reasonably be expected by ditch- ing and raising of bed. In ordinary weather this makes a good bed, but here the excessively wet weather of a few months past has so soft- ened the bed that the ties in places have gone down out of sight. In this sinking of track, the numerous solid stump roots in the bed have resisted the depression, so that the track rails have become badly bent. But the energy of the company seems never to weary, and the road is strung with men trimming the track up to surface again. The engines used here weigh 42 tons, with about 21 tons on the drivers. The regular section gangs consist of two south of Van Wert and three north. The right of way averages about 60 feet, some being 30 feet and some 100 feet. The line is about one-fourth fenced with board and rail. The fence new put up is of barbed wire, three miles of this being now up. The ballast is such as is obtained along the way. No gravel. Ties are mostly White oak, though some are Black ash; from the roadside timber for experiment. They are 6 inches thick, 8 inches face, and 8 feet long, but are accepted from 7 to 12 inches face. They are laid 2,640 per mile, or 2 feet c. to c. The number laid since last year is 34,000. They cost about 25 cents each, and are obtained from the adjacent timber. &quot; &quot;1138 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. EARNINGS, OPERATING EXPENSES, ETC., FOR YEAR ENDING JUNE 30.

A standard tie has 8 inches face for the rail seat, and is 7 inches thick. Distance between ties when laid, stated to be 15 inches. The standard joint is the suspension joint, at a space between ties of 10 inches, the joint ties being placed closer than others. Joints opposite or alternate without adhering to either. The standard weight of rail is 60 pounds per yard, except on curves at heavy grades on the E. Division, where, when renewed, the rails are now made 67 pounds per yard. Some of the old iron is 56 pounds. The standard rail has a head slightly convex to radius of 10 inches Rail. at the top, and rounded at the top corners to a radius of inch. The sides slope from a width of 2 9-32 inches at a distance down of .46 inch to a width of 23 inches at a distance down from crown of 1 inch. The under sides of the head are inclined at an angle of 12 degrees with the horizontal. The outer lower corners are rounded to a radius of inch, and inner corners next to the stem with a fillet to radius of 5-16 inch. Distance from crown of rail head to intersection of the lines of the in- clined undersides, 1 27-64 inches. The stem is concave to a radius of 12 inches, and inch thick at the thinnest point, the middle. Fillet between stem and foot to a 5-16-inch radius.

The elevation of outer rail on curves is stated to be inch per de- Elevation of gree of curvature for the Eastern Division. For the Western Division it is stated at 2 inches for a 5-degree curve, or inch per degree of curvature. On the last named division it is held that the elevation should be made moderate, and that it is liable to be too great. It should not be so high that the train will wander from side to side across the clearance between wheel flanges and rails, as it is likely to do if made just to the theoretical value. It is preferred to keep the flanges pressing outward against the outside rails slightly, thus keeping the train steady, and also confining the principal part of the wear to the outside rail, and on the side of the head. Then the ouside rails, after considerable wear, are put to the lower side, and the lower ones to the higher side of curve, thus wearing all the rails on both sides. The life of ties is stated to be increased by use of stone ballast. For instance, in ordinary ballast it is found to average six years. From four years&apos; experience on stone ballast it is estimated to be eight or ten years, an increase of about 50 per cent. The heaviest locomotives, except as above stated for the E. Division, are stated to weigh 50 gross tons, or 112,000 pounds, when charged and on track ready for service. Length, point of pilot to buffer, 56 feet. A passenger coach weighs about 23 tons, and carries about 50 passengers. By actual measurement, the length of an ordinary coach is 56 feet, average of 3 cars; a Pullman car, 61½ feet, 1 car; a bag- gage car, 464 feet, 3 cars averaged; a United States postal car, 56) feet.

I am informed that forty-two cargoes of ore ranging from 1,000 to 2,700 tons have been in the docks on a single day. Near Ashtabula a number of sheds with elevated tracks have been built for coaling engines. In the vicinity of Cleveland, and about four miles east of the union depot, there are on each side of the main lines ten sets of parallel side tracks, each sufficient in length to hold 65 freight cars. This is the shifting yard-the tracks on one side being intended for east and those on the other for west bound freight. These afford a great relief to the overcrowded yards in the city of Cleveland. Changes are in progress there also, which, if successful, will result in giving the road a dock-front and outlet to the lake at a point west of the union depot. The ground owned by the road in the city, although large in extent and extremely valuable, is altogether inadequate for the proper transaction of the business of the road, as developed within the past few years. Extensive changes are under way in Toledo, which, when accom- plished, will result greatly to the benefit of the road. A new building for a passenger station is in process of construction, at a distance of half a mile or more from the old union passenger depot. It is on a continuation of the main line of the L. S. &amp;amp; M. S., and through trains will save from twenty to thirty minutes time over present arrange- ments in Toledo. The territory owned by the company between the present union depot and the new one, referred to as being built, will be given up to side tracks for freight shifting yards. Plans of the buildings to be erected, together with their relation, as regards location, to the various needs of the public, give the impression that the result of the work contemplated will be very creditable to the railroad com pany. The principal repair and construction shops for the road in Ohio are in Cleveland and Norwalk. The shops in Norwalk, though not of great extent, are well equipped with machinery, every available space in the building being closely occupied. The principal repair shop, more es- pecially for locomotives and cars, is, I am informed, in Elkhart, In- diana. 1. Main Line, from Conneaut westward via the northern division to State line.

It is of the standard gauge, but light in construction, intended only for passenger traffic, being a suburban railroad. A low Howe truss bridge, at Euclid, is old and in a dilapidated con- dition. Recent renewal of, or rather additions to, its lower chords, make it reasonably safe for the present, but the rapid decay of the upper chord and web members indicate that further repairs and re- newals are desirable. It rests on good stone masonry abutments. The floor beams, track stringers, and ties are in good state of preservation. There are no guard rails. No. 1. The western approach to the above bridge is a 28-span trestle, whose bents are 16 feet from center to center. The bents are 10 by 10 inch timbers, consisting of sill, cap, one center plumb and two exterior batter posts, braced laterally by two, 2 by 10 inch planks spiked to posts, and longitudinally from bent to bent in same manner. The track stringers are three 6 by 12 inch pieces under each rail. The ties 3 by 6 inch planks, from 2 to 3 inches apart. There are no guard rails. Timbers are all in good condition. No. 2. The next structure from the last mentioned, going toward Cleveland, is a 2-span bridge, resting on stone masonry abutments and intermediate timber bent support. Each span is 40 feet long, and con- sists of a trussed beam, having three pieces, each 6 by 12 inches, trussed with two 14-inch iron rods. There is on this structure a light inner railroad iron guard rail, but no outer one. The ties are 3 by 6 inch plank, placed 2 inches apart. 1 Summary of Finances and Business.

The top chord is but an exten- sion of the post, for the first panel at the top; the next panel has a cover 7-16; the third, 8-16; the fourth, 9-16 inch thick. The lower chord in the double panel at the end consists of two bars, 6 by 13 inches; the third panel, four bars, 6 by 1 3-16 inches; the fourth panel, six bars, 6 by 1 1-16 inches; the fifth panel, six bars, 6 by 18 inches.. The largest pins have a diameter of 5 inches; the others, 5 inches. The suspension bar in the double panel is 8 by 1 inches, and is fast- ened to the cross beam by 22 rivets, inch; the floor beams having 15 rivets, inch. The post at the end of the double panel consists of two channel bars, 12 inches, with flanges, 3 inches; thickness, 9-16 inch, set at a clear interval of 11 inches, and braced by the usual method of &quot;lacing;&quot; the lace strips are 2 by inches, and rise 16 inches from end to end. The second post has its channel bars 10 inches, 2 inch flange, and 7-16 inch thickness; the third and fourth differ only in being of 5-16 inch iror. The tie bars in the second panel are double, 6 by 1 inches; the third, 6 by 15-16 inches; the fourth, 6 by 14 inches; the fifth, 5 by 14 inches. The counter-bar in the middle panel is round, and is 2 inches diameter; the rod in the next panel is 13 inches. The top lateral rods are square, and vary from 1 to 13 inches. The ties constituting the floor are 7 by 8 inches, placed at 4 inches interval. The floor beams are plates, 36 inches by 11-16, having a top plate, 12 by inches; bottom plate, 13 by inches, strengthened by double angle irons at top and bottom, 3 by 5 inches, having 60 rivets at top and 60 at bottom. The stringers are similarly constructed, but of smaller dimensions; depth, 20 inches; upper and lower angle irons, 5 inches by §; making the total width about 11 inches. The lower lateral bracing in the first panel consists of two square bars, 2 inches; the second, 2 inches the third, 13 inches; the fourth, 19-16 inches; the fifth is single and 1 3-16 inches. The upper laterals consist of two angle irons, set at right angles to the length of the bridge; their dimensions were not measured. The south abutment consists of tube piling, 7 feet in diameter, sunk to the depth of 20 feet below the bed of the river. The tubes are filled with 15-inch piles, driven 20 feet further into the bottom, concrete filling in the space to low water. Two courses of 12-inch timber are bolted to these piles, and then the tubes from low water mark are filled to the top with dressed stone, making an abutment as secure as it possi- bly can be made. The pier is made square, 7 by 8 feet, and is sunk 24 feet, and filled in the same manner as the tubes of the abutment. Howe Truss, 2 spans; total length, 365 feet.

Half Howe truss, 9 feel high, similar to No. 9 preceding, 73 feet long, and light. Is a duplicate of No. 15. There is a trestle of 13 bays, each 24 feet; total, including the shorter bays, 335 feet. It is about 22 feet bigh, similar to the struc- ture at Sidney. North of Columbus Grove is a small Howe truss, like No. 15, above. Howe, 12 panels, 10 feet each; total, 130 feet. Rods in threes, from 1 to 2 inches; the main braces are from 8 by 12 to 10 by 12 inches; the counters are 8 by 9 inches; the chords are 12 and 14 inches deep, respectively, have four pieces, of which two are 7 and two 8 inches broad; the structure is 14 feet broad, 22 feet high, and stands 25 feet above the water; the masonry is good; the approaches at the ends are of the same length, each 102 feet, consisting of 3 bays, 24 feet each, and two 15 feet, and supported as others on this road. Thirty-eight miles from Toledo there is a small Howe truss, in all respects like Nos. 15 and 16, above given. On the east side of the Maumee the road has erected a first-class elevator, capable of storing 750,000 bushels. The ties on this road are 8 feet long, and 8 by 7 inches, and run from 2,600 to 2,800 to the mile. For 50 or 60 miles from Dayton, from 150 to 250 first-class new ties per mile have either been put in or are now ready. The track, ditches, ballast, fences, etc., are very much like the corresponding items on the C. H. and D. road; this remark applies to the road as far as to Sidney. From this place to Lima the track is not so good; the surfacing is in many places bad, the ballast insufficient in quantity, and the fences rarely encroach on right of way, but the old ties are not yet gathered up. South of Sid- &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 399 the iron bridges are remarkable for simplicity. and evince a high de- gree of fertility of design on the part of the bridge engineers. The roadway is mostly in embankment or raised above the general Roadway. surface, the object being to keep the water well away from the track, 90 per cent. of the whole line, it is stated, being thus in embankment. The old practice of balancing excavation embankments has been ignored here, and a plan of wasting and borrowing adopted for the most part. Judgment has been used in this matter with a view to the economy of construction. The fact that excavation costs more per cubic yard than embankment of borrowed earth, has been constantly kept in view here. This fact alone would raise a road to some extent into embank- ment. This road has very mild grades throughout. As stated by the Chief Grades. Engineer, J. A. Latcha, the maximum grades in this State are, east- ward, 21 feet per mile, and westward, 31 feet, and for the whole line of over 500 miles, it is only 31 feet per mile eastward, and 45 feet west- ward. This road is also one of long tangents, many, it is stated, being over 30 miles, and the curvature of the whole road being only 5 per cent., and of long radius. The line has been located through such country as requires but very little curvature for avoiding hills and heavy ob- structions. The location appears to have been not with a view of striking certain towns, but to obtain the most favorable conditions for heavy traffic over a long line. These excellent features can not fail to give this road strong points of advantage over its competitors. The divisions of the road are as follows: 1st division-Buffalo to Conneaut, 115.50 miles. 2d 3d 4th 66 Conneaut to Bellevue, 132.35 miles. Bellevue to Ft. Wayne, 122.77 miles. Ft. Wayne to Chicago, 153.11 miles. In Ohio there are only 2 miles of the first, all of the second, and 104.73 of the third; in all 239 miles. Divisions. The passing side tracks are 4,000 feet long and eight miles apart for Side tracks. the standard arrangment. All sidings have new rails. The standard flooring requires that the ties be 7 by 8 inches, and laid 16 inches c. to c. Wood guard rails are notched one inch on the ties. On bridges with curved tracks, the elevation of outer rail is re- quired to be inch per degree. The camber line of pins is required to be 1-1200, and of the track 1-2400 of the span. Wind strains are calculated for a pressure of 30 lbs. per square foot for all members of each truss, and for 10 square feet of train surface per lineal foot on bridge. The rolling load to provide for in bridge calculations is two engines, coupled each, in working order, weighing 66 tons, in a space of 100 feet, and of a train load of 20 tons to 22 feet. The drivers of each en- gine to be allowied 36 tons in a space of 12 feet. Flooring. &quot; &quot;1548 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. OTHER INDEBTEDNESS AND STOCK AND DEBT.

But the south half is through dense swamp land, where Parson&apos;s story of the Mosquito comes nearer to being realized than anywhere else. The road bed is but little raised, and the ditches from which the filling is taken are very irregu lar, and at the time of the visit nearly brim full of water. Under these circumstances the road bed could hardly be otherwise than very soft and yielding, and the rails were terribly kinked by the irregular sinking of the ties. The right of way appears to be indefinitely defined, as though that Riggt of way, and the surrounding swamps belonged to one company. The country is so very flat here that it appears next to impossible to drain the ditches. There are no fences on the south half, but the north half is largely between highway fences, the highway and railway being side by side. The ballast for the north half is already stated. For the south half it is simply of swamp soil. The ties are mostly black ash; some oak, about 7 by 8 to 10 inches, and 8 to 8 feet long. Laid about 2,800 per mile. The cost is only that of cutting and carrying about 300 feet for the greater part of the road. Present condition of the ties, fair. The rails are all 35 and 56 lbs. per yard; iron. The 35 lb. was formerly the rail, but recently the track has been nearly all re-laid in 56 lb., and these are still going down on the south part near Paulding. The joints are secured by fish-plates, those on the new being the Samson&apos;s. The stub switch is used. Trains run by schedule and time-pieces. No costly bridges are required; a small draw over a canal near Cecil being the largest; one span of about 18 feet. Rail to water, 8 feet. Wood girder beams are swung by guys to posts at the south side. The two beams are connected by jointed rods, so that there can be a hinge at end of each girder beam, the two working together like parts of a parallel rule.

The trestle work is mostly on piles, well braced transversely and long- itudinally, and like the bridges surmounted by a good floor system of strong, closely laid ties and outside guard rails. Several of the older trestles, which need renewal, are now being filled in with earth, and one is being in part filled and in part replaced with an open truss bridge. Like all other roads, the Ohio Central has suffered from the long, wet spring and early summer, which not only prevented work on the road- bed, but proved destructive of much that was done last year, by wash- ing down and narrowing embankments, and filling cuts and ditches, and &quot;wearing&quot; the ballast, which, in connection with the constant heavy freight traffic, has thrown the track out of line and surface. notwithstanding this the road is now in better general condition than it was a year ago, and it is evident that the deficiencies mentioned are receiving attention. The ties as a rule are good. There are many points of interest in the management of this road which give evidence of a far-sighted and far-seeing policy that, if con- tinued in the spirit in which now carried on, will result in making the Ohio Central prominent among the railroads of the State. The first, in a strictly railroad point of view, in this series is the comprehensive system of repair, and, I might justly say, construction shops belong- longing to the road, and located at Bucyrus. Here the company has facilities for making not only all necessary repairs of worn and broken machinery and equipments, but even can, in case of necessity, make its own locomotives. I am informed that two new ones have already been made here, and a number of others which had been destroyed in accidents, have been virtually rebuilt. The arrangement and gen- eral design of the different buildings constituting the system of repair shops is admirably adapted to the purposes for which it is intended, and very creditable to the designer. The power is supplied by an en- gine and a battery of two large tubular boilers. In addition to the local resources for freight and passenger traffic enjoyed by this line equally with other roads in like circumstances as re- gards location, it has at its back the Ohio Central Coal Company, which, from present indications, is an organization which will do much to in- sure the future success of the road as a business enterprise. With Corning and its vicinity as a central point, it is extending its operations and control over a vast extent of country in the coal regions; and no sooner do new developments of coal fields appear than the railroad creeps along, like the root of a thrifty plant, continually feeling for and following paths in the soil that afford it nourishment. In this way the road has within a year crawled through, among and around the hills and ravines of Perry and Athens counties for a distanee of eighteen miles beyond Corning, although the present terminus is less than three miles from there. In addition to this, it has pushed out at several points short spurs or coal branches, which will soon contribute their regular daily supply of coal freight to the road.

From Nos. 2 to 3 is a fill of about 600 feet length in the broad river bottom. Apparently one opening is needed at this stream. These structures are of ample strength. General Remarks. The surface of the country along the line is quite even and flat, so that no heavy cuts or fills are required. Bridges and trestles are not high. The actual roadway is almost without cuts or fills, and with com- paratively heavy grades, so as to skip along the surface of the country. The rails first put down on the full gauge were 45 pounds per yard, with fish-plate fastenings, 4 bolts, and no lock-nuts. Where the track is regarded as finished, the rails are spiked at every tie. From this on, the new rails will be 56 pounds per yard, and of the so-called Sandbery pattern. The section of the 45 pound rail is 3§ inches high, the head &quot; &quot;VALLEY RAILWAY.

Vernon and Delaware Railroad. ¹ 1 No road in the State that came under my observation this summer shows such marked improvement as does this. In addition to the work done on the structures to make them secure for the traffic of the road, extensive improvements of a permanent character have been made. These are all of a high standard of strength, and superior in design and manner of construction to structures of the same kind and for the same service which were made a few years ago; thus recognizing in advance the requirements of the continually increasing weight of en- gines and freight loads. The road-bed, as a rule, is solid, well banked, and substantial, with sufficient width on top for supporting ties and ballast. Ditches have received good attention, and show that in the rush of seemingly more important work that has been crowded upon them, the officers of the road have not neglected this first and indispensable requisite of a solid road-bed. The road bed is generally well ballasted with gravel, being greatly improved in this respect since last year. The most marked improvement, and one which must strike the eye of any one who noticed the condition of the road last summer, is the condition of the track and road-bed as regards its comparative smooth- ness, due mainly to the fact that about twenty per cent. of all the ties have been renewed, the worst of the old track taken out and replaced with fifty-six pound steel rail, laid with angle bar joints. Three thou- sand tons of these have already been laid, and more is at hand and ready to go down. Only a few sections, aggregating six miles in length, of the old chair iron remain on the entire road. The prospect was this 1 Summary of Finances and Business. Cleveland, Mt. Vernon and Delaware Railroad (Receiver): Mileage, owned..

Also, employes made up 46 per cent. of killed, and &quot;others&quot; 53 per cent. Perhaps this apparent increase is partly due to the com- panies making more complete returns of accidents for the past year or two than heretofore. Of the passengers injured, so far as reported, 34 per cent. were due to causes beyond their own control, and 66 per cent. were from misconduct or want of caution. Of the passengers killed, 33 per cent. were due to causes beyond their control, and 67 per cent. from misconduct or want of caution. Of the employes injured, 26 per cent. were due to causes beyond their con- trol, and 74 per cent. from misconduct. Of the employes killed, 39 per cent. were due to causes beyond their control, and 61 per cent. from misconduct or want of caution. Of the &quot;others&quot; injured, 58 per cent. were trespassing, 24 per cent, were at stations or highway crossings, and 18 per cent. were stealing rides. Of the “others” killed, 61 per cent. were trespassing, 19 per cent. at stations and highway crossings, and 20 per cent. stealing rides.

Rods, 1 to 18 inches, and occur by twos. Five years old; seems sufficiently strong; 16 feet above water. Two spans, of 60 feet each, in all respects like No. 26. At the west side is a frame trestle, 60 feet long, in good condition; 13 feet high. Then follow three short frame trestles, 8 or 10 feet high, and need- ing no further mention. Half truss, Howe; like No. 26 in all essential points; 14 feet above water. Same as 25. Iron bridge. Kellogg &amp;amp; Maurice pattern; 5 panels, 18 feet each; 19 feet above water. Howe truss; usual height and breadth, and size of iron and tim- bers---the dimensions of which are given in the original notes; 23 feet high. Half Howe Truss, 48 feet long, having solid chords, and usual weight of timbers; is 12 feet above the stream. Same as the preceding, except it is a deck bridge; 24 feet high. Low Howe Truss, 62 feet long; is old; has been lately repaired to some extent, but needs more. Like the preceding; is 27 feet high. Bridge over the Scioto, at Circleville. In preliminary report marked &quot;A,&quot; all the points necessary to give will be found. The two middle spans have been renewed, and all good except the west span. The new spans have 4 chord pieces, 8 by 14 inches; floor beams of same size, and five to a panel. The track stringers are double, and 6 by 12 inches. The main braces are double, and range from 10 by 12 to 64 by 10 inches; the counters run from 7 by 8 to 8 by 11 inches. The suspension rods are by threes, and vary from 13 to 24 inches. The width is fourteen feet in the clear, 214 feet high, from center to center. The flooring is good; and the rails are 31 feet above the ordinary stage of water. The river works hard to spoil the east abutment, and at one time came out nearly ahead, but the abutment is now fairly well protected. Canal bridge old and bad, to be replaced immediately; timber al- ready on hand for the purpose, but not done in July, 1882. Then follow three trestles of 60 feet span; total, in four bents; good, and need no further mention. Deer creek; two spans, covered deck. Each span is supported at the points by framed yokes or supports, which are ballasted with heavy rock. The structure is old, and should be rebuilt at once. Each span is 160 feet long, and has 14 panels, with timbers lighter than is or should be now used, considering the increased weight of locomotives and freight cars. The east approach is 77 feet long, and should be replaced. The west approach is 40 feet, and is also bad; but the proper officers assured me that it would soon be re- newed. Not done in July, 1882; 38 feet high. Half Howe Truss; two spans, each 60 feet. Nine panels; stone pier, but pile abutments. The chord is triple, 41, 9, 44 by 13 inches &apos; &quot;1256 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. TRAIN ACCIDENTS-ENTIRE LINE. ............... No. Date. Place. Character of train.

Salt creek. Salt creek. Roadways and gully. ? More and Forty-eight feet long, 15 feet high, over a small tributary of Salt creek; one, 48 feet long, and 10 feet high. East approach, one bay, 16 feet; then three trussed girders, having double 2-inch rods on each side; and double stringers, 8 by 15 inches. The rods deflect 5 feet below the bottom of the stringers. There is frame support on piles. Howe Truss, 14 panels, 10 9-10 feet each; 14 feet wide, 22 feet high. The rods are by threes, ranging from 1 to 2 inches. The main braces, from 7 by 11 to 9 by 12 inches; the counters, 7 by 8 or 7 by 10 inches. The lower chord has 4 pieces, 7 inches wide, and 15 inches deep; the upper is 13 inches deep. The floor-beams are 7 by 14 inches, and 5 to a panel. The west approach has 2 bays, each 16 feet, and one trussed girder, like other such named above. The piers are double-framed, and stand on piles; near by is riprap to protect the banks. Next comes a 64-foot trestle over a road, at a height of 10 feet, and another, 48 feet long, 10 feet high; one over a gully, 48 feet long. Then a trussed girder, of the same size as the preceding similar more trestles. structure, having the same length of stringers as an approach at the ends. One, 48 feet over a small gully; one, 80 feet over the bed of a stream, and is 14 feet high. Scioto river. Bridge over a slough. Canal bridge at Chilli- cothe. Remarks. Jamestown. Washington C. H. Chillicothe. Switches. East approach contains three bays, 16 feet each. The bridge has 3 spans, the east span has 13 panels, the middle, 15; the west one, 14 panels, each 10 9-10 feet long; width, 14 feet; height, 22 feet in the clear. The timbers are of the same size as those of a bridge of equal length of span over Salt creek above given. Then follow 31 bays of 16 feet each, on piles cross-braced; but the flooring-pieces are short, 4 by 8 inches, and there are ribbons. The east abutment, so to speak, is frame, but the west one shows first class masonry; 25 feet above water. Then follows another bridge of 14 panels of like construction. The east abutment is first-class masonry, the west one is a double frame bent; the banks are riprapped. There is a small, simple swing bridge over the canal, which needs no further mention here. The gradients from Dayton to Xenia are excellent; the track also is in good condition, except that the ditches in the cuts are scarcely large enough; they become easily choked. Below Jamestown the ditches need opening, and the ballast is light except the last 5 miles west of Washington C. H. Fences are few; in general the track may be said to be in fair condition. East of Washington C. H., all the way to Chillicothe, there is good ballast and plenty of it. The track is in first- rate condition; and about half the line is fenced. The right of way seems to be very narrow. East of Chillicothe the track continues the same all the way to Wells- ton except a couple of miles, except that the ballast between Wellston and Byers&apos; Station is cinder and slag. Along this part of the road there is very little fencing. All &amp;quot;stub&amp;quot; switches. &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 95 or two further west. Howe Truss, not very old; uncovered. It has 11 panels of 10 feet No. 28-a mile each; height and width same as usual; main braces vary from 6 by 9 to 8 by 10 inches; the counters are all 6 by 9 inches; lower chord has 4 pieces, 6 by 13 inches; the upper, 4 pieces, 6 by 13 inches; track stringers are 4 by 10 inches, and double, and notched on the road beams; lateral braces as usual; the floor is 8 by 10 inches, and at in- tervals of 10 inches. Five castings on the north chord and four on the south chord are crushed and useless. The bridge needs attention. This bridge is bad, and should be shortly replaced. The west ap- proach consists of four 32 foot trussed girders, double, 7 by 14 inches; creek. double rods, 2 inches; cross-braced skew frame of 12 inch oak, 12 feet high. Good abutments and pier. The west approach is 10 feet high, and the bents are 12 feet apart, and 8 panels. The track-stringers are oak, and double, except in two spaces (where they are 12 by 12 inches), and are 7 by 12 inches; the ribbons are 7 by 9 inches, and notched; 15 feet above water. The main bridge is of a peculiar structure, unlike anything else seen in the State. It has 10 panels, each 14 feet, is 134 feet in clear breadth, and 28 feet high. The road-beams are 6 by 14 inches, and 15 inches apart; the ribbons are 8 by 10 inches, and notched; the end struts and all the posts are Phoenix columns, varying from 6 to 9 inches in diameter. The upper and lower bracing, the vertical suspension members, and the sway-bracing cannot well be given in words. In place of more description, reference is made to page 28, book 2, accom- panying this report, for pencil sketches of the parts spoken of. The chord in the double end-panel consists of double g-inch channel-bars, 12 inches deep, with flanges 3 inches wide, the two being set at 13 inches clear interval. The next double pane! has the chord re-enforced by two g-inch bars, 3 inches deep; the next panel is also re-enforced by two bars 1 inches thick and 3 inches deep. I deem it one of the best bridges in the State. No. 27, North Fork of Paint Iron bridge, unusual pat- tern. No. 23, 1 mile east of Roxa- tle creek. It should have been stated that the vertical suspension-bars in the middle of the double panels are of inch iron, 24 inches wide. Howe Truss of 10 panels, each 11 feet, 14 feet wide, 19 high in the clear; good stone abutments. The bridge is covered. The main bell, over Lit- braces vary from 6 by 9 to 8 by 10 inches; the counters are all 6 by 9 inches. The vertical suspension-rods are in pairs, varying from 13 to 1 inches. At the two joints next to the abutment at each end, two additional suspension-rods have been added, 1 and 1 inch in diame- ter, respectively. Road-beams, 6 by 13 inches, 2 feet apart; the lower chord has four pieces, 6 by 13 inches; the upper chord is 11 inches- deep; the track stringers are 44 by 10 inches, double, and notched on the road-beams; the flooring is 3 by 8 inches, at intervals of 1 to 14 feet; the floor is consequently bad, and there are no guard-rails of any kind; the lateral bracing is of the usual form and strength.

The structure is all of wonderful uniformity and simplicity of design, the details being evidently de- signed with care, and executed in first-class workmanship. The uni- formity of design bespeaks economy of construction. The forms of members are those which are now of the most approved patterns among bridge engineers, and no effort appears to have been made here to originate some new patterns to evoke either praise or criticism. Next west is a three span bridge, over Scranton avenue. First is 195 Scranton ave- nue bridge. foot span, 25 feet depth; 13 panels of 15 feet each and 284 feet width c. to c. 26 feet high over street; double intersection and double track. This span is peculiar in having a pier built up for a support at the third panel point from the east end, the truss being continuous over it, and built with regard to it. Over this pier the column is composed of two channels 15 by 4-inch flange, and -inch web, with a three channel, same dimensions between, all connected by latticing. This column has a fixed bottom and pin top bearing. The first bay of lower chord at this column each side is a strut a 15-inch I-beam, §-inch web. Pin and square bearing.

All these trestles are built on the same plan, viz: These four piles, a cap, double horizontal cross braces, and also diagonal braces, well bolted to the piles. The stringers are double, 10 by 12 inches; corbels, 6 feet by 10 by 12 inches; ribbons, 4 by 6 inches, notched; floor 5 by 8 inches, and 12 inches apart; the piles are 16 feet apart.

Five spaces, 6 feet above the ground. The larger part of the ties are the same old short ones mentioned in last year&apos;s report. The right of way is not in good order. The steel rails from the vicinity of Jeffersonville northward, are well aligned, but are much out of surface, owing to the passage of heavy loads when the track was soft. In a few reaches of a mile or two each, the ballast is abundant and good. The road is perhaps half fenced, but it belongs chiefly to the farmers. 2.

Remark. State line Miami river bridge. 1867. Iron. Remark. The track also is in good condition, the ballast being good, and hi- ing enough. For a good part of the way it would be deemed inexpe- dient to fence the track, by reason of the situation of the road on the bank of the Ohio river. This is a bridge only partly in Ohio, and so much of it as is in the State is here described. Of the three spans, one and a half come in Ohio. The pattern of the bridge is that called &quot;Fink.&quot; The floor beams are I-beams, 15 inches deep, with the flange 5 inches wide, and the web is inch thick. On these are placed oak timber, 12 by 14 inches. The track-stringers are 8 by 16 inches, and double; there are also extra stringers at ends of the ties; stiffening irons are employed in the usual way. The top chord is a 14-inch cylinder; the columns are composed of 4 segments, 7 inches, joined as in the Phoenix column. In the measured truss are 16 panels, each 13 feet. The columns vary in size according to their position, the &quot;quarter column&quot; being 8 inches. The center pin is 4 inches, the quarter pin 3 inches, and the intermediate 24 inches. The half posts are quadruple, the quarters double; these have extra ribs for bracing purposes. The bars extending to the middle of the span are 8 in number on each side, 6 inches deep, and ruple, 5 inches deep by and are 3 by § inches. inch thick. The quarter bars are quad- inch thick.

Stringers are double, 7 by 15 inches; on the shorter span, 7 by 14 inches. There are corbels. Three 30 foot trussed girders, exactly like the preceding, and ordi- nary trestle, to make a total of 150 feet. Four 30 foot trussed girders, like the preceding, and 30 feet high; excellent flooring and good abutments. Exactly as the last, No. 3, except there are four trussed girders. These high trestles are all two-story, having four batter-posts at the ends. The stream of water over which they are placed is sluggish, and there is no danger to the abutments from floods. The rods of these girders dip five feet in passing from one end of the beam to the other, so that the girder is made very firm and secure. Like No. 4, except the abutments are much cracked. Same as No. 5, except the defects of the abutments. Then follows an arched tunnel, 400 feet long. Trestle over Hewitt&apos;s Fork, about 200 feet long, having two trussed girders near the center-low and strong, as is all the trestle on the main line. All the flooring and guards are of the very best, and need not be specifically mentioned with every structure. Trestle about 160 feet; usual length of bay, 15 feet. Three trussed girders, of the standard form on this road. Three trussed girders of 30 feet each, and 90 feet trestle additional. Two spans, each 37 feet; three 2-inch truss rods on each side. The abutments are heavy stone, badly bedded, and considerably broken. The middle of the stringers is supported by double frame bents resting on the rods. Two trussed girders, 30 feet; two 15 feet bays, similar to the others. One trussed girder, 30 feet; 3 bays, 15 feet each. One abutment is the natural rock; the other fair, but not first-rate. Tunnel, 350 feet long, with rock roof; sides earth. Three trussed 30 foot girders, and 5 bays, of 15 feet each; trestle work. These trestles are all but a few feet above the water, say from 10 to 15 feet. Same as No. 13; strong, all strong. Three 30 foot trussed girders; 3 spans ordinary trestle. A 70 foot trestle over the road, 5 or 6 miles west of Athens; will be rebuilt shortly. Two 30 foot trussed girders; 3 bays; ordinary. Two 25 foot trussed girders. A short good trestle. Two spans, Howe Truss; 10 panels, 10 feet each. The counters are all 6 by 9; the main braces vary from 7 by 9 inches to 8 by 9 inches. The rods are in pairs, and vary from 1 to 1 inches; at the end there are two extra 1-inch rods. The ribbons on this road are very large. Width, clear, 14 feet; height, 20. Built in 1865, but well preserved, and will require renewal within two or three years. The abutments and pier are good. &quot; &quot;568 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

Painting. logs be cut through the center, so as to lay open the heart wood, that &quot;sour rot,&quot; as it is termed here, may be avoided at the heart wood. Structures all appear to be closely watched for defects, and new material substituted or added as decay or weakness appears. The in- spection develops no oversight or defects, and the road is regarded as safe. Useful precautions, aiming at economy, are observed throughout all divisions. For instance, iron bridges are painted, and the parts so formed as to admit of painting, to prevent deterioration by rusting. Wooden bridges, as a general rule, are promptly covered for preserva- tion. The setting of clamps and keys of wooden bridge chords in lead paint, is a practice of slight cost, but tending greatly to durability of the close joints thus leaded. &apos; &quot;1094 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROALS.

LOUIS AND PACIFIC RAILWAY,&apos; from Toledo westward via Defiance to State Line. Inspection made September 2, 1882. Structures are numbered from Toledo westward. Gauge of track, 4 feet 8 inches. No. 5, an iron plate girder with good stone abutments. Made for a double track. No. 6, a through combination Post truss, over the Wabash and Erie canal, 3 miles west of Toledo. Rail to water, 15 feet. Span, 153 feet; width, 14 feet in clear. Main truss tie from top of vertical end post to end of the first panel, or half panel in lower chord, two, by 3. From top of same end post to end of the 14-panel distance, two, 1 by 4 inches; next tie, two, 1 by 3 inches; next tie, two, 1 by 3 inches; next tie, two, by 24 inches; counter tie in the end fractional panel, one, 1 rod; next panel, two, 14 rod; end post wood, about two, 10 by 16 inches; first inside post, wood, two, about 10 inches square. The timbers recently bored by the chief engineer, and found sound. The bridge according to a statement made last year was discredited by the railway company, and to be replaced by a new one, &amp;quot;which is already ordered, and will be up before snow falls,&amp;quot; but the fact that a new flooring and deck has been put on to the old truss, indicates that the trusses are regarded now by the company as suitable for continued service. The bridge appears trust- worthy. Built by McNara &amp;amp; Clafton in 1873 or 1874. The age suggests careful watching of the timbers for weakness from incipient decay. The approaches are banks. Masonry, good stone, in cement, on pile foundations. Wall plates are castings. Top chord 6, 8, 6 by 12 inches. Floor beams, two, 12 inch I-beams, 7-16 inch webs. Stringers, three, 7 by 14 inch wood under rails and on corbels. End bearers, 1 Summary of Finances and Business. Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway: Miles owned.............

HATHAWAY, Speaker pro tem. of the House of Representatives. R. A. HORR, President pro tem, of the Senate. Passed April 6, 1883. [Page 99, Statutes of Ohio, 1883.] AN ACT To provide for the improvement and development of railroads owned in common by two or more railroad companies within this state. SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio, That in case two or more railroad companies, being the owners in common of the whole or any part of a railroad situated within this state, and by reason of inequality in the amount of business done thereon by each company, require a different degree and extent of improvement and development of the same, it shall be lawful for such com- panies to enter into an arrangement that may be agreed upon between them for enlarging, improving, developing or increasing the facilities of such railroad or any &apos; &apos;486 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. the locks on the switch itself, and that the devices by which this switch is relocked shall, when completely relocked, unlock the two signals. The signals are then to be cleared for the coming train, the operations for which are automatically to lock the switch locks beyond the control of the operator until the last car of the train has passed the switch, and until the cleared signals are restored to signify danger. Fourth-That each signal may be set to danger as soon as the locomotive passes it, and that the switch be restored to derailment as soon as the last car passes, but not until the signals are restored to danger, thus restoring all to the normal condition. Fifth-Where trains run both ways on a given track at a crossing, it is to be under- stood that the switch and two signals as above are to be placed in that track on both sides of the crossing; and that in such case the two switches are to be operated in conjunction as one; that is, both together are to be unlocked or relocked, and as above, both together are to remain automatically locked out of control of the opera- tor till the last car of a train passes the last switch or point of danger. Also, that the signals on that side of the crossing opposite the approaching train remain securely locked throughout all the operations pending the passing train. Sixth-At such a location as a single or double track crossing, or the crossing of yard tracks by a single or double track where trains are to pass without stopping, it is to be understood that each of the several intersecting tracks shall be provided with switches and signals as above, and that all the switches and signals at such location shall be so interlocked that in the operations attending the passage of a train or engine over one of the tracks, the unlocking of the switches in that track shall, before completely unlocked, absolutely lock, to the &quot;normal condition,&quot; the devices operating the switches and signals in all tracks intersecting that track. Seventh-Where several parallel or non-intersecting tracks are crossed by other tracks, it is to be understood that two or more of the parallel tracks may each simul- taneously pass a train under the same rules as for any one of those tracks separately. Eighth-Any turnout from a track between a switch and crossing, on which a train may reach a crossing, is to be treated as a crossing track. Ninth That all the devices and appliances at a crossing as above be protected so that no meddler can interfere with the correct working of the apparatus by the oper- ator. Tenth-It is also recommended that any turnout between a near and distant signal be provided with a switch and signal, to be operated by interlock, with the crossing appliance in such a way that the signal must be locked to danger and the switch locked to the main line by the operation of unlocking the main line switches. And, it is also recommended that an electric enunciator be arranged in connection with each track, so that the approach of a train will be signaled to the operator from a point at a considerable distance beyond the distant signal. These requirements are provisional, and are subject to modifications to secure other equally safe means that will attain the same end. &apos; &quot;OHIO CENTRAL RAILROAD.

The web plates are stiffened against buckling by vertical stays, riveted on from top to bottom. These are made of angle bars, and are nearest together at the ends of the girder. Angle bar web stays, 3 by 3 by inches. First stay from end of girder, 20 feet; this to the next, 4 feet; in all, 9 stays. The floor-beams rest on the lower chord flange inside, and are secured by rivets. The stringers are in the same plan as the floor-beams, but of less depth, and connected by strips of angle bar or bent plate, riv- eted to stringers and floor-beams. The stringers are in pieces, going from one floor-beam to the next.

BOYLE, Notary Public. &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 258 this State within the past year, indicates that complete mutual adap- tation of permanent way and rolling stock can only be a question of a reasonable amount of time. At new Carlisle is found a model station building for a small town. Water tanks on the new road hold 54,000 gallons. One man pumps by steam pumps for three tanks, one going from one to another by boarding trains as often as necessary. Along by Carey and Tiffin is found a variety of rails-iron rails with the Trimble joints; then some chain iron; then some 56-pound steel rail for about five miles from Tiffin. Some of the rails along here are in 20 feet lengths, with chain fastenings. From Kenton 100,000 bushels of wheat is annually shipped. Just north of Belle Center some 60-pound steel rail, with angle bar joints is observed; but before No. 141 is reached, the rails change back to iron and Trimble joints. Bellefontaine is a shipping point for lumber and flour. The side tracks here are rather poor. Steel rail extends from Springfield nearly to the crossing with the C., C., C. &amp;amp; I. R. R. here. Embankments in the Ohio Division, ordinary. Some places narrow. Ditches indefinite much of the way, and not well cleared. No definite cross-section of road-bed appears to be adopted. The road is generally well fenced, with boards and rails. Ballast of gravel of ordinary to a somewhat inferior quality. Ties of white or black oak, average dimensions, 6 by 8 inch face, by 8 feet long. Average duration, about 8 years. Number per mile, about 2,800 to 3,000. Number laid during the year, not stated, but the road indicates it to be large. Average present cost, 35 to 40 cents. General present condition of ties, safe, though about one in five new ties needed to put the road into unquestionably good condition. Rails, 56 pounds per yard for the old iron, and even the steel rail to within the past year. Steel rail, 56 and 60 pounds per yard. No new iron laid since last year. The number of steel rails laid during the past year, not stated, but known to be a quite considerable quantity. The joints are by angle bar, and fish plate for steel. Fish plate Trim- ble, and chair for iron; no trouble from creeping of rails. Switches are the stub, on iron track, and split for 60 pound steel rails by Elliott, of St. Louis. Signals are by bell, whistle, flags, lamps, and torpedoes. Red is the danger signal for either flag or lamp, and white is safety. Trains are run by schedule and train dispatcher. Station buildings in ordinary condition. Sidings in fair condition as to rails, but too short for the present heavy engines recently adopted, and being run over all the road. The Spear&apos;s heater is used on passenger cars. The platform and coupler is the Miller&apos;s. Wrecking tools are kept at Springfield. &quot; &quot;LAKE SHORE AND MICHIGAN SOUTHERN RAILWAY. 1155 Freight-Average amount per mile received for each ton........

GENERAL REMARKS UPON THE PENNSYLVANIA COMPANY&apos;S RAILROADS IN OHIO. Through Howe, mile post 12 + 2,009 feet. The character and costliness of the bridge structures on these lines Characters of vary considerably. The P., Ft. W. &amp;amp; C. line has a great number of bridges. iron bridges, and wooden bridges of any magnitude are the exception. A great number of them are 60 feet or less in length, and are usually iron plate girders. There are also a large number of iron truss bridges. It can almost be said of this road, for that part in Ohio at least, that its bridge structures are in stone and iron. A wooden trestle is nearly unknown here. The unusual occurrence of the replacing of iron bridges by iron was this year found to be the fact on the Eastern Di- vision. This is due, however, not from a decay or deterioration of the iron bridges, but from the fact that heavier engines are now going into freight service on the Eastern Division, viz.: the same as Class I and Class E of the Pennsylvania Railroad, the total weights of which in working order is 73 and 62½ tons, and wheel base 47 and 45} feet, re- spectively. The new iron bridges are made much stronger than the old. The C. &amp;amp; P. line, direct from Cleveland to Bellaire, has a more nearly equal division into iron and wooden bridges, though it is rapidly changing to iron and stone, while the N. W. O. line has no iron bridges, except the large ones over the Maumee river. Other lines and branches have no iron bridges, with the exception of the one plate girder at Youngstown. The longest on the lines in the State being 74 feet. This distribution of iron structures appears to be nearly in propor- tion to the passenger transportation, which, conceding to iron the greater safety, will be accepted as the most judicious arrangement for a given expenditure on all the company&apos;s lines. Distribution of iron strue- tures in pro- portion to passenger transporta- tion. ents. All the superintendents and engineers met in the tour of inspection Superintend- over these lines, appear deeply in earnest in their efforts to secure the highest possible degree of excellence and safety for their respective &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 359 &amp;amp; Maurice, in 1881; 15 feet in width.

Gusset or angle plate at ends to top flange of girders for sway staying; this plate 19 inches at beam. Four floor-beams to bridge, and 5 panels of the lateral system, with floor-beam struts, and 13-inch tie rods. Across end of bridge a channel bar, 6 by 2 inches, by 1-inch thick.

Five bays of top chord, and six of lower; and said to have 12 panels. Middle points of trusses in sec- tion have vertical web, by 12 inches; 4 angle bars, about 3 by 4, by inches thick, and two plates at top flange, 12 by, and 12 by inches. Lower chord at middle a vertical web, by 12 inches, and two angle bars, about 3 by 4, by inches, and flange plates, 12 by 14 inches at bottom. No flange at top edge, nor angle bars. Whole of chords same construction, but lighter near ends. End posts inclined, same as main web members, about 45°, and made like top chord, of 1 web, 12 by inches, four angles, 3 by 4, by inches, and a plate outside, 12 by § inches. First main tie, from top of the end post, inclined at about 45°, a plate of by 20 inches. Next web member of truss, a strut, inclined also at about 45°, but in opposite direction, 8 by 10 inches, outside; made of two channels, 10 by 3, by inches, a plate, 8 by -inches, and slats opposite. The next member is inclined at about 45°, but opposite to the last, and made of a web plate, by 14 inches, with 2 by 5-16 inch angle bars riveted on one edge. The angle bars are to stiffen the mem- ber to make it serve as a counter brace as well as tie. This construc- tion makes the whole truss a sort of trellis or Warren&apos;s truss, in out- line with triangular panels. The lower triangular panels have vertical ties for carrying floor-beams at the middle of bottom chord bays. These vertical ties are 24 inches wide at base where joining floor-beams, and serve as sway stays to top chord. These verticals are made of 24 by i inch webs; two angles, 14 inches, at one edge, and four, 3 by 3, by -inch angles at the other edge of web; the latter four forming on edge of plate a sort of an open column, with thimbles filling pieces. The same is at each mid-panel floor-beam. Floor-beams are also at the panel points, there being 12 in the bridge. The bridge is, however, askew, making 12 instead of 11 floor-beams necessary. Floor-beams are 30 inches deep; plate, 5-16 inches thick; flanges, 4 angles, 5 by 5, No. 41, Kill- buck. No. 42, War- ren truss. &quot; &apos;820 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

Pile bridges. gravel heaves the rails into irregular lines, which &quot;ride&quot; harder than the unaltered lines of rail on stone ballast. The standard rail section from 1874 to 1879 was 4 inches deep, 2 9-32 inches across the middle of the head, 4 inches across the foot, and 15-32 inch thick in the stem. Weight per yard, 52 pounds. From 1879 to the present the standard has been a 59-pound rail, 4 5-16 inches ex- treme depth, 2 7-32 inches thick through the middle of head, 7-16 inch thick in stem, and 3 inches wide in foot. Edges of foot inch thick. At the web the foot is inch thick. Sides of stem concave to a radius of 12 inches. Crown of rail convex to a 10-inch radius. Top side corners of head rounded to a radius of inch. Lower corners of head rounded to a radius of 11-32 inch. The head and foot join the stem by fillets of inch radius. Under side of head, except the round and fillet, flat and inclined about the same as the top of the foot. One feature of this rail, wherein it differs from the most usual modern practice, consists in nearly vertical or parallel sides of head. The same fish-plate fits this rail and the standard of 1874 to 1879. All of the main The 52-pound rail is now found only in sidings. track rail in Ohio-73 miles-is of the 59-pound steel. Practically, no steel rail has been laid in the State the past year because the track is already steel, in good condition. The length of ties was formerly 8 feet, but they are now 9 feet. Width of face, 6 to 94 inches, laid 3,000 to the mile, oak and elm, latter being chemically treated. Chemically treated elm costs about same as oak, viz. 35 cents. New ties of past year oak. Average duration on sand and gravel, 6 to 8 years; on stone ballast, 10 years. Total num- ber laid since last year, 25,000. The cattle guards consist of 3 or more long ties laid crosswise the track in the bottom of a pit about 2 feet deep by 7 feet lengthwise. On these is laid a frame consisting of 4 pieces, 12 by 12 inches length- wise, 2 being under the rails, and 2 about 12 feet apart, all about 7 feet length, across the ends of which are spiked thick planks. On this frame the ties, 6 by 8 inches flat by 14 feet long, sawed and with bev- eled edges, are laid, 5 or 6 in all. Outside the rails are 4 wheel guards, two on each side, bolted to ties. At each side of the guard is a re- clining fence, length parallel to track, from which runs the division fence. The standard pile bridge for the numerous nearly dry openings con- sists of 5 piles with 12 by 12 or 12 by 14 inches by 20 feet caps, and 3 by 12 inch bracing; with 10 to 14 feet spans, etc. The distance from the outside pile to the next is 5 feet; to the next, 3 feet 9 inches, the middle one. The deck consists of a 6 by 16 inch stick on and along near ends of cap; then inside of that just under ends of the ties (the bearer), one, 6 by 16 inches; then under the rails, two, 7 by 16 inches. The ties are 6 by 8 inches, placed 16 inches c. to c., and 14 feet long.

No. 26 is a two span iron plate girder, just beyond and forming the northern approach to No. 27. Each span is 42 feet long. From this point of the road to Hudson, with the exception of the long trestle near Marshallville, the structures are all low short bridges. Those of last year were low Howe truss bridges, all weakened by de- cay, and supported by one or more intermediate bents between the abutments. A few of these still remain. The following have been taken out and their places supplied by new structures: No. 19, over Salt creek, by an open iron girder bridge, 73 feet long. No. 16, over Salt creek, by an iron plate girder, 44 feet long. No. 9, over Chippewa creek, by an iron plate girder, 51 feet long. No. 6, over the canal near Akron, by an iron plate girder, 54 feet long. In addition to the above bridges numbered, No. 11, a low Howe truss; No. 7, a two-span low Howe truss, each span 50 feet long; No. 4, a three-bent trestle; No. 3, a low Howe truss; are shortly to be re- placed by new plate girder bridges, which are now being manufactured. They will probably be all in place before this report reaches you, and then the work of renewing all the bridges which were becoming weak from age and decay on the entire line of this road will have been ac- complished.

On this division all bridge abutments are of stone, which have been found so uniformly excellent in condition, that notes have not been entered concerning them in the above, except occasionally. No. 9 is the only one found without cut stone abutments. Wall plates are in exceptionally fine condition. In the few instances that ants were found at work in the wall plate blocks, common salt was found sprinkled about for driving them off. On all divisions of this road the abutments have been found excep- tionally good, uniformly in sand stone, with tooled joints, rock face, and in cement, and in thick courses. These abutments have been found in excellent condition, with only two or three exceptions. Rail eleva- tion. Abutments. Ants. The stone work of this division is mostly of what the road-master Selecting terms Ohio sandstone. The road-master states that this stone is apt quarries. to be soft, and too easily disintegrated for good work. Hence, care is needed in selecting quarries, to insure a good, durable quality of stone. This stone is rejected for ballast. Cast iron. All iron bridges on the B. and O. R. R. are framed with pin bearings, Pins. the pins being steel. Cast iron is found in no important parts of the iron bridges for a main reliance, except in the upper chords, end posts and columns of Bollman trusses. All iron bridges are well painted. The wooden bridges are apparently very carefully looked after, no defects having been found. It was gratifying to find every weakness which appeared possible to develop in a bridge provided for even in advance. Thus independent arches are frequently found added for strengthening a light bridge too good to be soon removed. The poorer wooden bridges have promptly been provided with trestle bents, one or more placed under at the thirds or quarters, to give ample security till such bridges could be replaced by iron ones, the latter being appar- ently eagerly sought after by the road-master. Bridge doc- tors. At one point east of Newark, between No. 26 and Barnesville, a high slip sides. embankment gave trouble, in spreading out at the base, caused by springs of water underneath, and a too great weight of embankment. The difficulty was cured by making the upper 10 or 12 feet of the fill, at the failing point, of coal slack from a mine near by. The dimin- ished weight, due to the lesser specific gravity, was a sufficient relief for the unstable bed. Considerable stone ballast is being introduced on this road, it being found on all divisions. The longest stretch is that from Cambridge to Bellaire, a distance of fifty miles, where it is almost entirely of stone. (Ohio sandstone.) In the hilly country of south-eastern Ohio this road has numerous deep cuts, many of them liable to drop stones and masses of dirt. Men are stationed in these cuts on watch, day and night, provided Dangerous cuts. &quot; &quot;806 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. FENCING.

Then nex come 34 bays of trestle work, from 18 to 26 feet high, and 12 feet in length each. Each bent has two transverse and two longitudinal braces, besides two lateral stays set in diagonally. Next is one Boll- man Truss of like dimensions with the preceding Bollman. The track from Hamden to Parkersburg is well ballasted. Chiefly with stone. The alignment of the rails is good, but the surfacing is only moderately done. The road is mostly fenced, except at inter- vals among the hills where fencing would be superfluous. At the time of the inspection, August 28, 1882, the ditches were not in good condi- tion, owing to the excessive rains of the summer, and the hilliness of the country through which the road passes. The rails are steel except a stretch of 7 miles. There are from 2,800 to 2,900 ties per mile, mostly in good condition, but it will be good policy to replace parts of the line with new ties. The rails are connected by the usual angle bar; the switches are the ordinary stub switch. The Station Houses generally small and neat. 2. Short branch to Marietta. The road bed is good and in fair condition, and the track is fenced.

Flooring as the preceding, and is racked greatly for want of support by the missing guard rails. A frame trestle, 22 feet high, having 22 bays of 12 feet each; total, 275 feet. In all respects like No. 1, except it is a little older. Trestle, frame, 250 feet total length; 31 feet high at the highest point. In all respects like No. 1. It is 7 or 8 years old. Some timbers have been replaced, and the bridge has been repaired. Eleven bays or spaces between bents, all 12 feet, which is uniform on this branch. Total length, 137 feet; highest point, 20 feet. Some of the timbers show marks of decay. There are good guard rails. Nineteen bays, 237 feet; 19 feet high; very similar to the others. Frame trestle, 48 feet high and 350 feet long. The middle third is cross-braced, and the highest part has been rebuilt this year. It has two 2 story frame bents, and heavy long timbers and sloping braces. Fourteen bents; length, 175 feet, total; is 8 or 10 feet high; is newer and better than the others. It is large stone culvert, and is as substantial as can be. Short span of 25 feet over road; sufficiently secure. Muskingum river bridge, at Marietta. Three spans, Howe Truss, and two approaches. The west approach has 2 twenty foot spans over a roadway, and also 3 ten-foot spans about 8 feet high. Iron, Keystone; 137 feet long, 21 feet high, and 21 feet broad from center to center. The posts are made of 4 angle or channel bars, 3 by 3 inches, and inch thick, separated at 2 inches interval, and smaller at the end. The end strut is composed of 2 channel bars of 4-inch iron, 8 by 2 inches flange, and plate of 1-inch iron 14 inches broad. &quot; &quot;CINCINNATI SOUTHERN RAILWAY. 877 Limestone-Carried ten miles or more........

The complete section areas for whole bridge, due to such parts, are to be doubled as obtained from the single truss figures given. On the B. and O. R. R. many things are adopted as standard, and practice made to conform with the standards as nearly as consistent with local demands. For instance, the standard wall plate for a bridge is composed of two oak sticks 12 by 12 inches square, and changed every four or five years. This short life is required of these blocks because of their importance, the frequent replacing of them having the object of avoiding rotting and crushing, and canting of the bridge. The ends of these wall plate blocks are beveled at an angle of 30 to 40 degrees from near the bearing of bridge, so that water will run away. Remarks.

This line is singularly free from bridges, running, as it does, from the mouth toward the head of the water-courses. Only two structures were of a magnitude calling for report. Of these, one is a piece of trestle work at Baltimore, 56 feet long, having a bad pier in the middle of the main structure, and supports under each half; the timbers themselves are of sufficient size; the track-stringers being double, and 8 by 18 inches; the ties 8 by 6 inches, and placed 8 inches apart; the ribbon pieces, 6 by 6 inches, and bolted at intervals of 8 feet.

It is not considered necessary to give the details of the structure in this part of the report, since a special report was made about it in connection with the deep- ening of the stream over which it is constructed. marks. The general condition of this connecting link is like that of most General re- connecting roads or cut-offs. It is kept in passable condition, but no money is wasted on repairs, and not much is spent for ornamental purposes. And inasmuch as the structures are very few, there is a measure of safety, both for passengers and for freight, equal to that of other roads in better condition. Respectfully submitted, R. W.

Fillets at junction of stem, with head of foot about to a-inch radius. Foot flanges at edge inch thick. This company has mills and factories of its own, and makes most of the cars and locomotives, including all fittings, trimmings, etc., rolled iron for iron culverts and other and larger structures; in fact everything but rails; but it has not capacity to supply all of its iron bridges. Iron bridges must comply with the following points, viz.: Have 14 feet clear width for straight lines, with proper increase for curves; 18 feet clear over rails, no cast iron, except wall plates and skewbacks for end posts. No hollow columns nor beams, and all posts accessible by the paint brush. Maximum strain for any member, 10,000 pounds per square inch; as due to passage of a train of consolidated engines of 50 tons each. Adopted type, the Pratt truss. The weight of heaviest passenger locomotives on this road, on track ready for service, 125,000 pounds. Heaviest freight engine, likewise conditioned, 117,000 pounds. Weight of sleeping coach, 58,000 pounds. Weight of a six-wheeled truck passenger coach, 38,000 pounds. Weight of loaded freight car, 60,000 pounds. A general rule for the elevation of the outer rail on this road is stated to be 1 inch per degree up to 3 degrees; inch for each additional degree from 3 to 5 degrees, and inch for each additional degree from 5 to 7 degrees. The standard switch of this road is the Lorenz&apos;s safety switch, though the safety spring (unsafety spring as called here) is left off. Its use is very general, especially where trains run at speed. The cross-rods connecting the switch rails are here bent downward, so as to lie in a plane below the level of the top surface of the ties. The object of this is to put those rods out of danger of being caught or struck by dangling brake-beams, or other parts of trains accidentally out of place. These rods are five in number, and placed about 2 feet apart. These switches are thoroughly made, and accompanied by a heavy cast-iron switch stand. The latter has a base plate 15 by 18 inches, from which rises a single trunk in T section, 4 by 5 inches, of 1 inch thickness of flange and web. The height is 32 inches, at the top it branches to form a guide arc slot for the lever to work in. The ends of the arc have notches for receiving a catch on the lever for holding. This catch is held in place by a padlock. The lever is pivoted to the trunk at a point one foot above bottom of base. The switch signal is a revolving one, car- ried on a vertical rod. The lower end of the latter rests in a socket in the base, and thence it passes up through an eye in a projection from the top of the standard, the same reaching out in the opposite direction from the lever arc. This stand is the essence of simplicity, all the parts being the standard, with its lever arc and signal supports in one casting; the wrought-iron lever, the lever fulcrum pin, the catch, and the signal shaft. The whole is an admirable design, and evinces Mills and factories. Iron bridge specifica- tons. Weights of lo- comotives. Elevation of outer rail.

Sidings. Ballast. Cattle guards. Lightning protectors. Embank- ments and right of way. Ties. These lengths are from buffer to buffer. An engine, 51 feet, drivers 60 inches in diameter. The standard steam pressure carried on locomo- tives is 130 pounds per square inch. On this road water-buckets are carried under the car seats, two cases to a car, each holding 3 or 4 buckets. The sidings of the E. &amp;amp; W. Divisions of the P. Ft. W. &amp;amp; C. R&apos;y are very long, often two miles, this length being necessary to facilitate the handling of trains. They are, probably, in a measure prospective of a double track. A large proportion of the track of these divisions is ballasted with stone. A stretch of about 70 miles between Crestline and Lima is re- markable for its uniformly good qualities. The cattle guards of this road are simple, efficient, and durable. One feature worthy of note is the bedding of the pit with about a foot depth of stone. The pit is drained when possible. See Fig. 3, of last year&apos;s report, page 403. Lightning protectors are placed on 2 or 3 poles in towns near offices. Particulars respecting the Eastern Division. The embankments and right of way are in good condition, and kept neat; also yards. Right of way mostly 66 feet, though some is 100 feet. The ditches are 18 inches to 2 feet deep, with a flat bottom and fair slope of sides. From the rail to the edge of ditch the distance is 67 inches for stone ballasted track. The bed is stated to be prepared in a peculiar way here for ballast, by the raising of the bed in the middle part, and allowing the stone to extend down the sloping edges to meet the flat part at edge of ditch. All ballast of this division is limestone and slag, except about 47 miles of gravel. The fencing is mostly board, though barbed wire is used in the present standard, which consists of three wires and a board, the lower wire being 7 inches from the ground, the second wire 8 inches higher, the third wire 10 inches still higher, and the 6-inch board being at its lower edge 12 inches above the third wire. The ties are oak, costing 58 to 60 cents each. Number laid since last year, 80,000 to 90,000. Laid 16 to a 30-foot rail, or 2,816 per mile. Size, 7 inches thick by 8 to 12 inches wide, by 8 feet long. They last six to seven years for heavy traffic. No iron rail is in use except in siding. Since last year 14 miles of steel rail has been laid. Joints are secured by angle bar; suspension. No serious trouble by creeping. At Wooster east for five miles, automatic electric blocks are in use on a heavy grade. The signal posts are placed mile apart on one side, and mile on the other side of the track. The engineer watches his own side. There are twelve or fourteen signal posts, with revolv- ing signal vanes, worked by electric currents sent through the rails and ear axles. On this hill the grade is being changed and reduced to 0.91 foot per 100 feet. The compensation for curvature is 2.34 feet per &quot; &apos;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 205 and 7 by 16 inches.

CINCINNATI AND WESTWOOD RAILROAD-NARROW GAUGE.¹ Trestle of 16 bays, 20 feet each; total, 320 feet; 35 feet at the highest point. Corbels, 10 by 12 inches, and 10 feet long are used. Posts are 10 by 10 inches; longitudinal inclined braces, by 8 inches in part, and 8 by 8 inches in part; stringers, 6 by 13 inches double; flooring, 5 by 6 inches, at 1 foot intervals; ribbons, 5 by 6 inches, bolted at in- tervals of 10 feet, but not notched; and would offer no valuable aid in case of derailment. Similar to No. 1, but is not quite so high; being 30 feet at the highest point, and having 27 bays of 20 feet each, or 540 feet in all. Ten panels of 12 feet, 16 feet high; like the preceding in size of tim- ber. The guard rails are not bolted, and are useless. Roadway; two stringers on each side, 7 by 14 inches; and under- neath these is a strain beam, 15 by 6 inches. Fourteen 20-foot spaces; at the highest point, 40 feet; whole length, 280 feet; guard rails are better than those on the other trestles. There is longitudinal double bracing in connection with the strain beams, for one-third the entire distance. Nine spaces, 20 feet each, or 120 feet in all; 30 feet at the highest point, and entirely similar to the preceding. Twenty-four 20-foot spaces, about 20 feet high on an average. The ties are long, the track being on a short curve. This trestle is in pro- cess of being filled. The grade in places is very steep; the track quite rough, and still out of shape, both in alignment and surfacing. There is about half enough ballast, and the fencing seems to belong to the owners of the land or lots. But the road has been very greatly improved in all the appointments since my report of last year, and is about as well made as one could look for in any such short line, used merely as a con- venience for a few miles travel.

Findlay. Bluffton. Buckland Howe truss. St. Mary&apos;s Howe truss. Howe truss, near St. Mary&apos;s, canal feeder. A careful inspection of this bridge and ten trestle spans connected with it, shows it to be in excellent condition, and wearing well. At Findlay there is a 150-foot span Howe truss bridge, containing 12 panels, each 12 feet long and 22 feet deep, and resting on stone mas- onry abutments, 20 feet high, which is, throughout, almost identical, in style of construction and arrangemeut of parts, with that at Fre- mont, the only points of difference noted being that its lower chord is 6, 7, 7, 6 by 14 inches in section, and end main braces, 11 by 12 inches, and center tie rods, two in number, each 14 inches in diameter; end rods, three each, 24 inches diameter. In other respects, the two bridges are exactly alike. The bridge at Bluffton, on the old portion of the road, has been abandoned as a bridge, and will, no doubt, be entirely replaced soon by a new structure. The main weight is borne by auxiliary supports, which reduce the original length to spans less than 30 feet in length. The chords and web members of the original bridge are much de- cayed, but the temporary supports, with new track stringers and end bearers, give it the requisite strength for the service required of it. The part of the bridge above the lower chords, excepting track stringers, is not of much service, and so far as giving strength and security to the structure, could be entirely dispensed with. At Buckland there is a Howe truss bridge, 130 feet long, having 10 panels. Height of truss, 21 feet. Lower chords, 6, 6, 6, 6 by 14 inches. Main braces, center, double, 9 by 9 inches; ends, 10 by 12 inches; counters, 6 by 3 inches to 8 by 8 inches; tie rods, two each, 1½ inches diameter, to three, 2 inches diameter. Floor beams, ties, and stringers, as in bridge at Fremont. It has no guard rails. At St. Mary&apos;s there are two Howe truss bridges, one over the canal, 80 feet long, and one deck bridge, containing two spans, 33 and 100 feet long, respectively, over the St. Mary&apos;s river. These having already been referred to in detail in a previous special report, a further de- scription is not considered necessary here. A description of members would be useless, for the timbers are badly decayed, and have lost a large proportion of their original bearing capacity. The bridge over the St. Mary&apos;s river depends upon its temporary trestle supports. That over the canal is in very bad condition, and unless attended to soon, will certainly go down. On the Munster branch of this road, from St. Mary&apos;s to Munster, there is but one Howe truss bridge, over the canal feeder, near St. Mary&apos;s. It is 99 feet long, and contains 10 panels. Height of truss, 21 feet. Lower chord, 6, 6, 6, 6 by 14 inches. Main braces, from 7 by 9 inches to 9 by 10 inches. Floor beams, suspended, 6 by 14 inches, four per panel. Stringers, double, 5 by 12 inches. Ties, 6 by 6 inches, and 8 inches apart. The ligher dimensions of parts on this bridge are due to the fact that it is on a short local branch road, which is sub- jected only to a very light traffic as compared to that of the main line. &quot; &quot;910 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

WHEELING AND LAKE ERIE RAILROAD.¹ From Toledo, Ohio, to Valley Junction, a station in Tuscarawas county. It runs via Fremont, Norwalk, Massillon. Here is also a branch road twelve miles long, from Norwalk to Huron harbor, on Lake Erie. The road was opened to traffic early in September from Toledo to its present terminus. Some grading has been done beyond Valley Junc- tion to the vicinity of Bowerston. The ultimate destination of the line is Wheeling, West Virginia. The construction of this line was com- menced about two years ago at Creston, a station on the N. Y., P. &amp;amp; O. R. R. by taking up in part various abandoned old enterprises, parts of lines projected, and in some instances graded, and adding to these new franchises. The management of the Cleveland and Marietta road is now merged in this, and trains are run through from Toledo to Ma- rietta, the gap of seven miles between Valley Junction and Canal Dover being at present closed by a lease of right of way over the track of the Minerva branch of the C. &amp;amp; P. R. R. The schedule time of through trains from Toledo to Marietta is at present a little more than twelve hours for a distance of 260 miles. The Wheeling and Lake Erie is a well built road, and although it will not probably take a commanding place as an enterprise until the design of its projectors-its extension to Wheeling is accomplished, it has already, throughout its whole length, awakened many local industries, from which it is now deriving revenue in a small way. First among these are lumber industries, from Toledo to Oak Harbor, where, for a distance of twenty-four miles, the road runs through an almost continuous forest, and at intervals of from four to five miles between these points, saw-mills, lime-kilns, and such like enterprises have been established, and the forests of this part of the old black swamp are rapidly disappearing and giving way to farm houses and corn and wheat fields. At Norwalk, 63 miles from Toledo, a branch road reaches the harbor of Port Huron, over the line of a former narrow gauge road. The line is winding, following the course of the right bank of the Huron river to an extensive system of docks in the harbor on the lake. At this place a dock, 900 feet long and 100 feet wide, has already been 1 Summary of Finances and Business. Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad: Miles owned, constructed.

The improvements, made since the inspection of last year, consist in the completion of the road from Bedford to Cleveland, twelve miles, and Dell Roy to Sherrodsville, seven miles; also, construction of sev- eral side tracks and coal branches, and thirteen miles new road on the Coshocton branch, and new station buildings at Cleveland, Newburg, Twinsburg, Mogadore, Kent; Hartville, Middlebranch, Osnaburg, Rob- ertsville, Dell Roy, and Sherrodsville; also, filling a 230-foot trestle near Robertsville, and replacing it with a 75-foot Howe truss bridge, and taking out three short wooden bridges between Canton and Carrollton, and substituting therefor iron plate girders. All supports for bridges, as abutments and piers, on this road are of first-class stone masonry, and in all openings for single span beams or girders, however short-even for cattle passes-the abutments on which stringers rest are also heavy stone masonry, with perhaps two or three exceptions. The system of cattle guards first introduced on this road does not seem to work well. They are now being changed for those of the ordinary pattern: The bridges are all very strongly built, and, in most cases, fully able to bear the ordinary standard gauge locomotives and cars, although now subjected to a traffic more than one-third lighter than this.

Another Howe truss bridge about one mile north of above and south of Dell Roy, is an exact counterpart of it, on stone masonry abut- ments. Between Carrollton and Oneida are two 8-panel Howe truss bridges, on stone masonry abutments, similar in style of construction to the above, with slight modification in size of parts due to difference in length. Between the above and Oneida there are two iron 42-foot span plate girders and two straining beams or wooden girders, over small water ways, which have been put in place of pile trestles which were first built. The plate girders are 42 feet span, 42 inches deep, §-inch web, &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 457 5 by 10 inches; upper, same width, 9 inches deep.

The bridge timbers, notwithstanding their great age, appeared sound to a careful examination, which must be largely due to the protection afforded by the roof and side sheeting which shelter them. Just before this there is an iron plate girder bridge, over a street, and a similar one over the same street on the Columbus division. The gir- der is 50 feet long, and the web plate 72 inches deep.

At Milford, crossing Darby creek, is another two-span covered deck Milford, deck Howe truss bridge, which, in style of construction and dimensions of principal parts, is almost an exact counterpart of that at Delaware. This was built in 1862. It rests on a stone pier and stone masonry abutments. Its timbers appear to be sound, and a careful examination developed no specific points of weakness anywhere. It has 10 panels, each 6 feet 6 inches long. Depth of truss is 8 feet. Lower chord, 4 and 5 by 12 inches; upper, 5, 11, 5 by 11 inches. Main braces, 6 by 9 inches throughout.

During the year the Ohio railway companies consumed 94,277 cords of wood and 2,662,729 tons of coal, costing $6,121,040.73. This is an increase in the cost of fuel for the year of $1,465,047.05, or 31.5 per cent. This great in- crease, perhaps, is due in some degree to the difference in the time of purchas- ing fuel, this year and last. PASSENGER TRAFFIC.

The passen- ger depot there owned and occupied exclusively by this road is a model building of its kind for convenience, comfort, and adaptability to its intended purpose. It contains in its upper story all the business offices of the railroad, while the lower is entirely used for ticket office, baggage, freight, and express rooms, and contains also separate waiting rooms for passengers, each being supplied with every desirable conven- ience, and the entire building being always kept scrupulously clean throughout by persons hired apparently for that purpose only. At way stations on the road are found small, neatly built station buildings, con- taining baggage and waiting rooms and a telegraph office. The terminus at Cleveland has not yet been decided upon. The place where passenger trains now stop being three-quarters of a mile from the locality desired. The enormous cost of the right of way and construction of the road from its present to this proposed stopping place has apparently thus far deterred the company from incurring an outlay, which appears to be out of all proportion to the immediate advantages to be derived from it, but which, nevertheless, must be faced sooner or later if the road is to take its well merited rank among the important railroad tributaries of Cleveland. Its facilities for handling freight, coal, and ore at Cleveland are ex- cellent, and apparently adequate for any development of its transport- ing resources. The company owns some hundred feet of dock front on the Cuyahoga river, just above its own iron bridge, and has yard room for from ten to twelve parallel side tracks along this dock. Six of these are already constructed. There are also on its dock two trav- eling steam revolving cranes. Sherrodsburg, the present southern ter- minus of one branch of the road, is only a temporary stopping place, from which the line will soon be further extended. There is here a coal branch to the Ohio and New York Company&apos;s mine, one mile long. The present resources of the road for coal are mines along the line be- tween Canton and Dell Roy, at distances from one-half to one and one- half miles from it. The greater portion of these are of recent origin, and not yet fully developed. Business and terminal fa- citities. Freight. The most important-in fact the real line-of the Connotton Valley Extensions. Railroad will be that from Canton to the coal fields of Coshocton, Mus- kingum, and Perry counties when it shall have been completed, be- cause it will be a direct line to Cleveland from those points, and very much shorter than any now in operation. A small repair shop belonging to the road is in Canton. Its capacity Repair shops. is very limited, and scarcely up to the requirements of the road. There is here, also, a shed for sheltering passenger cars, and a round-house with pits for six engines. At Dell Roy and Sherrodsburg there are also frame round-houses with room for three engines in each. The passenger equipment is first-class, and consists of twenty-two coaches. The company owns extensive grounds at Congress lake, ten miles north of Canton, which have, at considerable expense, been made quite at- &quot; &quot;1210 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

Steel rails are being laid down at numerous places along the whole road. From Springfield east, for several miles in one stretch, we find steel rails. Also from Galloway to the Asylum, steel. On a heavy and long grade from Georgesville east, track is all in excellent condition. Also north of Springfield, steel rails at numerous points. This year 36 miles of steel rail will be laid. Weight of steel rail, 56 pounds per yard. The iron rail is partly with fish-plate fastenings and approved modern section, and partly of the old 20 feet lengths and chair fasten- ings. The ties, on such parts of the road as have steel rails, are sound and good. On some other parts there are decayed ones interspersed with sound ones, though the conition of the ties has been very much im- proved during the year by new ties being added among the old. A great deal of improvement of the permanent way has been made during the past year, by the putting in of new ties, new steel rail, re- newing and repairing of culverts and bridges, and in temporarily doctoring such structures as are still able for further service as to soundness, but light for the present rolling loads. The new road from Springfield west is in excellent shape for a road of its age. The rai&apos;s are 60 pounds per yard, and laid on good ties, and with excellent gravel ballast. The company is unusually fortunate in finding on the line a large bank of the very best gravel for ballast. The bridging of this part of the road is also apparently fully up to what that of a new road should be. The qualification “apparently&amp;quot; is used here, because the new and peculiar bridges west of Springfield appear to be admirable structures, and must be so if the iron is fully up to what it needs to be in quality, a matter which can only be as- sured by the most careful tests and inspection which must be carried on during construction. While this is supposed to have been done, yet it is but fair to this report to say that the examinations here re- ported have been of such a nature that opportunity for assurance as to quality of iron has not been presented. The new road west of Springfield appears to have been designed for heavy rolling stock, and the plan of the company seems to be to introduce such rolling stock now, including the 80-ton consolidation engines with tender, not only on that part of the road, but to make it go on the older portions of the road. This has necessitated a gen- eral strengthening of previously existing structures throughout the road formerly known as the C. S. &amp;amp; C., from Columbus via Springfield to Sandusky. The want of fitness of this road, viz.: The former C. S. &amp;amp; C., for such heavy engines has doubtless not only caused delay for the insuf- ficient lengths of sidings, but accidents from a too great pressure upon the comparatively light, or rather the old 56-pound iron rail yet in use, and the yielding structures from lightness and age. However, the large amount of work which has been accomplished on this road in &quot; &quot;164 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. Remark. Dry run, 5 miles from Harrison. 1879. Remarks. Miami river, The lower chord has 4 timbers, 7 by 15 inches; the top has the usual depth, less than the lower by 2 inches. Masonry is good, and the abutments and embankment are well rip-rapped. On the older portion of the track there is a fair amount of good stone ballast, and the road is in good condition. Pony truss, four spans, each having 8 panels of 6 feet; height, 64 feet. The lower chord has three pieces, 4, 8, and 4 inches by 12; the other chord, two inches less in depth. Main braces, 6 by 7 inches; the counters, 5 by 6 inches. Lower laterals, 6 by 6 inches. The sus- pension rods are double, and vary from 1 to 12 inches. The floor is like that last described. The piers and abutments are good. The track to Harrison is moderately well ballasted, but in pretty fair condition, considering the amount of traffic. Pony Howe deck of 8 spans; each span has 10 panels, each 5 feet; one mile from 7 feet high, and 14 feet broad. Lower chord is composed of four the Law- renceburg Junction. 1874. Tunnel. Mud Run. pieces, 6 by 12 inches; the upper the usual 2 inches less. The main braces are 7 by 9 inches; the counters, 6 by 7 inches. The suspen- sion rods are double, and run from 1 down to 1 inches. Flooring, 8 by 4 inches, at 5 inches interval. There is no guard rail; but I was assured that the floor would be shortly renewed, and the ribbons be added then. There are 4 sway braces in each panel, 8 by 10 inches. Some of the packing blocks are much decayed, with the necessary accompanying deterioration of the adjacent chords. The piers are the old aqueduct piers built for the canal, and they are all more or less battered by the successive yearly poundings given by the ice; yet the strength is not yet diminished to any great extent. This is the old canal brick tunnel, 1,400 feet long, and 24 feet wide; all in good condition, except a small space near the north end. Pony Howe of 12 panels, 6 feet each; 9½ clear height, and of the usual width. Floor, close and good. The lower chord has three pieces, 6, 8, and 6 inches respectively, and 14 inches deep; the upper chord, 2 inches less in depth. The main braces are 8 by 10 inches; the coun- ters, 5 by 6 inches. The lower laterals are 6 by 7 inches, and rods 1 inch. The suspension rods are double, and run from 1 to 13 inches. There is a set of sway braces at each end. The corbels are 10 feet long on the east and west trestle approach to the bridge. The guard rails are small, and not very effective. Near the middle of the bridge are rotton packing blocks, like those above named. The bridge can not last much. longer, possibly a year or two. The east and west approaches have each 5 panels, 14 feet each, and at the end next the bridge the track is 30 feet from the ground. This structure stands side by side with the O. and M. bridge over the same stream; the timbers are a little stronger in this. The frame abutment posts are 14 by 14 inches; the caps, 14 by 16 inches; the ver- tical posts, 12 by 14 inches; and the batter posts, 12 by 12 inches. There is a horizontal lateral brace midway of the posts, and double sway braces on the timbers of the bents. &quot; &quot;770 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

Just south of this is a trestle 415 feet long, and of 20 feet average height. It is well braced, latterally and longitudinally, and in good repair, having been but recently renewed. The cross ties are 6 by 8 inches, spaced 12 inches apart, and the track stringers, 12 by 12 inches, 30 feet long; bents in this trestle being 15 feet from center to center. At Niles the first structure is a seven-panel Howe truss bridge, 72 feet long. The lower chords are 6, 64, 61, 6 by 12 inches. End main braces, 7 by 10 inches, and tie rods, double, 14 inches diameter. Floor beams are 6 by 14 inches, four per panel. Track stringers, 8 by 10 inches. The bridge has neither ties nor guard rails. The next is an eight-panel low Howe truss bridge, 48 feet long, over the track of the The floor beams in this are suspended. They are 6 by 14 inches, two in each panel. Track stringers are 8 by 10 inches, and the bridge has no ties nor guard rails. The track stringers and other parts are affected by decay in many places. Adjacent to the foregoing is a two-span Howe truss bridge, 240 feet long, over the Mahoning river. The first span contains 14 panels, and the second 10, each being 10 feet long. The bridge rests on good stone masonry abutments and a stone center pier. The lower chords, which are continuous throughout both spans, are 6, 6, 6, 6 by 14 inches, with iron packing. The end main braces are 9 by 10 inches, and the tie rods, three in number, are two, 2 inches, and one, 1 inches in diame- ter. The floor beams are 6 by 14 inches, four in each panel. Track stringers, 8 by 11 inches. There are four broken angle irons. In the first span the inner piece of the lower chord in the second panel south of the center, on the east side, has a fracture extending entirely across the top, and as far as I was able to ascertain, into the piece to a depth of more than two inches. A careful examination of the lower surface of this piece gave no indication that the fracture referred to extended through the piece, and could not be due, therefore, to a tensile strain. I do not consider this as weakening to any dangerous extent the bridge in which it was found, and only mention it that it may not appear to have been entirely overlooked. The trestle approach on the south end of this bridge is very old, and many of its parts need renewal. The ties are light, 6 by 6 inches, and space 22 inches from center to center. North of Girard are two trestles, one containing 6, and one, 14 spans of 15 feet from center to center of supports. In these, the bent timbers are 12 by 12 inches, ties 6 by 8 inches, 12 inches apart; guard rails, 4 by 6 nches. The bents have two plumb and two batter posts, and ground sill is on low stone walls. The works are both in good con- dition as regardssoundness of timbers. Immediately south of Girard there is another eleven span trestle like the above. Bridge No. 19, trestle.

The wooden guard rails are at end of ties close against inside of parapet. The bridge is covered with a plank floor, and is used also as a wagon bridge. The bottom chord is as fol- lows: End panel, two 10-inch channel bars, latticed; second panel, same; third, four bars, by 4 inches; fourth, four bars, 1 by 5 inches; fifth, four bars, 1 by 5 inches; sixth, two bars, 1 by 5 inches, and four, by 5 inches.

There is one span of the same kind on the east end of the draw- bridge, and the approach from the east end to this is a 630-foot pile trestle. The draw is an iron Pratt truss, built in Clinton, Iowa, and although in use at this date, not entirely completed in all its details. Many of the parts were inaccessible, and details of the structure are not at pres- ent available. The entire length is 340 feet. It rests on a stone ma- sonry center pier, which is supported on pile foundations. It is worked by steam power, and may also be turned by hand. The class of bridges in use on the Wheeling and Lake Erie R&apos;y is, with the single exception of an iron draw-bridge over Portage river, the combination Pratt and Howe truss, and the wooden Howe truss. The trestles are, as a rule, all pile trestles, fourteen feet span, and sup- ported by four piles, which are braced longitudinally and transversely. With the exception of three spans wooden Howe truss bridges over at Oak Harbor, which were built by Hamilton &amp;amp; Co., all bridges on the road were built by the Smith Bridge Company, of Toledo. They are, for the same length of span, almost exact duplicates. A large number of these were measured, and dimensions of parts ascertained. They were, for the various spans, examined as follows: 9 At Oak Harbor, combination Pratt on pile bent abutments, over L. S. &amp;amp; M. S.

Guard rail, wood, 6 by 6 inches, and 8 inches outside. An inside guard rail of iron railway rail, 3 inches from track rail. All guard rails go over bridge and trestle ap- proaches. The covering of roof is of double boarding breaking joints. Between the rail the covering slopes to middle, with gutter open through. Water falling between rails all flows down, dripping upon floor beams, lateral braces and sway braces. The latter carry water upon lower chord. Floor beams beginning to show decay from this cause. Α gutter to collect this water into conductors seems desirable. Abut- ments are good stone masonry in the form of T-walls. The bridge seats in masonry are 5 feet broad and 10 feet below lower chord of truss. Bridge is here supported on three framed trestles 10 feet high at each abutment and pier. The west approach is a long, heavy embankment to within 80 feet, which is a trestle 10 feet high, standing on the stem of the T wall abut- ment. These trestles are of two batter-posts, a sill and cap, of 10 by 12-inch timber, with two braces crossing inside of 8 by 8 inches, pine. Center to center of trusses, 10 feet. The trestle is to a steeper grade than bridge or embankment. At 100 feet from the bridge the drop in the rail line is 12 inches. : The east approach is like the west, but the rails are in more correct line. The timber in this bridge and approaches is all sound, and the whole structure is in good condition, with the exception of the guttering re- ferred to. The lateral bracing appears rather light for the span. Also the main truss rods are light for train and freight weights as used on some roads at present. A train, for instance, of two locomotives, of 56 feet each in length, and 2,640 lbs. per foot, followed by loaded freight cars of 2,000 lbs. per foot, will cause a strain of 19,000 lbs. per square inch in the bodies of the end panel main truss rods, and some 22,000 lbs. at the bottom of the threads, if the rods are not upset. This is about double the strain usually allowed. With a uniform train load &quot; &quot;1348 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

At Richland Furnace, in Vinton county, is a rock tunnel, 300 feet long; and two short arched tunnels. This is a deck Howe Truss, 60 feet long, and 10 feet high, 14 feet wide, with rods from 1 to 1 inches diameter, and braces, all 6 by 6 inches. The chord is triple, 6, 8, and 6 inches, respectively, and 13 inches deep. Each 99 feet long, having 10 panels, and both rebulit in the month of August, 1881. These new bridges are Howe Trusses and are exactly alike, having timbers of the following dimensions: the lower chord is quadruple, two pieces being 6, and the others, 6 inches by 13 deep; the upper chord is 11 inches deep, other dimensions same as above. The main braces vary from 9 by 10 to 7 by 10 inches; the counters all being 7 by 8 inches. The suspension rods are in sets of three; the center panel having rods each 1 inch in diameter; thence varying toward the abutment, the last being, two rods, 1 inch, and one, 1½ inch; width, 14 feet; depth of truss, 20 feet. The abutments are made of large stone, yet the stone is not strong or capable of bearing much hard usage. But there is no danger at present. The ditches along this part of the road are in bad condition; they are not deep enough, and do not properly drain the road-bed. The streams are sluggish, and no damage is likely to be done by floods. Howe Truss, 110 feet long, 14 feet wide, and 204 feet clear height. The masonry is first class. There are 10 panels, each 10 feet. The ribbons are 8 by 10 inches, notched; the flooring is 6 by 8 inches, and 4 inches apart. The track stringers are double, and 5 by 12 inches. The lower chord has 4 pieces, 6 by 14 inches; the upper 12 inches deep. The main braces vary from 8 by 9 inches to 9 by 10 inches; the counters, all 7 by 9 inches; the rods triple, varying from 1 to 2 inches. An exact copy of 40 in all respects. Trestle three 30 feet trussed girders; the stringers are double, and are 8 by 15 inches. Besides these, there is an extra support under the end of the ties.

No. 2, a 3-span Howe deck, full covered. Over the Big Walnut creek. Rail to bottom, 45 feet. By the B. &amp;amp; O. Co. in 1862. Good masonry piers and abutments, in cement, on timber foundation, exept the west abutment, on native rock. Spans the west one, 110 feet, of 11 panels each, and two east spans of 100 feet each, of 10 panels each. Depth of truss, 18 feet; width, 10 feet. Each span has a trestle bent support near the middle, with counter braces filled to full braces by additional sticks at points near the mid- dle of trusses. The spans are thus shortened about half, and the tim- bers and rods in the chords are ample, and not given. The trestles consist of 4 plumb posts of 10 by 10 inch sticks, with two-story brac- ing. Bridge seats square, and about 8 or 10 feet wide. Wall plates, two, 8 by 12 inches, and one, 6 by 8 inches. Floor beams, four, 6 by 14 inches, and one, 8 by 14 inches per panel.

Laterals, 18-inch rods and 5 and 6 by 6 inch struts, top and bottom. Sway bracing of 6 by 6 inches, passing each other with a bolt through. Top chords continuous over the piers. Approaches: west one, the river bank; on the east is a very large and long embankment, except for a trussed girder near bridge, built like No. 177, near Sandusky. The timber in this bridge, though 20 years old, appears as fresh as though only 2 years old. The structure appears to have been well taken care of. The clamp locks in the splices of lower chord appear to be weakening slightly, but safe with the trestles.

All on good masonry abut- ments and piers. This is an excellent structure, and of fine workmanship. It is ac- knowledged to be rather light for present traffic. Trains pass at nearly full speed. The truss rods vibrate as a train goes over, causing the rods to clash against each other. Some rods have thus become worn upon one side to a depth of over a thirty-second of an inch. It is believed that the rods should be bound together with wire, with rubber between, at these points of abrasion.

The angle bar fastening is much used, but not altogether; but where not, the rails are notched for the spikes to prevent creeping, which has occurred where the fish-plate is used. The present adopted splice is the angle bar. Rails are full spiked. Rails are said to give but little warning of breakage, but generally go entirely through when they start to break. They break more at the 2nd hole for fish-plates than at other points. In winter they break more on sand and gravel ballast than on stone ballast. This is believed to be because the sand and gravel ballast retains water to freeze, thus forming a solid bed, devoid of elasticity in winter, which is not the case with stone ballast. Also, as a 2nd cause, the freezing sand and Remarks. Winter breaks. &quot; &quot;1444 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. LINE OPERATED UNDER LEASE-EMBRACED IN THIS REPORT, NOT INCLUDED ABOVE.

At Conneaut are principal repair shops of the portion of the road within Ohio. The round-house has 22 stalls. The machine shop is 80 by 100 feet. From Conneaut is a branch track to a gravel pit. Gauge of track, 4 feet 8 inches. The construction adopted for the several wide gorges and river val- leys, is possibly open to criticism for the numerous foundations re- quired. For instance, at the Cuyahoga Valley viaduct at Cleveland there are 100 independent piers of stone masonry about four or five feet square at top, and standing at about the same height above ground, each supporting the foot of an iron leg. These 100 small piers could have been replaced by about 10 substantial stone bridge piers for spans of 150 feet. As to quality of iron used in the bridges, can say that I have exam. ined a large number of sheets giving reports of machine tests, and on these have found evidence of the best of iron. An occasional &quot;re- jected&quot; seen on these sheets for bars not in bad condition, would indi- cate that the matter of quality of iron had been sufficiently guarded. It is believed that the quality of iron in the principal members of all iron bridges is good. &apos; &quot;1474 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. FREIGHT.

Maximum going north is the forty-five foot grade on the south slope to the summit, at Summit, Medina county. In hauling coal trains, much longer trains are taken by one engine from Summit northward than to Summit from southward, on account of the grades. For this reason trains are broken, and remade at Sum- mit. At this point weighing scales are located, and as the trains are made up the coal-loads are weighed. The cattle guard of this road, adopted as standard, is well marked in character, and believed to be one of the best in use in the State. For a full description and illustration see page 404 of last year&apos;s report of the Commissioner of Railways. The small structures of this road, such as cattle guards, culverts, and short, low trestles, are all in excellent condition, and give evidence of close attention to details, such as have to do with safety. In short, the whole road is in good condition; in fact, excellent for a north and south one. Respecting the quality of materials put into structures, a fair judg- ment of wood and stone may be obtained from the appearance of the same as seen in the structures, but for iron the case is different. The fact that the simplest mode of inspection for qualities of iron requires bending and breaking tests, debars the determination of toughness, tensile strength, elastic limit, etc., on the spot. Hence, nothing is stated respecting the goodness of the iron in the combination and other bridges of this road. The engines aro 40 tons weight. The smith shops have ten forges and a tool forge. The round-house has 18 stalls. Shops for repair of cars have a capacity for making six freight cars per week. The machine shop has 18 machines, including 2 hydraulic presses, engine, lathes, planers, etc., with power. &quot; &quot;1054 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. Highest. Lowest. Cents. Average.

Date of original charter and name of company: On the 4th day of November, 1878, a charter was obtained from the State of Penn- sylvania for the Pittsburgh and Chicago Railway from the terminus of the Pittsburgh, Newcastle and Lake Erie Railroad, in Beaver county, Pennsylvania, about forty-five miles west of Pittsburgh, to the Ohio State line, a distance of about fourteen miles. On the 10th day of May, 1881, another charter was obtained from the State of Pennsylvania for the New York, Pittsburgh and Chicago Railway, from a point near the mouth of the Mahoning river, in Lawrence county, Pennsylvania, to the city of Pittsburgh, a distance of about fifty miles. And on the 5th day of March, 1881, a charter was obtained from the State of Ohio for The New York, Pittsburgh and Chicago Railway, from the western terminus of the Pittsburgh and Chicago Railway, on the eastern boundary line of Columbiana county to the western boundary line of Marion county, a distance of about one hun- dred and seventy-five miles.

By Kellogg &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 439 Between Sandusky and Fremont there is a large number of low Trestles. trestles, ranging in length from 75 feet to 1,500 feet. They are as a rule 14 feet span between points of support, with 12 by 12-inch bent timbers, double 7 by 14-inch stringers under each rail, and one 7 by 14- inch stringer under end of ties. Ties are 6 by 8 inches, laid from 8 to 10 inches apart, and a wooden guard rail outside of track bolted to the ties. In two of these structures there is a low Howe truss span at or near the center. The works on this part of the line are only about three years old, and are, as appears from inspection, well built, and sound in timbers. The first large and important structure, at Fremont, crossing the channel and valley of Sandusky river, is a trestle combined with eight spans of a Howe truss bridge, the entire structure being 4,800 feet long. The bridge rests on stone masonry piers, which average 22 feet in height, and the trestle is from 18 to 20 feet high. The trestle sup- ports are framed bents of the usual form, whose lower sills rest on heavy piles. The trestle posts, caps, and sills, are 12 by 12-inch tim- bers. The bents are braced laterally by double sets of 3 by 10-inch cross braces, spiked to vertical and batter posts, and also by horizontal diagonal 6 by 6-inch timbers, which are bolted to the caps, and extend from bent to bent. Track stringers are 28 feet long, 7 by 14 inches in section. There are two of these under each rail, and one under each guard rail. The span of trestle bent is (the uniform standard on this road) 14 feet from center to center of supports. The north approach to the bridge, which is near the center of the entire structure, is on a two degree curge. The bridge is in two sections, with an interval of several spans of trestle between. The first, northern section, consists of three spans, each 139 feet long, 133 feet clear; and the next of four spans, 137 feet long, and one span 123 feet long. The height of truss is 22 feet. Number of panels, 12, each 11 feet 8 inches in length. The lower chord is 64, 71, 71, 64 by 14 inches, or 28 by 14 inches. Main braces, double, 7 by 10 inches in center, to 10 by 12 inches at ends. Counters, similarly, 7 by 12 inches in center, to 6 by 8 inches at ends. Tie rods, three in number, 1 inches diameter in center, to 2 inches at ends; also four end posts, each 6 by 8 inches. Floor beams, 7 by 14 inches, and 18 inches apart, or five to each panel. Stringers, two under each rail, 6 by 12 inches, and one, 6 by 12-inch end bearer under each guard rail. Ties are 6 by 8 inches, and 18 inches from centers, with a 6 by 6-inch guard rail, placed 30 inches outside of tracks. The same floor system is used on the trestle. For length of clear span, the dimensions of principal parts, as here given, exceed, with one excep- tion, those of any Howe truss bridge in Ohio that came under my ob- servation. It will be obvious from this that the officers having charge of this department of the road are preparing, in their new construc- tions, to meet every contingency of traffic. The stone masonry of bridge piers is first-class in material and workmanship. Fremont, trestle, com- Howe truss. bined with &quot; &quot;PITTSBURGH, FT.

For a mile from the main track at Parkersburg, the road belongs to the B. &amp;amp; O.

Ballast, ditches, ete. Station houses. No. 21, Fink creek. LONGITUDINAL SECTION. Each story of the bent is 20 feet high; the timber is foot-square oak, and the foundations vary in height according to the slope of the ground. The upper surface of the piers is 6 by 28 feet, with broader base. From Chillicothe westward the ballast is in medium quantity, and is chiefly stone; the bed is in fair condition; the fencing is very close to the track, and belongs to the farmers. The embankments and the cuts west of Chillicothe as far as any are found, are usually well sodded, but the ditches are not usually large enough for good drain- age. West of Greenfield the right of way was clear of weeds and bushes; the trimming was in progress in many places. New station houses, neat and commodious, have been erected at Jackson, Hamden, Byers&apos;s, and other points. Eastward of Blanches- ter the piers and abutments are not in danger from any ordinary flood. Sixty-four feet above the bed of the creek, it is 10 feet wide; has deck, Walnut floor beams 6 by 13 inches, 11 inches apart; there are four panels— the main bars are double inch bars, 4 inches deep; the bars are 2ğ by 3 inches. The ribbons are heavy, and are notched down and bolted; the cross-bracing is by small channel bars. Bridge good. &quot; &quot;CINCINNATI, INDIANAPOLIS, ST.

Many improvements have been made in the road-bed, track, and ballast since last year. With the exception of about twelve miles the entire line is now laid with fifty-six pound steel rail. Through the coal regions a portion of the road is ballasted with furnace slag, but as a rule gravel is used for this purpose. The fences along the road built by the railroad company are all in good condition. From Hadley Junction to Toledo the entire road is fenced. Between the former place and Corning fences are occasionally wanting. The bridges on 1 Summary of Finances and Business.

Whole number of arches, 37, 17 of them at west end being set to a four-degree curve of track. Between the lower course of coping and the keystone is a course of about 18 inches. A cross section of the viaduct, taken over the keystones and includ- ing part of them, is shown in the sketch. The space between the &amp;lt; 30&quot; 18 30% copings is devoted to the filling material of earth and gravel support- ing the sawed ties. The latter are 7 by 9 inches, lying flat, and 7 feet long. The ballast is broken stone, and extends to some inches below the ties. The ties are now all being renewed and the track put in ex- cellent condition. At the west end the arcade terminates in an embankment. Joint lines all appear perfectly straight along the length, the cut stone masonry being in excellent condition, the viaduct being a remark- ably fine and beautiful structure; built in 1870. The viaduct and all parts of this bridge are the property of the Main Line of the Virginia and Maryland Railway. &apos; &quot;628 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

At Logan the company owns a fine brick building, which serves as passenger station, eating house, and hotel. At Lan- caster and Athens the station buildings are used in common with roads crossing at those points. At other stations small buildings of the usual character serve as passenger depots, waiting and baggage rooms, and telegraph offices. The principal repair and construction shops belonging to the road are in Columbus, in the south-western part of the city. Machine and blacksmith shop of moderate capacity, and intended for light, transient repairs is also at Logan, and a small round-house and turntable at Pomeroy. The shops at Columbus are very complete and very exten- sive. They comprise a round-house, with a capacity for thirty-two locomotives; a fully equipped machine shop, furnished with the best modern appliances for the work for which they are intended, that are made; there is also a car repair shop, paint shop, and a large brick building used as office and general supply store. Nothing can give a better idea of the almost infinite necessities of a modern railroad than a look through this supply store, which contains such a miscellaneous collection of every conceivable article that might be needed as would exhaust the resources of the largest city hardware stores to furnish, either in kind or quantity. I am informed that the articles accumu- lated here, together with the raw material of lumber, iron, etc., kept in store around these buildings are valued at more than $130,000. There are employed in, about, and in direct connection with these shops in the capacity of mechanics, engineers, machinists, carpenters, fire- men, laborers, and in other ways ordinarily five hundred and eighty to six hundred men. A further addition to these shops, to contain facilities for foundry work, is contemplated. Extensive alterations in- volving the introduction of new boilers and additional engine power are now going on. In the north-western part of the city, near the Penitentiary, the company owns a round-house, with a capacity for nine locomotives, a car shed for passenger cars, and a building used as a paint and repair shop; also several unloading platforms for coal. The tracks of the company terminare here, its passenger trains to the Union Depot run- ning on the track of the P., C. &amp;amp; St. L. R. R., and its transfer freight business, with other roads centering in Columbus, being done by the company&apos;s own engines over the tracks of this and other roads to the yard about the freight and passenger depots of these different roads. The freight depot of the Hocking Valley Railway Company at Colum- bus is in the south-western part of the city, near the shops and round- houses already referred to. The road is pre-eminently a coal road. It penetrates the very head of the inexhaustible coal supplies of the Hocking Valley, and notwith- standing the fact that these mines pour their daily yield into its cars, &quot; &quot;344 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. The number of miles of 45 pound iron rail is 28, and of 56 pound, 4 miles. Number of miles laid during the past year, 8 of the 45 pound, and 4 of the 56 pound. No steel. A quantity of new rails are on hand, stacked ready for laying, sufficient for about five miles of track. The splice is by the fish plate, with four bolts; prefer the fish plate to angle bar on a soft bed. The stub switch is used. No trains are run by night. By day the signals are about as on the Ft. Wayne Road. No telegraph. Trains are run by time and schedule. A station building 18 by 20 feet at Shanes; at Van Wert, a passenger and freight, with offices, about 18 by 60 feet; one at Scott&apos;s Station, a half station building at Enterprise, and one going up at Paulding, are all the station buildings. For heating cars a box form of wood stove is used. Lighting is done with candles, though no light is required for night trains. Ordinary platforms and couplers are used, though one car has the Miller&apos;s. For wrecking tools only have jacks, ropes, blocks, etc. No special car. Air brakes only in use on engine. The company has small repair shop at Van Wert; also a house for oil and tools. A round-house is soon to be built at Van Wert, with three stalls. THE PAULDING AND CECIL R. R. Inspected September 7, 1882. This is a short line of about seven miles, operated in the interest of a blast furnace works near Cecil. A large amount of charcoal is used by this furnace, which is hauled from the dense wood land south of Cecil, by the railroad. For this reason the road does not at all depend upon passenger traffic, and heretofore but few passengers could have occasion to move over it. But the completion of the Cincinnati, Van Wert &amp;amp; M. R. R. to Paulding will greatly increase the travel between Paulding and Cecil. The north half of this road is in much better condition than the south half, the former being over comparatively dry land and partly 1 Summary of Finances and Business. Paulding and Cecil R. R.

An act of the Legislature of Ohio, passed April 14th, 1882, amending Section 3333 of the Revised Statutes of Ohio, made provision for the avoidance of the stop now required of all trains or engines passing over the crossing of two railroads that cross each other, or that in any way connect at a common grade, in terms following: &quot;Provided, however, and in case such two railroads crossing each other, or in any way con- necting at common grade, shall, by any works or fixtures to be executed by them, render it safe to pass over said crossing without stopping, and such works and fixtures shall first be approved by the Commissioner of Railroads and Telegraphs, and the plan of said works and fixtures for such crossing, designating the plan of crossing, shall have been filed with such Commissioner of Railroads and Telegraphs, then, and in that case the provisions of said section thirty-three hundred and thirty-three and the provisions of thirty-three hundred and thirty-four and thirty-five shall not apply.&quot; Now, since managers of railways in Ohio have made inquiry of the Commissioner of Railroads and Telegraphs, as to the essential principles that shall govern in such works and fixtures to be used for the safe running of trains at grade crossings of railways without stop, it is deemed proper that a statement of the requirements by the Commissioner shall be made. After a careful consideration of the subject, and consultation with Prof. S. W. Robinson, Civil and Mechanical Engineer of the Ohio State University, the following have been laid down as the rules necessarily governing in such appliances: Requirements in Appliances to be used at Grade Crossings of Railroads in Ohio, in order that Trains may Safely Cross without making the Stop otherwise required by Law. Any track on which trains are to approach, and, without stopping, cross over a second track intersecting the first at grade, it is deemed essential to safety- First-That such track be provided with a switch facing outward from the crossing, and which shall be capable of being set and locked by a lock on the switch itself, either to the main line or for derailing any train or locomotive approaching the crossing, and that the switch be set at such a distance that any train derailed by it will not be able to reach the crossing before coming to rest. Also, that this track be provided with at least two signals, one signification for both of which shall be &quot;danger,&quot; or &quot;stop;&quot; and the other &quot;safety,&quot; or &quot;clear;&quot; one of which signals is a near signal situated near the derailing switch and capable of being locked to danger, and the other a distant signal capable of being locked at danger and situated so far from the derailing switch that any train or locomotive moving past that signal can easily be brought to rest before reaching the derailing switch. Second-That this switch and two signals be interlocked in such a way that their operations must follow in certain sequence, and that for the normal condition, or when no trains are moving, the switch be set and locked to derailment, and the signals be set and locked to danger. Third―That the interlocking appliances so operate that when a train approaches to cross without stopping, the derailing switch be unlocked, set to line, and relocked by &apos; &quot;LAKE SHORE AND MICHIGAN SOUTHERN RAILWAY. 1159 34 8 G.

Delaware, Howe deck. of the work required on the road, such as plate and trussed girder bridges, split switches, etc., is being done in these shops. On the road-bed, within the year, much improvement has been made in laying new ties and ballast on the northern portion of the line in the vicinity of Cleveland. The line from Galion to Union City was not visited. A fuller report of the bridges on that line, as obtained from last year&apos;s inspection, is submitted. The construction department of the road is in the hands of men of high scientific attainments and much practical experience. The man- agement is very systematic, and the control and discipline of employes apparently strict. The plans of inspection of roadway and structures are much facilitated by office records, or inspection sheets, on which are set out in detail the most minute features of every bridge, culvert, water-way, crossing, etc., together with numbers and references, en- abling the managers of this department of the road to locate them with precision. From personal knowledge gained while accompanying some of the officers of this road on their tour of inspection, I am convinced that no inspection can exceed in thoroughness that made by these offi- cials. Accurate descriptions were taken on the spot of every defective point discovered in bridge, trestle, culvert, station building, etc. The exact nature of repairs needed was decided on at once, and the result of the decision entered as an order to the employes charged with the particular kind of work that was needed-this refers, of course, only to minor repairs. Changes involving greater expense were noted for reference to heads of departments of the road affected by them. 1. Cleveland to Columbus. Between Cleveland and Columbus, a distance of 137 miles, there is found one low (half) Howe truss bridge, containing two 40-foot spans, between Shiloh and Shelby Station, and one near Cardington of a simi- lar description, containing a single span, 55 feet long. All other bridges on this part of the road are iron truss, iron girder, or stone masonry arches. The standard floor system on these bridges is, 8 by 14 inch floor beams (in the Howe truss bridges referred to), placed 21 inches from center to center; track stringers, one, 12 by 12 inches, under each rail, and one, 6 by 12 inches, as an end bearer under each guard rail. Ties, 6 by 8 to 9 inches, and 7 inches apart. Height of truss, 8 feet. There are two sets of guard rails, one, 6 by 6 inches, placed 8 inches outside of track, and one at the end of ties, which are 12 feet long. 2. Cincinnati Division, Delaware to Dayton. At Delaware, on the Cincinnati division, there is a four-span wooden Howe truss covered deck bridge, nearly twenty years old. The spans are 54 feet clear, and the bridge rests on stone masonry abutments and piers. The truss height is 12 feet. Lower chord in three parts, 5, 12, &quot; &quot;368 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. Switches. Latimer&apos;s Bridge Safety Guard. The angle-bar splice is standard. For creeping of rails, see proceed- ings of the meetings of the road-masters for 1875 and 1879. The Wharton switch is objected to for the rise in the elevating rail, where speed may be considerable. The safety spring as in the Lorenz switch is objected to and not used. A split switch is much used which has a very stiff safety spring in the connecting rod-so stiff that a switchman cannot readily force it against obstructions, such as a lump of coal or a pebble which might get caught in the point, and thus, left partially open, derail a train. The stiff spring gives ample warning to the switchman, when turning the switch, that something is wrong. But the spring will yield for a car-truck running through wrong, and thus no breakage nor derailment occurs. The switches have a cast brace-chair at outside and opposite rail point, the chair having a shoe- plate extending through under the rail to make a bearing for the pointed rail. This shoe is here elevated about a half inch, as pointed out by he Chief Engineer, Mr. Charles Latimer, thus preventing the de- pression of the pointed rail so far as to get the outer edge of the tread of wheels between the main rails. Probably derailments have occurred by such depression of point rail. The latter should always be carried on iron bed-plates, set solid on firm ties if not on chair-bed extension. The re-railing device patented by Engineer Latimer, which is found at the approaches of quite a number of the bridges of this road, and known as Latimer&apos;s Bridge Safety Guard, has been the means of saving several wrecks. A number of instances have been cited. In some cases the train men did not discover the casualty of actual derailment of cars of a train, they being brought on by this device, when the marks of the wheels on the ties have shows it. The device is believed to be of sufficient importance to illustrate by aid of a cut shown here. CROSS-SECTION. AT A The heavy parallel lines are the main line rails at the bridge ap- proach. Inside is a lozenge, or parallelogram, formed of rails, 48 feet long, point to point. Between this and the main line rails is a casting, low and thin at the ends, but rising to near the wheel flanges at the middle. This is lower next to the main line rail than at the parallelo- gram grail, so that a wheel rising on it will be raised so that its tread &quot; &quot;112 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

On this part of the road there is a continuous succession of short, sharp curves, side hill cuts, a few embankments, and an unusual number of high wooden trestles and bridges. To a casual observer it appears, on a superficial exam- ination of the line of road and its surroundings, that by the exercise of less haste and more judgment in the original location of the road, many of its disadvantageous features could have been avoided. This view is also held by persons officially connected with the road at pres- ent, and, therefore, well acquainted with it. In the entire line, 98 miles in length, there is an aggregate of 32,000 lineal feet of wooden bridges and trestles, or approximately, 6 per cent. of the entire line is over wooden bridges and trestles. The majority of these have reached an age when their strength is fast giving way, in fact, many have already been entirely renewed within the last four years, and a large permanent force of carpenters is constantly engaged, without intermission of work, as I am informed, in repairing and re- constructing these works. In making these renewals the bridges and trestles are being not only repaired, but in many instances entirely rebuilt on a new system, and one more in consonance with present requirements. In the original structures the vertical and batter posts are of various dimensions, being in cross section 9 by 10 inches, 10 by 10 inches, 10 by 12 inches, and in some cases round logs, 9 by 10 inches, and 12 inches in diameter. In new work all such parts as posts, sills, caps, and corbels are of oak, 12 by 12 inches in section. The span of trestles is, uniformly, as a standard, 15 feet from center to center of points of support; the ties are 6 by 8 inches, placed 4 inches apart, and there is a 5 by 6-inch wooden guard rail bolted to them, 8 inches outside of the track. Track stringers on this standard span of 15 feet are 30 feet in length, double, 7 by 14 inches, oak, or 14 by 14 inches, single, under each rail. For 18 and 20 feet spans, track-stringers are double, 9 by 14 inches. For spans over 20 feet, and up to 33 feet, they consist of two pieces, 12 to 14 inches in section, laid one above another, and trussed with two, 13 to 2 inch iron rods. The height of truss in new wooden Howe truss bridges is 22 feet, and clear roadway, 14 feet. The ballast of the road is stone, furnace, and coal mine slack and gravel. The road is now managed as the Marietta Division of the Wheeling and Lake Erie, and forms the Southern portion of the Toledo and Marietta through line of that railroad. Within the year very extensive improvements have been made in the way of strengthening wooden structures, ballasting with furnace cinders, and filling up several long and high trestle works with earth.

No precautions are taken at curves or grades, except sometimes a guard rail is put in the track when a curve is near a bridge. The Wharton and split switches are standard. Trains run as on the other divisions, by schedule and dispatcher. At Bellaire the track runs along the river, with facilities for discharg ing freight to the river boats and to other railroads. The right of way is usually 66 feet; a considerable portion is 100 feet, and a small portion is 60 feet. The standard barbed wire fence is stated to be: first wire, 7 inches above ground; second, 9 inches higher; third, 11 inches higher; fourth, a board 6 inches wide, with lower edge 15 inches above the first wire below it. Ballast in gravel, 137 miles; stone, 1 1-5 miles; coal cinder from locomotives, 17 miles; furnace slag, 27 miles. Ties are oak and cedar, 7 inches thick, by 8 to 12 inches wide; age about 7 to 8 years; standard number, 16 per 30-foot rail. During past year laid 100,000 ties. They cost 55 cents for the Virginia ties. Have had some trouble with the creeping of rails before steel was put down. Now the steel and angle-bar splice remains without creep. At two deep cuts flagmen are stationed for safety. The station buildings are mostly passenger and freight combined. Buildings are mostly wood; three are brick, viz., one at Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, one at Dover, and one at New Philadelphia. The Winslow stove for hard coal, is used for heating. For lighting, the Mineral Seal oil is employed. The platform is the Cowell&apos;s, with the Janney coupler. Two crane cars and two tool cars are used for wrecking purposes. The Westinghouse automatic brake is standard, with cord through cars accessible to passengers. Construction and repair shops at Cleveland have capacity for 10 box cars per week and 24 coaches per year. At Wellsville the shops have about the same capacity. At Cleveland have one 20 and one 16-stall round-house. At Wells- ville is a round-house of 30, and one of 6 stalls. At Bellaire is one of 6 stalls. At New Philadelphia one of 3 stalls. At Baird one of 2 stalls, and at Ravenna one of 2 stalls. The ditches here are formed preferably by placing sods on the sides toward the track and allowing grass to grow, thus preventing the gravel from being wasted into the ditches. The latter are much more easily kept clean with this arrangment. Bottom of ditch 1 to 2 feet below top of rods. The gravel ballast surface is dressed to a convex curve in the cross section, rising just to the top of the ties in the middle of the track. The standard engine and tender of the C. &amp;amp; P. R.

The lateral and vertical motion of the bridge under the weight of a locomotive is very great. I stood on the middle of the north span, which is the weakest, in order to see; and speak, therefore, from pos- itive knowledge. Down to this point, the above is the statement for 1881. In 1882, all three of these bridges had been strengthened by supports resting on piles. Under the bridge at Rees&apos;s Station, the supports are at the quarter points; in the others, they are at a distance of one panel from the abutments. The supporting beam beneath the bridge is upheld at each end by four piles, which are all joined together by two sets of horizontal, and one set of diagonal braces, all well bolted, making the support better than the bridge. The flooring also has been overhauled and put in better condition. Over the Scioto at Chillicothe; has three spans of 150 feet each, of the usual height and width adopted on this road. In one of the spans 8 castings are broken; in another, 9; in the third, 11; making 28 crushed castings in the bridge. All these are on the lower chord. It was im- practicable at the time of my visit to examine the castings of the upper chord. In 1882 the south abutment was rebuilt, and set further into the stream, so the span is diminished by 25 or 30 feet. Strong pile sup- ports also have been similarly placed at the distance of two panels from each end of the spans; and while this pile support stands the struc- ture may be considered safe for a year, or possibly longer, but there is danger in case of a flood or heavy floating ice, that the supports may be carried away. 2. Trestles, from Columbus to Chillicothe. Roadway near Columbus; 116 feet total. The panels vary from 10 to 16 feet. Stringers, 12 by 14 inches. Ribbons, 4 by 8 inches, notched. Ties, 5 by 10 inches, and 1 foot apart. Corbels, 6 feet, and 12 inches square; about 15 feet high. There is a trussed girder, say 30 feet long, with 3 chord pieces, 4, 8, and 4 inches wide, and 14 inches deep, and 2-inch rods on each side.

The new steel rail adopted for the line is 60 pounds, 22 miles of which is already down. An unusually large annual installment of rails is now on hand, and will soon be in the track. It seems impossible, however, for the present rate of extension of steel to be adequate for the necessarily rapid future retirement of the old rail. Superintendent Morris appears to be full of energy and good judgment in utilizing the means at his command, but it appears impossible-short of a miracle, to maintain the safety and credit of this line for the next five years without a more lib-ral supply of material aid. The standard bridge floor is the same as for the other portion of the Pennsylvania Company&apos;s lines, as already described. The sharpest curve is stated, by the road-master, to be 4 degrees. Grades are named as high as 60 feet to the mile. The elevation of the outer rail is stated as being inch per degree. The track appears to be in fair condition. The right of way is here mostly 100 feet, though some is 66 feet. The fences are three-fourths board, good, part of the remainder being rail fence. The standard fence consists of barbed wire, the first wire being 9 inches from the ground, the second 9 inches higher, the third 10 inches still higher, the fourth piece being a 6-inch board with the lower edge 10 inches above the third wire, and then a fourth wire 6 inches above the top of the board, all being about 44 feet high. There are 15 miles of stone ballast near Toledo, under the steel, and 9 miles in strips at other points, 24 miles in all. Average The ties are oak, 7 inches thick by 8 to 12 inches face. duration, 7 years in stone and 4 years in gravel. They are laid 2,640 per mile. Number laid since last year, 50,068. Average present cost, 42 cents. No new iron rails have been laid during the past year, but 5 miles of steel have been put in. The fastenings are the angle-bar splice on steel and fish-plate on iron. No creeping of rails has been experienced. No special precautions have been found necessary at curves or grades. The Wharton switch is used for the steel, and the stub switch for iron. Trains are run by schedule and train dispatcher. At Toledo the company has 800 feet of dockage front in order, and 1,400 feet frontage not yet utilized. Have 10 tracks, averaging 700 or 800 feet long, between the depot and docks. The freight building at Toledo is 50 by 300 feet, of brick, on pile and timber foundations and stone wall. The Bissell&apos;s heater is in use on passenger cars. For light- ing cars 300° oil is used. The Janney platforms and coupler are in use; also the Westinghouse automatic air brake, with cord accessible to passengers.

[SEAL.] &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 463 the wonderful transportation capacity, aided by the terminal handling facilities of the road enable it to meet the demands upon its resources. The loaded coal cars are collected from the various mines, and formed at Nelsonville and Logan into trains averaging thirty loaded cars each, and occasionally going to thirty-five. A number of trains that I counted between Logan and Columbus had from twenty-eight to thirty- one loaded cars. These trains are taken by one locomotive to Colum- bus. There what is not required for local consumption, or taken for further transportation by other roads, is again made up into trains con- taining about thirty cars each, and sent on to Toledo. At Fostoria, 35 miles from Toledo, three of these trains are sometimes consolidated and taken into Toledo as two, one engine thus being relieved for other duty. The local demand for coal at Columbus is stated at one hundred car loads per day on an average throughout the year, and of this the Hocking Valley Railroad claims to supply 80 per cent., or about twelve hundred tons per day. The coal traffic seems to be occasionally spas- modic in character. Less than two weeks before the date of my in- spection I was informed that this company had 4,000 (a line more than twenty miles long) empty freight (coal) cars on its hands. At date of inspection demands were made for cars which could not be furnished, because none were available. At Columbus the entire business of the three divisions of the road is concentrated, and must be accommodated. To accomplish this taxes to the utmost the capacious and well arranged facilities of the road in the way of yard, side, and transfer tracks. The arrangement now con- templated to construct (or rather extend those already laid out) a series of side tracks in two localities, one on each side of the shops and round-house, one to be a yard for north and the other for south bound trains-will aid materially in facilitating and simplifying making up trains. The supply stations for delivery of coal for local consump- tion at Columbus are convenient in situation, but in some instances leave room for improvement in the mechanism for loading from the dumps and platforms upon the wagons. They are at short intervals along the line of the road from the point where the road crosses the canal to the terminus close by the south wall of the Penitentiary, and encompass the west side of the city for a distance of more than a mile. They are especially convenient in situation for the many ext nsive manufacturing establishments situated in that vicinity. In Pomeroy and Gallipolis inclines have recently been constructed by means of which freight may be received from and discharged into vessels on the Ohio river at any stage of water. At Pomeroy the incline is such that cars can be let down and drawn up directly by the ordinary locomotive. At Gallipolis the inclination is very steep, and the freight is transferred to cars drawn up and down by steam power, with wire cables. This apparatus had no sooner been put into operation than it developed a trade in hard wood lumber, railroad ties, wheat, etc., which promises soon to outgrow the capacity of the machinery now &quot; &quot;CINCINNATI SOUTHERN RAILWAY. 863 ROAD ACQUIRED BY PURCHASE AND TOTAL COST FOR CONSTRUCTION AND PURCHASE.

PORTER, Notary Public, Hamilton County, Ohio. &quot; &quot;436 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. Freight and passenger stations. Howe truss. Duck creek ⚫ bridges. Howe truss. To date, an aggregate of twenty miles of the road has been so ballasted, ditched and resurfaced. The most glaring deficiency on the road is still the want of freight and passenger station buildings. It can be safely said that there is on the entire line not one structure deserving the name of passenger sta- tion, in the sense in which that term is usually understood, namely, as a building affording shelter and convenience to the public while await- ing arrival or departure of trains. At Marietta, people stand on the street, and their baggage is dumped there, also, until the train arrives or departs. At Newcomerstown there is a small wooden building con- taining two rooms, one used as telegraph office and the other contain- ing a few rickety benches. This comes nearer to being a station than any other on the road that came under my observation. At nearly every other station on the road the only conveniencies were a decayed wooden platform and a small, one-room board shanty or a room occu- pied as country store, which was presumably open for the use of pass- engers. While this state of affairs continues no display of energy or enterprise in bettering the physical condition of the road will be appre- ciated or even noticed by the general public. The ordinary passenger will base his judgment of the condition and management of a road more upon the architectural appearance and conveniencies of the pass- enger station buildings, which he sees and must use, than upon the steel rails, which he does not see, and the stone ballast, which he does not notice. Good station houses, though not essential to the safety of passengers, are certainly necessary for their comfort. The principal structures on the road are several wooden Howe truss bridges, over Duck creek, Wills creek, and a two-span Howe truss bridge over the Tuscarawas river, near Newcomerstown. Also, three tunnels. There is, as has been stated, a large number of short-span trussed wooden beam bridges and wooden trestles. Of the Duck creek bridges, the following, near Belle Valley, will serve as standard, (this being one of the new structures): Howe truss, 8 panels, each 9 feet ten inches long, 21 feet 11 inches deep. Pile bent foundations. Lower chord, 6, 6, 6, 6 by 12 inches; upper, 6, 6, 6, 6 by 10 inches; floor beams, 7 by 14 inches, 4 per panel; stringers, 10 by 12 inches; ties, 5 by 8 inches, and 4 inches apart. Guard rails, 6 by 6 inches, twelve inches from rail; main braces, 9 by 10 to 74 by 10 inches; counters, 6 by 8 inches; rods, at ends, two, 18 and one, 1 inches; second panel, two, 14 inches, and one, 1 inches; third panel, two, 13 inches and 14 inches; center panel, three, 1-inch. Near Cambridge, over Wills creek, there is also a wooden Howe truss bridge, nearly new, which contains twelve panels, each 10 feet long. It rests on pile bent abutments. Depth of truss, 22 feet; chords, 6, 7, 7, 6 by 12 and 14 inches; braces, 9 by 11 to 7 by 11 inches; counters, 8 by 8 inches; tie rods, at ends, two, 2 inches, and one, 14 inches diam- eter, and diminishing by -inch diameter toward center; floor beams, &quot; &quot;1350 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

From the census of 1880 it was learned that the product of coal in the United States was- Bituminous Anthracite Making a total of………………………………….. ..... 41,860,055 tons. 28,621,371 tons. 70,481,426 tons. An idea of this quantity may be gained by considering it in car loads. A standard load of coal is fifteen tons. There would then be in the above quantity 4,705,428 car loads. Each car of coal, if of the dimensions of the coal cars of the C. H. V. &amp;amp; T. R&apos;y, would occupy thirty-one and one-half feet. The train of such cars, with fifteen tons each, would be 146,258,881 feet in length, or 27,700 miles. This would make a train of loaded cars reaching around the world, with a train 2,800 miles long in excess; or twelve trains on an air line from New York to San Francisco, with 964 miles to spare. The tonnage of the railways of the United States in 1880 was 290,897,395 tons; of this, 89,622,899 tons were coal. It will be seen from these figures that 30 per cent. of all the transportation is in coal. No other product at all compares with it in tonnage. Grain stands next in quantity, being 42,003,504 tons, or about 14 per cent. of the whole tonnage. The third is classed as &amp;quot;lumber and other products,&amp;quot; amounting in tonnage to 25,474,349 tons, or a little over 8 per cent. of the entire tonnage. THE PRODUCT OF COAL IN OHIO IN 1880 Was, bituminous, 5,932,853 tons, or 395,523 car loads, making a train 2,261 miles in length, equivalent to twelve solid trains of coal on the railroad from Columbus to Indianapolis (198 miles), or three solid trains of coal on the railway from Columbus to the city of New York, with 33 miles of car loads in excess of that distance. COAL TRANSPORTATION BY HOCKING VALLEY RAILWAY IN 1882. There were shipped from the Hocking Valley, by the C. H. V. &amp;amp; T. R&apos;y, in 1882, 1,739,936 tons of coal, or in car loads, 115,996, which would make a train 872 miles in length, or seven solid trains of coal on the C. &amp;amp; T. Road (124 miles) reaching from Columbus to Toledo, and a train of 4 miles of car loads in excess of that distance. In the State of Ohio the tonnage was, in 1880, 48,511,186 tons; of this, 11,186,006 tons were coal, or 23 per cent., exceeding any production of the State.

Road-bed. VI. THE ALLIANCE AND LAKE ERIE RAILROAD,&apos; from Alliance, Ohio, to Phalanx, Ohio. A narrow gauge road connecting Alliance, on the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway, with Phalanx, a station on the Mahon- ing branch of the N. Y., P. &amp;amp; O. R. R. The line is twenty-five miles long. As regards grade of the road-bed, it follows to a great extent the natural surface of the country over which the road passes. Until very recently there was no ballast on any part of the road, owing to the difficulty of obtaining any suitable material for this purpose on or in the vicinity of the line. Ties are in fairly good condition, but many broken ones were found. The iron rail is light, and very much out of surface and alignment, and gives indication of the unusual wear and strain to which it is subjected by reason of the rough and unsubstan- tial character of the road-bed. Within the year some effort has been made to supply the deficiency in ballast by using coal mine slack. It seems to answer a good tem- porary purpose. Several new station houses have been built along the line, and a passenger and freight station building at Alliance is nearly completed. A telegraph line has also been built. Much work in the nature of permanent improvement has been accomplished. Arrange- ments are now being made to connect this line with a new road from Alliance to Steubenville, which is in process of construction. The im- provements under way, which appear to depend largely upon the earnings of the road, were much set back by difficulties at the coal 1 Summary of Finances and Business.

No. 5, trestle, Palmyra. Trestles. The length of the entire work is 580 feet. The trestle is in style of construction and dimension of its several parts like No. 3, above de- scribed. The bridge rests on stone masonry abutments and center pier. Each span contains 8 panels each, measuring 9 feet 4 inches in length. Height of truss is 19 feet, and width, out to out, 10 feet. Floor beams are 6 by 12 inches, four per panel. Track stringers, double, 5 by 12 inches. Ties, 6 by 8 inches, and 8 inches apart. Guard rail, 6 by 8 inches; new. Lower chord, 4, 6, 4 by 12 inches. End main braces, 8 by 10 inches. Counters, 6 by 6 inches. End tie rods, two, 13-inch diameter. No. 5 is a trestle on pile bents near Palmyra. It is 700 feet long. There are four white oak piles to each bent, which are surmounted by a cap and an 8 by 10-inch corbel, on which rest the 10 by 12-inch track stringers. The bents are 14 feet from center to center, except one near the northern extremity, in which the span is 24 feet between points of support. In this the track stringers are double 6 by 16-inch trussed beams, supported on stone abutments. With the exception of some of the piles which are decayed, thus far through the sap wood only, the structure is in excellent condition. The ties have been double since last year, and a 4 by 6-inch guard rail put on it. Following this, are the &quot;Tom Wood&quot; trestle, 13 spans, of 16 feet each; the &quot;Pritchard&quot; trestle, 10 spans, of 16 feet each; the &quot;Roberts&quot; trestle, 7 spans, of 16 feet each; the &quot;North Mahoning&quot; trestle, 45 spans, 16 feet each; the &quot;Humphrey&quot; trestle, 10 spans, of 16 feet each, and finally, a 10-span trestle near Braceville. All these, except the last, are pile trestles, similar in style of construction, arrangement and dimensions of their several parts, to the work above referred to as No. 5, and situated near Palmyra. In all of them, with the exception of decayed sap wood at the bottom of piles, the timbers are sound. In the &quot;Humphrey&quot; trestle there are only three piles in each bent in- stead of four, as in all the others. All have been overhauled within the year. In the &quot;Pritchard&quot; trestle nearly all the bents are new. Many of the old piles have been cut away, and the floor systems en- tirely renewed. The same is true of the “Roberts,&quot; &quot;North Mahon- ing,&quot; and &quot;Humphrey&quot; trestle, and of a 10-span structure near Braceville. &apos; &quot;COLUMBUS, CHICAGO AND INDIANA CENTRAL RAILWAY. 1041 PERSONS INJURED-CAUSES.

A number of new enterprises have been developed within the year which add to the resources of the line; among these are the opening of extensive stone quarries near Independence, and coal mines near Akron, to which a line has been built. The principal improvements during the year are: Replacing about 20 miles of iron rail, with 56-pound steel, re-laying ties at an average of 500 per mile, and changing side or switching tracks at several sta- tions in such manner as to bring the station buildings between the main line and passing tracks. The work done on bridges and trestles will be specially noted. As far as noted, every instance of want of guard rail, and such like minor deficiencies in structures brought to notice in last year&apos;s inspection, was found to have been corrected. With few exceptions, structures on the line from Cleveland to Canton remain as they were last year. The first important structure, going south from Cleveland, is an iron draw bridge of the Pratt truss pattern, spanning the Cuyahoga river. It is 170 feet long, and supported on a stone masonry center pier, and stone masonry abutments, all of which are protected from injury liable to be caused by floating ice, timber, etc., by rows of piles driven about them at intervals of from 3 to 5 feet. The floor system of this bridge consists of double 12 by 12-inch track stringers, 6 by 8-inch ties, placed 4 inches apart, with 5 by 6-inch wooden guard rail, bolted to them at a distance of 18 inches outside of each rail. All timbers are in excel- lent condition. Some slight alterations in the wall plates have been made recently to facilitate working the bridge. The lower chord con- sists of two 8-inch channel irons, with 24-inch flanges, with one 14 by 16-inch plate at center panels. The floor beams are two, 9-inch I- beams; lower laterals, 14-inch rods. Suspension rods at end panel, two, by 3-inch bars; braces (ties), one, 13-inch rods at end; second panel, two, by 4 inches; third panel, two, by 4-inch bars; fourth panel, two, 1 by 4-inch bars; fifth panel, two, 1 by 4-inch bars; center, two, 23-inch round rods. There are thirteen panels, each 13 feet 6 inches long. Pins, 2 to 3 inches. Posts, two, 11-inch channel irons, laced at center, down to 6-inch channel irons at ends. Depth of truss, 21 feet. Hangers, two, 14-inch rods. Attached to the south end of this bridge, and completing the span of the water way there is a single span trussed beam 30 feet clear span, and 33 feet long, consisting of double 9 by 16-inch track stringers, trussed with three rods, one, 2 inches diameter, and two, 14 inches diameter outside of the track stringers. The truss is 3 feet 7 inches deep from center of rods to center of stringers. The floor system is like that on the draw bridge. Following the above going south are bridges, or rather pile trestles, Nos. 4 and 6, ranging in length from 120 to 60 feet, all of the trussed beam style, except the short span approaches, which are simply track stringers. The trussed spans are 33 feet clear span, and have under each rail three 10 by 16-inch track stringers, trussed with four &quot; &quot;482 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. The number of tons transported in the United States in 1882, was 360,490,375 tons, or nearly 7 tons per capita of the population. In Ohio, the tonnage moved in Ohio alone was 27,239,588, or over 8 tons per capita of population. The net income from the railroads of Ohio upon the capital stock and debt, was 4 72-100 cent.; in the United States, 4 90-100 per cent. The operating expenses in Ohio were 60 71-100 per cent. of the gross earnings; in the United States, 60 78-100 per cent. The comparison might be carried much further into minor details, and be found to express about the same relative per cent. So it may be justly considered that Ohio expresses in the history of her railways the average result of all the United States, and in many of the more important par- ticulars there is a remarkable coincidence of account. &quot; &quot;1450 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

The road-bed is solid, well embanked, and drained, but the right of way not as neatly kept as is the case with some other roads. Fences as a rule, were well kept up, the exception noted being in places where the ravages of recent fires had not been repaired. Ties were heavy; in very good condition, well bedded in ballast, which, as a rule, is gravel, although stone and furnace cinders are found in places. Di- rectly east of Cleveland 25 miles have been ballasted with a gravel bal- last obtained from banks near Painesville, which is of a very peculiar kind. It is a conglomerate of clear, clean gravel stones cemented to- gether, and entirely free from dirt and sand, and possesses, when first laid, all the qualities of washed gravel, or broken stone, in so far as concerns freedom from dust. The rail is sixty and sixty-five pound steel, with angle bar joints and several devices of lock-nut and washers. In bridges and trestles the tendency is to rebuild or renew the former with permanent structures of iron truss and plate girder, or stone arch, and in case of the latter to fill up with solid embankment where prac- ticable. Statistics were shown which proved that this work was carried on at the rate of one mile of trestle per year being filled with earth. The most extensive work of this nature was the renewal and filling with broken stone of the pile trestle through Sandusky Bay, and renewal and filling of a long wooden trestle near Jefferson on the Youngstown branch. This is the only road in, or running through Ohio, which at this date runs its passenger and a portion of its freight trains on the block sys- tem-the only system that, when strictly followed, must absolutely prevent collisions, and which, with the addition of proper interlocking devices, must result in entire security in spite of carelessness or negli- gence on the part of employes. With interlocking machinery careless employes can only cause delay and inconvenience in running trains; without it, even by the block system, the lives of passengers are still to some extent at their mercy. The Youngstown and Oil City branches or divisions of this line are important arteries of trade for the heavy coal and ore. Coal being re- ceived from the coal regions in Mahoning county and further south, and brought to Ashtabula for consumption on the main line and for trans-shipment, while the iron ores received from lake vessels in Ashta- bula harbor are taken down to the iron furnaces and mills in the vicin- ity of Youngtown and further reshipipped to Pittsburgh. The re- ceiving and reshipping docks for coal and ore belonging to the L. S. &amp;amp; M. S. R&apos;y at Ashtabula harbor, together with the machinery to facili- tate handling of freights there, are the most extensive on the lake shore in Ohio at present, but will soon be exceeded in extent by those being built in Toledo by the Ohio Central and by the C. &amp;amp; T. R&apos;y. The transactions of the L. S. &amp;amp; M. S. R&apos;y at Ashtabula during the past year were 300,000 tons of ore received from vessels and shipped south to and via Youngstown, and about 90,000 tons of coal brought back and loaded into vessels. There are on the docks ten traveling revolving &quot; &quot;184 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

No guard rails. The two-span wooden Howe truss deck bridge, over the Tuscarawas river, near Newcomerstown, was, when new, a very strongly built structure. It is now suffering from deterioration and decay. In anti- cipation of the weakening effect of these causes, it has, within the year, been relieved by trestle bent supports near the abutments. The abutments and center pier are of good stone masonry. The approach from the south is a trestle about 1,500 feet long, on a curve of about 3°, and about 24 feet high at its maximum. This was, at date of in- spection, being filled. The bridge contains 14 panels, each 10 feet 2 inches long. Depth of truss, 21 feet; chords, bottom, 4 pieces, 8 by 16 inches, and one outside, 8 by 16 inches through 10 panels; main braces, from 9 by 14 inches to 7 by 10 inches; counters, 7 by 10 inches; tie rods, from ends, three, 23 inches diameter to three, 1 inch diame- ter in center; floor beams, 7 by 15 inches, two feet from center to center; stringers, 8 by 12 inches, resting on 12-inch face; ties, 6 by 8 inches, 6 inches apart; guard rail, 6 by 8 inches. The trestle and shorter span trussed beam structures have, within the year, been overhauled, some completely, and others only in part. The worst defects of these, which were brought to notice last year, have, in the main, been cured, temporarily. In the trestle over the canal at Newcomerstown piles are new and sound, stringers decayed outwardly, but still strong, but ties very rot- ten, and bunched in many places. No guard rails. The Heister trestle, between Dover and Newcomerstown has been overhauled, but is still without guard rails. A structure just south of above, is apparently being prepared to be filled. The Big Johnson trestle, a short distance south of the Tuscarawas river bridge, has been almost entirely renewed. It has now ties from 4 to 5 inches apart, and good guard rails. 66 The Little Johnson trestle is being filled up. Between Kumbolton and Cambridge a number of the old truss bridges over Wills creek are being strengthened by reduction spans, which is effected by putting pile bent supports under the first or second panel point from each end, and also by the introduction of strong double iron truss rods or hog chains&quot; on the lower chord. This has been accomplished, with but few exceptions, on all the old wooden bridges on Wills creek, and is also being done to those over Duck creek. The expenditures caused by these improvements, and by work done on ballast, track, roadway, ditches, and ties, since date of last inspection, have been very great, and yet only a close inspection and a comparison of the present con- dition of the road with that of one year ago, shows that anything has been done at all-to such a low general condition had the road been permitted to fall before real earnest work looking to its improvement was begun.

From Jeffersonville to Allentown fully half the ties are of standard length, the remainder are short, such as a narrow gauge uses. West of Allentown only about one-seventh of the ties are of proper length. The track is in bad condition every way; and there is no fencing to speak of. The ditches along the western half of the road are in better condition. I saw one set of hands at work. There are 2,640 ties to a mile. A small trestle 6 feet high and 36 feet long. The trestle over Rattlesnake has 12 pile bents, of timber like that at Jeffersonville, is good and strong, and about 12 feet above water. A short distance beyond is a small trestle of three lengths and 6 or 7 feet high, of similar construction, and near Bowersville another of the same size and build. Trestle 72 feet; 12 feet high over rivulet; 4 longitudinal pieces bolted to the bents. Timber 10 by 12 inches, put up like the others. New bridge or trestle, 180 feet long, 12 feet above water. The bents are framed of 10 by 12 inch oak timber; there are two vertical and two bat- ter posts in each bent, and double cross-braced stringers 12 by 16 inches, over four 12-foot spaces, and double stringers over one 20-foot space. There are three double frame piers, and 2 45-foot trussed girders. These girders have 3 stringers 6 by 14 inches, and 2 rods on each side 24 inches diameter. The rods dip 5 feet, and sustain two props which di- vide the girder into 3 equal spaces of 15 feet each. A small approach is on the west side. Flooring 5 by 8 inches, 12 inches apart.

Here is a long, high, new trestle work, total length about 600 feet, in the highest place 36 feet over water. The bents are 16 feet apart. At the east end are 2 one-story, and 4 two-story frame bents; then fol- low 4 stone piers (built up above high water mark), on which the bents are placed, for the 3 30-foot trussed girders; beyond these stand 7 two- story bents, and 18 single story, all of foot-square timber.

A standard gauge road, under excellent management, and in good Road-bed. general repair. The road-bed is well drained, and banked up. Ballast, gravel, worn and thin in some places, especially toward Canton, but is now receiving attention. A few miles north of Akron, and also near Peninsula Station, the road curves around steep side-hill slopes, which are likely to cause inconvenience by continual washing and con- sequent filling of drain ditches, if they are not also a source of dan- ger from land slides. Ties are in fair condition, only a small proportion being unservice- able. The track is a heavy rail, in good preservation, fair surface, but not generally well aligned, there being many short lateral bends or kinks in the rails. Since last year an extension of the road for a distance of 18 miles from Canton to Valley Junction, where it connects with the Wheeling and Lake Erie system, has been opened. This extension appears to be better built than the main line. The embankments are good and trestles and bridges strong and well constructed. The terminal facilities of the road in Cleveland are excellent in situ- ation but somewhat crowded and narrow, and somewhat inconvenient as regards transfer to other roads. The passenger landing is at the foot of Water street, in a situation affording nearly the same facilities of access to, and exit from, that are found at the N. Y., P. &amp;amp; O. station, which almost adjoins this. The river front, belonging to the road, does not appear to be fully developed, and the side switching and yard facilities at the immediate terminus are very limited, and must be in- adequate for the requirements of the road.

In this report mention is made, whereever infor- mation on the subject was obtainable, of matters other than the condition of roadbed and structures, such as repair shops, terminal and yard facilities, and like matter calculated to aid in forming a correct judgment of the generai and comparative standing, and busine s capacity of a railroad. • Acknowledgments are due to all the railroads mentioned in this report, for co-operation and assistance in making the inspection. 26 Very respectfully, GEORGE RUHLEN &quot; &quot;CINCINNATI, HOCKING VALLEY AND HUNTINGTON RAILWAY. 799 COST OF ROAD EQUIPMENT, ETC.

Toussaint and Packer creeks iron girders. Toledo, Mau- mee river, Pratt truss. Short spans, west of To- ledo. Edgerton, Pratt truss. There are also three spans of Howe truss bridges east of the above, 120, 130, and 140 feet in length. Over Huron river, at Huron, there is a single track low wooden Howe truss draw bridge, 136 feet long, which was rebuilt in 1878. Through Sandusky Bay the track passes over a pile trestle bridge, which, with the iron draw bridge and the intervals of broken stone filling, is 7,500 feet long. This is now being substantially rebuilt, and bents partly filled with stone. The iron draw spoken of above is a Post truss, built in 1872. It rests on a stone center pier with pile foundations. The wooden Howe truss draw bridge at Port Clinton, 170 feet long, rests on pile abutments, with stone center pier resting on pile founda- tions. Depth of truss, 10 feet at ends, and 24 feet in center. It con- tains 18 panels of unequal lengths, and has an arched or curved upper chord, also an outer wooden and inner railroad iron guard rail. Floor beams, 7 by 14 inches, 2 feet apart, suspended from lower chord. The upper laterals extend across the three center panels only, the trusses being too low at the ends to admit of upper lateral bracing there. Lower chord, 5, 6, 6, 5 by 12 inches. Track stringers, 10 by 12 inches. Main braces from 8 by 12 to 84 by 9 inches. Tie rods in sets of two, from 1 to 18 inches diameter. The lower chords of this bridge have been renewed within two years. At Toussaint creek and Packer creek are at the former two, and at the latter one span iron girders, 40 feet long, which were built in 1880. At Toledo, over the Maumee, is a magnificent iron three-span Pratt truss bridge, each span being 167 feet long, and also one-span draw- bridge, 190 feet long, all supported on stone masonry piers resting on pile foundation; all built in 1877. From Toledo westward there are a number of short span iron girders, and one two-span deck iron Pratt truss bridge over the St. Joseph river at Edgerton. The latter is a new, strongly built structure, resting on good stone masonry abutments at center pier. Length of span, c. to c. of end pins, 79 feet 11 inches. Depth of truss, 8 feet 6 inches. Length of panels, 11 feet 5 inches; seven panels.

These are used under all wooden bridges, and iron ones where they are suitable. This road prefers to have some wood bearing at bridge seats; apparently for two reasons. First, to give a degree of elasticity at the seat that would not be required by planting directly on stone; and second, to supply a slightly yielding material, so that a good bear- ing will be got between the surfaces, such as will not permit of slip- ping or creeping. Some fine iron culverts of 10 feet span or less, com- posed of I-beams, stayed with cast iron packing and lateral tie rods, have wall plates of the above blocks. Another standard is bridge flooring, consisting about as follows: Ties, 6 by 8 inches, lying flat, placed 8 inches between, and 9 feet long; wooden guard rail, 6 by 8 inches, lying flat, spliced, thus, and beveled Joints. Grades. 8 OR 10&apos; X about 1 inches on both the upper corners; placed about 15 inches out- side the rails, and bolted every second to fourth tie. The distance out, however, varies from 12 to 20 inches in extreme cases, and the splice sketched has the joint and key sometimes horizontal, and the bolts vertical, instead of the contrary, as first adopted. The latter appears decidedly preferable. Iron guard rails between the track rails, so much fancied by some, are not used on the B. and O. R. R. in Ohio, except on bridges of the Columbus and Newark division, and the Shawnee branch, where they are placed about 8 inches inside the track rails over the entire bridge, and to about 100 to 150 feet out upon the bank approaches, and over trestling or other bridge-like structures in the bridge approaches. The Road-master is not in favor of iron guard rails, because it has serious objections, which he judges will outweigh the advantages. For instance, he says that the weight, as additional dead load upon the bridge, is objectionable; also it is seriously in the way in repairing the flooring. He holds that no help is afforded by the guard rail to trucks with a broken axle, though for simple derailment it is admitted that the iron guard rail is advantageous. Mr. Lee prefers to put the value of the iron guard rail into a better track, and thus to increase the safety. Also, ties for track, the standard number is stated to be 3,000 to the mile; all good. Rails, 60 pounds to the yard; steel. Fastenings mostly angle bar. Have few of Samson&apos;s. Near stations, where speed is slow, as was seen at Zanesville, at Somerset on the Shawnee branch, and north of Chicago Junction, a few of the old Trimble joint fasten- ings are still in use. Between Newark and Bellaire the maximum grade is stated to be 85 feet to the mile. Maximum degree of curves, about 6 degrees. Ele- vation of outer rail on curves, 4 inches per degree to 3 degrees.

For two or three miles, near Webster, the track is as bad as possible, worn-out iron, old-fashioned chairs, no alignment and no surfacing.

Changes have been made within the year by increasing the number and size of the ties on some of these trestles, and also in completing many un- finished works by the addition of lateral and longitudinal bracing. The trestle near Union Furnace, which is about 26 feet high and 880 feet long, has, in addition to the outer wooden guard rail, an inner one of railroad iron at its north end, inside of the curve. There are two tunnels on this line; one near Eagle Furnace, 275 feet long, and one near Campbell, 875 feet long; both have natural rock roofs, and are 15 feet wide in the clear. XIV. MACOMB, DESHLER AND TOLEDO RAILROAD. Inspected Au- gust 21. A small branch line extending from Deshler, where the B. &amp;amp; O. crosses the C. H. &amp;amp; D., to McComb, now a station on the N. Y. C. &amp;amp; St. L. It was built about three years ago as a private enterprise, to give an outlet to an extensive trade in staves and lumber. It is now in the hands of the C. H. &amp;amp; D. Co. The line is 9 miles long, runs through a flat country, and almost entirely through forests. There are no open bridges, the only structures being a few low two and three span tres- tles, so short that ordinarily they would not be observed by a person going over the road. Track is in fair order, ties new, ballast very light and occasionally entirely wanting. The branch has lost some of its importance since the construction of the N. Y. C. &amp;amp; St. L. road, which now supplies in another direction the wants of the community for which this road was built. XV. CLEVELAND, DELPHOS AND ST.

Bridge No. 24. Prat truss. Bridge No. 15 has also been replaced by a new lattice girder; put up in summer of 1882. Crossing Mad river, at Springfield, is a two-span Howe truss deck bridge; spans being 142 and 98 feet long, respectively. It was built in 1873, and is in good state of preservation. In the long span the lower chords are 6, 7, 7, 6 by 13 inches. End main braces, double, 11 by 9 inches. Counters, in center panel, 10 by 8 inches, and tie rods from 2, 13 inches diameter in center to 3, 2 inches in diameter at ends. The entire floor system as in other bridges on this road. On mile further on, towards Dayton, there is another two-span Howe truss bridge, in arrangement and dimension of parts like that just de- scribed. It also crosses Mad river. The old bridge No. 21, over Mud Run, near Osborn, has been re-, placed by the cut-down part of an iron 70-foot span bridge brought from another part of the road. The remainder of this road, from Dayton to Cincinnati, was assigned to another member of the commission for inspection, and will be re- ported on by him. I may state here, however, that since inspected last summer the fol- lowing improvements made on the road south of Dayton were brought to my attention on passing over the road, viz. : Bridge No. 24, 14 miles below Dayton. Two new spans, iron Pratt truss, made by Kellogg &amp;amp; Maurice, each span 150 feet long, have been completed, and take the place of wooden Howe truss spans of same length. The floor beams in these structures are riveted to posts, as is usual with bridges manufactured by this firm; the end beams are iron I-beams, proportioned to carry about one-half the load of the main track stringers. Ties are 6 by 8 inches, spaced 4 inches apart, and are 12 feet long. There are also two iron guard rails, 7 inches from tracks inside, and 6 by 8-inch wooden guard rails outside. There is a clear head room 19 feet above top surface of rail, and clear width of 14 feet between trusses. The old Howe truss bridge at this place contained four spans. Two of the iron spans are completed, as above described, a third is in progress, and the fourth will be in place by March 1, 1883. Total length of spans is 151 feet, height out to out, 25 feet, dead weight, including roadway, 1520 pounds per lineal foot. Expansion rollers on one end and bridge seats of both trusses rest on one stone. The pedestal stone is 20 inches thick. In its entirity of abutments, piers, su- perstructure and approaches this is a most magnificent specimen of bridge construction. At Hold&apos;s Crossing there is also a new, recently completed iron Pratt truss built by the Keystone Co., of Pittsburg. It is 106 feet long, 21 feet high, center to center of pins. It has iron track and side string- ers like the above. The suspension hangers are eye bars. The top of abutments consists of two courses of Berea stone, 26 inches, and 32 inches thick bonded together. Ties are 6 by 8 inches on thin 6-inch edges, 4 inches apart, and 12 feet long. &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 397 and with both pin bearings.

There is on this line of road only one truss bridge. It is a wooden, modified Bollman truss of 50 feet span, crossing the Chagrin river. It rests on stone masonry abutments. Its timbers are in good condition. One truss, which, owing to defective adjustment, probably, was sprung a few inches out of line, has been adjusted, and the whole bridge strengthened by the addition of two iron bars, so applied as to add materially to the strength of the entire structure. Bollman truss bridge. Near Chagrin Falls is a well built two-arch stone masonry viaduct, Chagrin Falls, over a public highway. All other structures are wooden trestles, of a uniform style of con- struction, bents being 12 feet from centers, framed, with sill, two ver- tical and two batter posts, surmounted by a cap, and a single 12 by 14 inch track stringer under each rail. The substitute for ties on trestles and bridges on the entire road was a 2 by 6 inch board, fastened to the track stringers, if fastened at all, by the iron spike which holds the rail in place. These ties were generally loose and warped out of shape, and in many places two feet apart. There was not a vestige of a guard rail on any part of the road at date of last year&apos;s inspection. The longest of the above trestles is now being filled, the work being now half completed. A number of the short ones have already been filled, several defective cattle guards repaired, and new and stronger ties put on remaining trestles, which latter are also being provided with guard rails. The work done during the year has been in the in- terests of safety and comfort to passengers, as well as that of the road. In addition to the new ties laid on trestles, some have been placed on the road at other points, and ten tons of new steel rails have also been put down, in place of some of the worn out iron rails. The passenger equipment is very defective, being only a very old and rickety caboose. The rolling stock consists, aside from this, of one eighteen-ton locomo- tive and seven freight cars. I am informed by the managers that nego- tiations are in progress for the purchase of a new passenger car. Al- though apparently but a small enterprise, it seems to supply a very important need to the thrifty community for whose convenience it was built. The road is only partially fenced. It is now being ballasted with gravel and sand, hauled by means of wagons from the bed of the Chagrin river, and distributed by train along the road. stone arch.

There are no inside guard rails, either on this bridge or any other, so far as the road has been exam- ined. Means of safety being thus wanting, in case a loaded car, or locomotive should be derailed on the bridge, disaster is certain to follow. Eight of the cast iron chord blocks, against which the braces abut, are crushed, and, of course, thereby still further weaken the originally weak structure. The bridges This bridge Two road beams and several ties are badly decayed. on this road are not covered, and are 6 or 7 years old. sinks under a locomotive to the extent of two inches, as well as I could judge by the eye, and sways laterally far too much for a safe bridge. For the dimensions of the separate parts, reference is made to the book of plans and descriptions herewith submitted. The track stringers are double, and are of pine, 5 by 10 inches, and resting on road beams which are too far apart, especially when the beams are 14 feet between supports. Over the canal at Lockbourne; length, 100 feet; width, 14 feet; height, 214 feet; measured in the usual way; similar to No. 5, except the timbers are smaller. It is reached by trestle work on each side; the north trestle being 180 feet, and the south 150 feet long, and all are embraced in a curve of a radius of 1,500 or 2,000 feet. The rails of the curve are not regularly bent, some of them are nearly straight, and others bent to a radius much smaller than those above given, wherefore it was difficult or impossible to find out by measurement what the intended radius is. The ribbons are loose in many places, and rotten in others. They would offer no appreciable resistance in case of derailment of a train. A passenger train crossed while I was on the bridge. It bent down- ward, and swayed laterally as if ready to fall on a little more provoca- tion. The trestle at the south end behaved similarly, although not to so great an extent. The bridge timbers are the smallest which I have found anywhere. The ties on trestles and bridges should not leave open spaces over three inches wide, or four at the greatest; but here they are twelve, and consequently would be broken or knocked entirely out of place at the first shock of a loaded car or locomotive. Besides, several of them are much decayed, so as to offer only a slight resistance against the spreading of the track under a locomotive. Two or three of them I picked nearly asunder in a couple of minutes. Near Ashville; two spans, each 100 feet; of the usual width and height-and weakness. The end posts are only 6 inches square, and being pine, and 20 feet long, they would serve better for bean poles than for bridge posts. There are two broken castings in the north span.

The latter frames are made by nailing four slats of about 2 by 4 inches, sharpened on one edge, to short bits of plank 1 by 6 inches, and about 2 feet length, and so nailed that the sharpened edges are upward. The frame between the rails has 5 slats. The 1 by 6-inch plank pieces are placed so near the ends of the slats, that they lie very near the 4 by 12-inch sticks when in position, and thus the slat racks do not slide out of place. To examine or repair a guard, the slat racks are easily lifted. This guard appears to be a very simple, inexpensive and good one. In some cases the timbers are lighter, say 10 by 12 inches, and the slat- racks may in some cases be left out. This road appears to be in very good running condition. The struc- tures being nearly new, are sound and strong. Many of the structures are heavier in proportion for the narrow gauge rolling stock, than found on many full gauge tracks. For instance, trestle timbers are in some cases 12 by 12 inches, for posts which are usually of that size under full gauge track. One fact to be regretted as a future consideration, is the absence of covering for bridges, on account of which comparatively early renew- als will be necessitated. The station buildings at Bellaire and Woodsfield are combined wait- ing and freight houses. The traffic here is local, and hence no special or elaborate terminal freight handling facilities.

The showing for 1882, compared with this average for 15 years, is quite un- favorable. In 1882, one person was injured every ten hours, and one killed every 26 hours. However, the increase is among the employes and &quot;others&quot;— the passenger casualties perceptibly decreasing; since, during 1882, only 5 per cent. of the injuries, and 1 per cent. of the fatalities, were to passengers.

Trestles. Alum creek and Black Lick, Howe. Trestle. Trestle. times partly buried in the earth, but is usually on or even slightly raised above the surface. This is surmounted by a cap, which supports directly the single, 12 by 14-inch, or double, 6 by 14-inch track stringers. These bents are 14 feet from centers. The ties are 6 by 8 inches, and from 16 to 20 inches apart from center to center, with a 4 by 6 or 6 by 6-inch wooden guard rail, bolted to alternate ties. The bent timbers are uniformly 12 inches square in cross section. In some of the long trestles a system of lateral bracing is being intro- duced, which consists of two 6 by 6-inch timbers, crossing each other diagonally, and reaching from bent to bent, being similar in applica- tion to the lateral braces of the ordinary Howe truss bridges. The road master states that he has found these very effective in keeping the track in perfect alignment, where other methods of lateral bracing have proved inefficient. The longest trestles on the road are the pile trestle at Toledo, already mentioned, the approaches to the bridges at McCutchenville, Bucyrus, Mt. Gilead, Lincoln Centre, the trestles near Baltimore, Basil, Sycamore, Georges creek, and Black Lick. The Howe truss bridges over Alum creek and Black Lick, which are not as well built as like structures on newer parts of the road, appear to have proved inadequate for the service required of them, and were overhauled, and substantially strengthened in the parts found defici- ent, since last year. A trestle, between Hebron and Granville, is being filled, and another near Granville replaced by a 70-foot span truss bridge. In some of the long trestles, especially on the line from Columbus to Bush&apos;s or Hadley Junction, much annoyance and inconvenience is caused by the creeping of rails, and consequent movement of the top of the structure in the same direction. In several instances this has been corrected by moving back the foot of the bent, thus bringing them to a vertical position without interference with the lateral brac- ing at the top. Where, as the case in some instances, the bottom sill of the framed bent rests on piles, this course is, of course, impractica- ble, and the work of rectifying the inclination due to creeping is very great. Corning Branch. From Hadley Junction to Corning-using the line of the C. &amp;amp; M. V. R&apos;y, from Bremen to New Lexington. There are no open truss bridges on this line between Hadley and Corning. The recently built exten- sion beyond Corning was not examined. The ballast on line between Lexington and the first tunnel is light; beyond the tunnel, slag from the furnaces in the vicinity is being put in. Iron rail, now on the line, is being replaced with 56-pound steel. From Lexington to Corning the road is fenced with barbed wire. The first work of importance, going south from Hadley, is a 10-span trestle, near Rushville. The spaces are 15 feet from center to center of supports, which are pile bents. Stringers, double, 7 by 14 inches. &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 149 XI. CINCINNATI AND EASTERN RAILROAD, AND COLUMBUS AND MAYSVILLE RAILWAY. 1. C. &amp;amp; E. Walnut Hills Branch. Near the junction, at Idlewild, is a high trestle on a curve-say 45 feet at the highest point. There are 16 bents, of which 6 are double- story, 18 feet apart. The stringers are oak, double, 6 by 16 inches; ties, 5 by 7 inches, notched, and 9 or 10 inches apart. Guard rails, 6 by 6 inches. Along the upper story are four longitu linal girders for bracing; and additional four also along the two-story part. The cross- bracing is 2 by 12 inches, well bolted; corbels 4 feet long, 10 by 10 inches; posts all 8 by 10 inches; caps, 8 feet, 10 by 10 inches. The track to Batavia Junction is pretty rough, as is natural in a new road, but it is in process of continual improvement. Seven or eight trestles of from three to five bents each, have been filled, leaving in two or three instanees a cattle pass. Two have been renewed, and all have been overhauled and improved. Remarks.

There is one span of 22 feet, where the double stringers are 9 by 16 inches. In 1882 a bent was placed under this for strengthening it. The floor is 5 by 7 inches, at 9 inches interval. The frame is of 6 by 8 inch timber, and conse- quently very light. The corbels are 5 feet, the caps of 9-inch timber; these are long sloping transverse braces of small dimensions. The ribbons are 5 by 7 inches, and are notched. 1 Summary of Finances and Business. Cincinnati and Eastern Railway: Mileage, owned. 66 leased.. 80.4 19 Total...

The length of the line in operation is thirty miles. The road runs through an almost dead level country, and there are nowhere embankments or cuts exceeding eight feet vertical measure- ment. The rail is light, with fish plate joints, secured by four bolts. Ties are at the rate of about 2,200 per mile, but very light, being mostly hewn, and having, in many cases, a bearing surface for track not more than 4 inches wide. The majority are ash, some oak is found, also a few other kinds of wood. There is as yet no ballast on any part of the line. Much of the road is through forests. The road-bed is, to a great extent, overgrown with weeds, so that in many places the rails cannot be seen. There is a strong, well-built combination truss bridge over a branch of the Auglaize river near Delphos. The track for a distance of a hun- dred yards on each side of this bridge is in better surface than on the line, and a slight attempt at ballasting has been made. Combination truss bridge, near Delphos. Queen post truss bridge, near Vaughn- ville. Over Hog creek, near Vaughnville, is a Queen post truss bridge, 40 feet span, on framed bent supports, with a short trestle span at each end. Timbers sound and all new. At Rymer there is a six-span Queen post truss bridge, with stone Rymer, shore abutments and one stone center pier. The intermediate sup- ports are trestle bents. These are, no doubt, temporary, the ultimate intention being to make the structure a two-span open truss bridge. At Pendleton, between Columbus Grove and Bluffton, there is an- other Queen post truss bridge, containing three spans, supported on double-framed trestle bents. Dimensions of timbers as in other cases, viz.: Double 6 by 12 inch stringers, 6 by 8 inch ties, 6 inches apart, with 12 by 12 inch timbers for end braces, and horizontal upper and lower beams or chords, held at articulations by two 1-inch iron rods. The above are the principal important structures, and are all strong, well built, though, in some instances, on insecure foundations, this being probably a temporary fault, due to haste in the work of construc- tion. The road, in its present condition, is barely fit for construction trains, yet scheduled passenger trains run daily from Delphos to Bluff- ton. There are as yet no station-houses on the line, and no fences. There are telegraph stations at Delphos, Columbus Grove and Bluff- ton. Queen post truss bridge.

No. 142, girder bridge. No. 149, girder bridge. No. 152. One side of this bridge has been broken by a derailed train since last year&apos;s tour. After the break, which destroyed the lower chord and several braces on one side, 5 trestle bents were put under to tempora- rily carry the roadway. Bents made of 12 by 12 inch timbers, with 2 plumb and two batter posts. Though the structure at present looks bad, yet it is strong and safe. No. 129, a stringer bridge of two spans, of 11 by 12 feet; three stringers, 6, 7, and 7 by 16 inches for the short span, and with two, 6 by 16, and one, 10 by 12 inches for long span, under each rail. Two stringers continuous over middle pier. The abutments and pier of uncut, small stone, laid apparently in lime mortar. The joint material between stone failing, and abutments falling. Provisional trestle bents are placed near the failing abutments and pier for security. Stringers extend over nearly 10 feet upon banks, and planted on blocks or sills. Ties are 6 by 8 inches, and 20 inches c. to c. Ribbons, or guards, 4 by 6 inches, notched and spiked. Rail to water, 15 feet. Structure believed to be safe. Along here to No. 141 are several small openings, some new, one a new 2-span trestle, 30 feet long and 10 feet high; another a new 10-foot culvert; another a girder bridge of short spans; then two stone arch culverts; then a new girder bridge. No. 141, a girder bridge of about 13 feet span, and 14 feet above bed of stream. Abutments are trestles, plumb posts, 10 by 12 inches, and batters, 8 by 12 inches; the south end fair. North end has two bents, one to aid the other, and both in doubtful condition for perfect safety. Stringers, three, 7 by 16 inches, running well over upon the banks; whole length, 36 feet. Ties, originally split sticks, and laid at 18 inches c. to c., without tie laths or ribbons. Since last year, railroad truck ties have been added, one between each two of the split ties, and stayed apart by 1 by 5 inch pieces of board, nailed on strings between the ties. One old cap bad, but will be repaired soon. No. 142, girder bridge of two 12-foot spans, and about 11 feet height above stream. Stringers, one, 6 by 16, and one, 7 by 16 inch pine, under each rail, extend over 12 feet on banks. The undressed small stone abutment walls falling. Stringer supported on trestle bents, and walls left only to hold the banks up. Ties, 6 in 10 feet, irregular spac- ing, 14 to 30 inches.

West approach same as the east, 40 feet high; there are two bars on each side of the girder bridge, 3 inches deep by § inch thick, dropping 5 feet. The piers for the pony Howe Truss stand on piles; the frames are of 12-inch square timber, and are 50 feet high, but are very securely braced, as is made necessary by danger from ice. The truss is 71 feet long, of 10 panels of 6 feet each. The track-stringers are double, and 10 by 18 inches. The floor beams are 8 by 16 inches, the ties 6 by 8 inches, and at 6 inches intervals. Ribbons, same size as ties and well bolted. The lower chord has three pieces, 6 by 14 inches; the upper, same, except the depth is 12 inches. The main braces run from 8 by 10 to 10 by 10 inches; the counters are 6 by 6 inches; rods are double, and vary from 1 to 13 inches. The total length of the bridge and the approaches is 200 feet.

The present condition is good. A few old ones are seen, but none which are bad, The poorest will hold a spike well. On the Shawnec Branch the wood for ties is white oak. Dimensions, duration, number per mile, about the same as on other divisions. The number laid since last year, 21,000. The condition of the ties in the track good. For the Central Ohio Division the former iron rail weighed 64 pounds per yard, but it is now found only in the sidings, which are often quite defective, by breaks in the bed, and uneven surface. All the main line track here is 60 pound steel, and has been for over a year. No new steel laid during the past year on this division. The joints are secured by the angle-bar, 4 bolts, and the Varona lock nut. Have had no trouble from the crushing of rails. On the Columbus and Newark Division the rail notes are the same as for the Central Ohio Division, except here there are a very few &amp;quot;fish-plate&amp;quot; joints. The steel is all Edgar Thompson, and Cambria, about equal parts, to test the comparative merits. For the Lake Erie Division, the rails south of Chicago Junction are all steel, and also north for 3 miles. Since last visit the steel rail lay- ing, etc., of Chicago Junction has been completed, and the three miles north have been laid. The joints are secured for the steel by the angle-bar, while for the iron between the three miles at Chicago Junc- tion and Sandusky is mostly secured by the Trimble joint. The sides of this rail are not adapted for the fish-plate nor angle-bar, the head being of the form known as the &amp;quot;pear shaped,&amp;quot; and the section as in No. 2 of page 396 of last year&apos;s report. West of Chicago Junction, on the Chicago Division, as far as the State line, the rails are all steel, in the main line, of the standard weight, 60 pounds. No iron rails laid during past year except in sid- ings, and in the main line 70 miles of steel, completing the main line in steel to State limit. Joints secured by the angle-bar, etc., as seems to be standard, viz., angle-bar, 4 bolts, and the Varona lock. Also, the joints are the suspension joints, and those on one rail line alter- nate with those on the opposite rail line, even on curves. The alter- nating joints are rigidly adhered to, rails of different lengths being employed to secure alternation at curves. The rails are all good here. Oldest on division, 4 years. No serious &amp;quot;low joints.&amp;quot; One run of 13 miles in 13 minutes made into Fostoria. On the Shawnee branch the rails are all iron, 64 lbs., except nine miles of 64 lb. steel, laid during the past year, it being second-band rails from the lines in Virginia. The ends of this rail are slightly worn or battered from previous use; and, though the joints are now kept well to line and close, yet the wheel gives a click at the instant of transition over the rail joint. The steel joints are secured by the standard above mentioned. The iron is mostly secured by the Trim- ble joint fastening. Same fish-plate joints are in use on the iron. &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. No. 23. 1½ inches. Floor-beams, 7 and 8 by 14 inches; 5 to the panel.

During the past year one new stringer has been added throughout, one new bent, a new cap, and all in good condition. The three middle and tallest bents are peculiar in construction. Each of these bents stand on eight pile heads. The pile heads are placed in two rows of four each, crosswise, and 4 or 6 feet apart. Four 12 by 12-inch blocks, about 6 feet long, parallel to track, are placed by pairs on the pile heads. On these, crosswise the track, are placed two 12 by 12-inch sticks reaching over all. On these are placed two small framed trestles of 12 by 12 inch sticks, and 6 feet high, with the planes of the bents parallel to the track. These are braced sidewise from the long cross-sticks.

The engines are stated to be moguls, length, bumper to pilot, 41 feet. Ballast mostly of excellent materials, about half of it is broken Ballast. stone. In many places the quantity of ballast is meagre, it being crowned or convex, and at the highest point at mid-gauge it sometimes rises but little over the mid-height of ties. But the ballast appears to hold the track, though the latter is badly out of correct line in many places. It appears, however, not to be so much the fault of ballast as of the embankments, which, at some half dozen places, make trouble by slipping. The stone ballast is both sandstone and limestone. Embank- ments. Rails. The rails measure 30 feet in length, for a common length, and laid with alternating joints. Ties are usually 15 to the rail length, though occasionally 14 only. The rails are mostly 35 pounds per yard, though 40 pounds are now put in when any new ones are added. Four miles of the 40-pound rail are now down at points of heavy grade. Rails are iron and full spiked. No new rail laid since last year. The fish plate fastening with four bolts are used. No trouble from creeping of rails. The stated number of ties per mile is 2,640. White oak, 6 feet long, Ties. some of them from Virginia. Width, 7 to 12 inches. Number laid during year, 2,000. Average cost, 30 cents. The maximum grades are 130 feet per mile, the road running through Grades. very hilly country. At points the line appears to rise to the heights of elevated ground, beautiful distant views and fine scenery being pre- sented. The road appears to be mostly serviceable to the farming in- terests along the region. The country appears like an old and long settled one. The wealthy farmers along the line contributed largely to the building of the road. Ditches average about 6 inches below bottom of ties, but they are not kept regular at this figure. At a few points the ditches were seen filled by the action of the water. Ditches. The right of way averages about 35 feet. At some cuts and fills it is Right of way. more.

Banks terminate against planking, held by the abutment trestles. Trestle bents have two plumb and two batter posts, cap and sill, all 12 by 12 inches. Sway braces on bents, 3 by 8 inches. Bents each stand on four 12 by 12 blocks. The bent-caps connected by lateral bracing, without chords, that is, between each two caps braces are put in X fashion. Strings, 7 by 16 inches. Ties, 7 by 8 inches and 10 feet long. Guards, 7 by 8 inches. The parts being filled have yet the old ties, very poor. Height above water, 174 feet. No. 12, a trestle, 90 feet long, and 6 spans, two, 7 by 16 inches. String bents like those in No. 11. Ties, 8 by 8 inches by 10 feet long, 5 inches between. Guards, 7 by 8 inches. No end bearers. Banks end against planks. Height, 22 feet. No. 13, a through Howe uncovered truss bridge of two spans, one track with continuous chords; each span, 104 feet. Ten panels. Depth of truss, 23 feet. Usual width. Twenty-five feet, rail to bot- tom. Structure, old; crosses the Sandusky river, at Tiffin. Lower chords, 5, 6, 6, 5 by 14 inches. Clamps, 14 inches at the necks, with long parallel heads. Two clamps to the joint for the two inside pieces of the chord. Braces, 9 by 104 inches. End truss rods, three, 1 inches. Next three, 1 inches. Floor-beams, 7 by 16 inches, 4 to the panel. Laterals, 6 by 6 inches, and 14-inch rods top and bottom. Stringers, two, 6 by 12 inches, boxed. Ties, 7 by 8 inches. Guard rails, 7 by 8 inches, bolted and spliced. The sap-wood of the posts of this bridge is badly rotted, and gives a very bad appearance to the bridge. The section of the lower chords is estimated to be reduced by the sap rot from the original 14 inches depth, to 10 or 12 inches of effective wood, or a reduction of section of 12 to 25 per cent. By sounding the timbers with a boring bit, all ex- amined were found sound at the heart. Made three borings at differ- ent points in the structure. The splice-joints of the lower chord were holding well, indicating absence of dry or other rot at the heart. The splices were carefully examined, and no joint could be found which gave any signs of failing. The absolute safety of this bridge is regarded as doubtful. The nature of the stream beneath is not favorable for permanent trestle supports. An early renewal of the bridge is believed desirable, though the comparatively light engines and traffic of the road is favorable; also the slow speed here near the station. The abutments and middle pier are of double framed trestle work. The general plan of the tres- tle work is that of two bents, 3 or 4 feet apart, framed and braced be- tween. The middle pier is surrounded with a rack of timber, filled in with stone to anchor it. Foundations, bed-rock. The south approach is a trestling over streets, 121 feet long. Re- paired a year ago. &quot; &apos;COMPARISON OF THE RAILROADS OF OHIO AND OF THE UNITED STATES. The census returns of the General Government for 1880 afford for the first time a general report concerning the railroads of the United States. In many particulars this report is in parallel with the reports of the Ohio railroads, and consequently affords points of interest in comparison, one with the other. The peculiar physical position of Ohio, and its close relation to the progress of civilization from the Eastern to the more Western States, has caused it to be termed the &quot;Mediterranean State&quot; of the Union. The great flow of the overland commerce of the nation has been through Ohio. The great trunk lines of the railroads of the East extend themselves through this State into a multitude of branches, reaching any point of the Great West. This midway relation is strongly marked in the statistics of the railroads of the State, compared with the census report of all the States. The number of miles of railway in Ohio in 1880 was 5,654.82; in all the States for the same time, 86,781.47, 100 per cent. being Ohio roads. The average capital stock per mile of Ohio roads was $31,375.00. The average of the United States, $30,117.00, a difference of only 4 per cent. The average debt per mile in Ohio, $33,489.00; in the United States, $32,405.00. The stock and debt in the first, $64,864.00; in the latter, $62,522; an excess in the former of 3 per cent. The average cost of road and equipment, per mile, was $55,255.00 in Ohio; in the United States it was $52,205.00, an excess in the former of 5.8 per cent. The excess expressed in per cent. in the foregoing particulars is from 3 to 5.8 per cent. But the results in the use of the capital is more favorable to the Ohio roads. In this State the average gross earnings per mile were $7,309.00; in the United States, $6,688.00; in favor of the former, over 9 per cent. The operating ex- penses upon Ohio roads averaged $4,368.00 per mile, while those of the General Gov- ernment averaged $4,065.00; and the average net earnings per mile in the former were $2,941.00; in the latter, $2,625.00, 12 per cent. in favor of Ohio. The passenger earnings of Ohio roads per mile were $1,616.00; the freight earnings $5,282.00; while those of the United States for passengers were $1,662.00, and for freight $4,795.00. The average receipts for carrying mail in this State were $160.00 per mile of railroad, and in all the States, $120.00 per mile. The average cost for passenger travel in Ohio, 2 37-100 cents per mile; and in all the States, 2 33-100 cents. There will be found quite a disparity in the average re- ceipts per ton per mile for transporting freight. In Ohio this was 89-100 of a cent, while the general average in all the States was 129-100 cents, being 45 per cent. more per ton per mile than in Ohio. 31 &apos; &quot;10 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 7.

DELINQUENT REPORTS. Reports were received from every company owning or engaged in operating a railroad, save the Columbus, Chicago and Indiana Central Railway Company. No report was received from W. H. Stevens, owning the Eastern Ohio Rail- road-a private road 7.75 miles long. The Price Hill Inclined Plane Railway failed to report. LENGTH OF LINE REPORTING TO THIS OFFICE. There has been a total of 13,914.987 miles of single main track and branches reported to this office, being an increase of 15.432 per cent. Besides this total, there are 456.897 miles of double track, a decrease of 0.568 miles; and 2,169.23 miles of sidings, being a decrease of 140.633 miles, or 6.09 per cent. These, alto- gether, make a total mileage of 16,541,114 miles, an increase of 1,719.154 miles, or 11.06 per cent. Ohio&apos;s proportions of these are, of single track and branches, 6,191.795 miles, or an increase of 6.10 per cent. ; of double track, 228.643 miles, an increase of 17.84 per cent.; of sidings, 1,340.043 miles, or an increase of 13 per cent; and of the total mileage, 7,760.481 miles, an increase of 7.55 per cent. &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 461 coal fields, but especially on the Toledo Division where the wide banks not only leave ample room for the ballast after it is adjusted but hold it when unloaded from the dump cars. This space between the foot of the ballast-slope and the outer slope of the bank is kept clean and free from weeds. On the Hocking Valley Division, board and rail fences only are Fences. found. The River Division is fenced with barbed wire and on the Toledo Division both barbed and wire fences are in use. The greater portion of the ballast on the Hocking Valley Division, Ballast from Columbus to Nelsonville, and through the coal branch lines, is the very best quality of furnace slag. On this part of the road slag is being substituted for other material, and no where in the State have I seen better ballast, and in more liberal quantity than is found here. This slag is undoubtedly the best material for ballast that has yet been found, and seems to possess all the desirable qualities that ballast should have, and to be free from faults common to other kinds. As used on this road, it affords a good solid bed for, and has a tenacious grip upon the ties. These are raised from eight to twelve inches above the road bed, and the slag is then put under and all about them, even around the ends to a level with their top surface, thus preventing, to some extent, lateral motion. On the remainder of this division, from Nelsonville to Athens, and on the parts which have not yet been reached with slag, gravel ballast is used. Gravel ballast is also made use of on the Ohio River Division and on the Columbus and Toledo Division, from Columbus to Sandusky. Between Sandusky and Toledo broken limestone has, to a great extent, been substituted for the gravel and sand formerly used, and at the rate this substitution is now going on, it will not be long until this end of the line will be entirely bal- lasted with broken stone. Ties are laid from 2,800 to 3,000 per mile, according to size. Sawed ties are generally uniform in size, but those hewn vary in width. Of late the company has obtained many hewn ties from the banks of the Kanawa river, in West Virginia. These are floated down the Kanawa and Ohio Rivers to Gallipolis to the company&apos;s landing there. They are of the best quality of White oak, and of extraordinary size, and cost from 25 to 38 cents a piece at Gallipolis. On the Hocking Valley Division many ties are more or less decayed, and occasionally a broken or crushed one is found; on the River Division the ties being compar- atively new are in good condition, but lighter than the average; this is especially the case with those on bridges and trestles on this line. On the Toledo Division more than 130,000 new ties have been put down within a year, and the work of replacing them is still going on. In fact, the work of improvement on this part of the road since last sum- mer seems almost incredible. At Columbus the Hocking Valley and Toledo Division trains leave from the Union Depot. The former has also a passenger station in the south-west part of the city, at the foot of Mound street, across the river &quot; &quot;SCIOTO VALLEY RAILWAY. Name of road. Scioto Valley Railway.

These, it is expected, will be adjusted in a few weeks, and again start work and traffic on the road. In the structures, not much change is noticed. Some deficiencies in the way of want of guard rails on some trestles, and defective ties which were pointed out as a result of last year&apos;s inspection, were cor- rected. No. 1. Beginning at Alliance, and going toward Phalanx, the first No. 1, wooden Howe. structure is a wooden Howe truss bridge, crossing the Mahoning river. It rests on stone masonry abutments. It is of the usual pattern, ex- cept that it has no end posts, and is 76 feet long. The lower chords consist of three pieces, 5, 6, 5 by 12 inches, with wooden clamps or packing block let into the chord timbers to the unusual depth of 24 inches. The floor beams are 5 by 12 inches, 22 to 24 inches apart, and there are two 5 by 12-inch track stringers under each rail. Ties are 5 by 7 inches, and spaced 18 to 20 inches from centers. There are no guard rails. The bridge is said to have been built in 1875, but looks much older. Although light in construction, and apparently beginning to suffer from age and decay, a careful examination disclosed no specific points of weakness anywhere in this bridge. zell trestle. No. 2. Following this about two miles from Alliance is the Hartzell No. 2, Hart- trestle; 10 spans, of 14 feet each from centers of points of support. The vertical and batter posts are 8 by 8 inches in cross section; sills and caps, 10 by 12 inches. Track stringers are 10 by 12 inches, there being one under each rail. Every bent is double cross or X-braced laterally, and eight courses of 5 by 5-inch longitudinal horizontal braces extend throughout the entire trestle. New ties and 8 by 6-inch guard rails have been put on this bridge since last year. No. 3. About three miles further or is a 12-span trestle, with &amp;quot;boxed&amp;quot; plumb and batter posts, its bents being 24 feet from centers. There are two 6 by 16-inch track stringers under each rail, which are trussed with a 14-inch iron rod. The truss rods are anchored in iron castings placed over the joints. The stringers rest on 8 by 14-inch corbels, which are 8 feet long. Post, sill and cap timbers are double, 4 by 9 inches in cross section. Bents are braced laterally by means of two (an upper and a lower) set of double cross or X-braces, which, however, are only spiked, and not bolted to posts, caps and sills. Four courses of longitudinal 6 by 6-inch timbers extend horizontally from end to end of the trestle. These are bolted to the vertical and batter posts, and are kept from sagging by being suspended from or supported by a system of light iron rods, a peculiar arrangement which I did not find anywhere else. The timbers in this work are sound, and the structure is of sufficient strength to support any weight which, in the course of ordinary traffic on this road, come upon it. The maximum height of the structure is 35 feet. No. 3, trestle. No. 4, the next structure, is a trestle and 2-span wooden Howe truss No. 4, trestle. deck bridge, over the Mahoning river, about eight miles from Alliance. &quot; &quot;616 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

Iron plate girder, 36 feet long, with stone abutments, all most excel- lent. Fink Truss, 100 feet long, 54 feet above the creek. There are long, deep fills on both approaches, and two stone arches of about 20 feet span at each end of the main bridge. I found it impossible to take any measurements. The bridge is a deck bridge, and there were neither ropes nor ladders whereby the structure could be reached. The flooring is all right, and there is proper protection in case of de- railment of cars. The bridge seems good and strong. Half Howe Truss; 8 panels, 6 feet each; 74 feet clear height; breadth, 14 feet. The braces are 5 by 6 and 7 by 74 inches; the rods in pairs, and vary from 1 to 13 inches; the lower chord has 3 pieces, 5, 8, and 5 inches wide, and 13 inches deep; the upper differs in the usual way; the road-beams are 6 by 13 inches; the track-stringers are 10 by 12 inches, broadside up, and notched 3 inches on the floor- beams: flooring, 6 by 8 inches, and 1 foot apart; ribbons, 8 by 10 inches, notched, and full bolted. There is a 20 foot approach, at each end of the bridge, supported by frame bents. Here the stringers are 12 by 14 inches, and are placed broadside up. Structure sufficiently strong. Part trestle and part regular Howe deck, over 800 feet long, and 54 feet above the bed of the stream. The bridge has been wholly rebuilt within 18 months. The stone piers are 50 feet apart, and between these a frame base is made for intermediate bents. The piers are built to such a height that 40 feet only remain for the framework of the trestle. These bents are double story, each 20 feet, with vertical and batter posts, and braces between the vertical and the batter posts. The base of the frame-bent is 20 feet from side to side, the timber being all foot-square oak. At the top of the lower story there are foot-square longitudinal braces, firmly bolted to the vertical posts, and to each other. The bays are thus made 25 feet lengthwise of the road. Abutting on the aforesaid longitudinal pieces are braces extending each way to the middle of the 25 foot span, and supporting a swinging cap. The intervals between the center of the supports is 12 feet. There are also the usual track-stringers, floor-beams, flooring, and guard-rails. The structure is completed, and is exceedingly strong- much better than any bridge ever before at this place. The trestle extends about 500 feet, and there are 5 spans constitut- ing the eastern part of the structure. The first span is 60 feet; the second, 78 feet; the third, 60 feet; the fourth, 53 feet; the fifth, about the same. The timbers in 4 of the spans are of the same size, viz., main braces, 7 by 8 inches; counters, 6 by 7 inches. The lower chord is composed of 3 pieces, 51, 8, and 5 inches wide, and 13 inches deep; the upper chord is of the same dimensions. The stay-braces are 7 by 7 inches; the laterals, 6 by 7 inches. The rods are in pairs, &quot; &quot;942 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. COST OF ROAD, EQUIPMENT, ETC.

Upper laterals, 13-inch rods at end of bridge, with the floor beams acting as struts. The sway bracing is distributed throughout at panel points. At the ends of trusses over piers and abutments, the sway tie rods are 13- inches. The short span is west. The east approach is the river bank. At the west end of the third pin the sway rods are 1ğ-inch diame- ter, made larger on account of placing onend of the 24-foot span plate girder of the west approach on the end posts of the west 56 foot span truss. This end post is the same in section as that for the other or long trusses. The plate girder is 3) inches deep; one web plate 5-16 inch thick, four angles 64 by § by about 4 inches. Two panels of laterals in the plate girder. At the east approach to this bridge, is a Latimer patent re-railing de- vice. It is placed about 100 feet from the bridge, and consists of a parallelogram or lozenge figure formed of rails spiked to the ties be- tween the track rails, stretching 48 feet along the track like guard rails, meeting in points at the ends and approaching the track rails at mid- dle, within about 2 inches at middle. At the middle portion, 11 feet length, are castings to aid in lifting the wheels. This has in several instances saved the wreck of a train and the bridge with it. See gen- eral remarks.

A strip of Right of way 5 miles near Girard is 25 feet. The fencing is mostly of boards. The standard barbed wire fence is, first wire, 8 inches above ground; second wire, 9 inches higher; third wire, 8 inches higher; then a 6-inch board with lower edge 12 inches still higher. Posts are 8 feet apart. Would not put a wire uppermost, as it damages the breasts of horses in the adjoining fields and injures their sale. Farmers object to the top wires, and this objection has been considered here. Some sidings have bad rails and short pieces. Much furnace slag ballast is in use on this line. It is stated that Ballast. there are fifteen furnaces and nine rolling mills at different points, and slag is plenty. The slag seen in the road is excellent, and in ample quantity. Some portions are 2 feet deep. At some places it is used as rip-rap. Some slag ballast and steel track, observed about 10 miles south of Ashtabula, was in splendid condition. From Ashtabula to Youngstown the track is all in slag ballast, and in good condition. The slag will probably be extended to the east State line within a year. The iron rails are 56 pounds in weight, there being about 45 miles Rail. of it. This is being replaced by 60 pound steel, 17 miles being now down, 13 miles being in the Lawrence Branch. No iron has been laid since last year, except where iron displaced by steel has been employed to make the remaining iron good. Six and a fourth miles of steel have been put down within the year. On steel rails the angle-bar splice, etc., is used, and for iron the fish-plates. Some iron, however, has the angle-bar. No creeping of rails has been experienced. The Wharton &amp;amp; Lorenz switch is used for steel rail, and the stub switch for iron. Cars are heated by the Bissell heater, and lighted by Mineral Seal oil of 300° flash. The Janney platform and coupler is in use. At New Castle is a car with jacks and blocks, portable forges, etc., but no derrick car is kept by the line. In passenger cars a cord runs along by the edge of the mansard, for passengers or conductor to set the automatic brakes with. Repairs are made at Erie or Pittsburgh. The round-houses are at Ashtabula. The Varona lock-nut is in use on the angle-bar fastening. These weigh 70 pounds per thousand, and cost $20 for that quantity. The traffic on this line was formerly light, but the numerous mills recently established along the line have bettered this. Now the traffic is heavy in coal and iron ore. Heating ani lighting cars.

The remaining track structures east of the west State line are small, and were not visited. General Statement. &amp;quot;The station buildings along this new road, as far as visited, are mostly substantial buildings, in fine architectural uniform design, and painted a light, subdued green, each being of capacity suited to its location. A commodious station building is going up at Cleveland in brick, with stone trimmings. But little attention appears, as yet, to have been given in this State to the matter of handling of freight. A few Y connections have been made to other roads, one, for instance, at Lorain, and one at Ashta- bula, but these are stated to be for the company&apos;s own purposes in pro- curing coal for engines. Through freight is beginning to be hauled between Chicago and the east. Passenger travel is also commenced in the running of trains regularly. The road-bed at the time of the visit, was in very good condition, in fact, excellent, considering the great length of the line constructed in so short a time, viz., over five hundred miles, Buffalo to Chicago, in eighteen months, and examined for this report in less than two years subsequent to the beginning of work. The preliminary surveys were commenced February, 1881, and the road was finished in construction the last of September, 1882, including ballasting. The track now rides with a smoothness equal to that of some older roads. Section men must have been busy from September to December in bringing the track to surface. The materials appear to be all of good quality in track and structures. Rails are steel; ties are oak; ballast mostly of good gravel; iron of bridges carefully tested, etc. Numerous tests of bridge iron were shown; also specimens of cold bend test pieces. These gave evidence of careful selection of bridge iron. Gravel for ballast is hauled long distances to insure a suitable quality. The designs of structures are worthy of consideration, and could not fail of being noticed by any careful observer. The uniformity and adaptation in station buildings has already been mentioned. The same is true in other respects. Iron bridges are remarkably uniform, especially as to the members. For instance, there is but one form of end post or top chord; one form of truss columns, one form of floor- beams, one form of stringers, etc., the latter being wood in all iron bridges in the State, with one exception. The object of the wood strings, apparently, is to relieve the entire structure of shocks due to moving trains by the yielding character of the wood.

The stringers are double, one piece 12, the other 6 inches broad, and both 14 inches deep. The west approach has 4 bents, constructed like the east side. The bridge has 9 panels, 12 feet each, and is very light. It is 14 feet wide, 214 feet high. The main braces in the center are 6 by 6 inches; the next, 6 by 7; then 7 by 8; 8 by 8; and 9 by 12 inches. The middle counters are 6 by 9 inches, and decrease to 6 by 6 at the end.

There is little or no fencing from Toledo to Delphos, and thence west Remarks. to the State line. The track is ballasted with sand for about 50 miles, and is well up, and about as even and smooth as a narrow road can well be, except occasional reaches of a mile or two each, which are bad. The ties are 6 feet long, and 6 by 7 inches. Ties of this size will, of course, easily get out of position, particularly when the ballast is indifferent. But there is a large force working at the track. In order to see the better how the road performs, so to speak, I caused the car to run, for a short distance, at the rate of thirty miles an hour, and there was no discomfort nor risk of accident, so far as I could tell. One new shop is 80 by 140 feet, and has 7 tracks and 6 pits. The Shops at Delphos. &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 287 are of peculiar and unusual design. But there is ample evidence of close watchfulness of all these structures, as indicated by the prompt application of provisional supports, such as trestle bents and cribs under lame bridges, and additional new stringers in old trestles. Also the renewals which are in progress are of a substantial character. Uhrichsville. Trestles. But south of Uhrichsville, as has been stated, the road is new be- South of cause this place was the southern terminus until about one or two years ago; hence, the structures are here new and sound, and many of them costly. The country, being very uneven, has required high and long trestles, numerous tunnels, and many bridges. But all of these are first-class as regards workmanship, and apparently so as regards mater- ials, and the trestles are the most remarkable of any found in the State for magnitude, elaborate design, and provision for repairs without in- terruption of trains. The bridges, however, are believed to be rather light for the heavier locomotives and freight trains-say, engines and tenders of 148,000 pounds to 50 feet length. The rails, from Lorain to near Canal Dover, are steel, and 56 pounds Rails. per yard, with angle-bar fastenings. The better old iron rails, as taken up for laying steel, have been relaid on the new portion south of Uhrichsville; 13 miles last year. The iron rail fastenings are fish plates. Rails are all laid with suspension joints, and alternating with those of the opposite rail. The iron rails are 56 pounds per yard. Twelve miles of new steel rail have been laid during the past year. Some rails marked “XI. 79.&amp;quot; Many bridges have steel rails. No trouble experienced from creeping, No precautions at curves or grades required. One curious double switch is in use at the crossing with the P., Ft. W. &amp;amp; C. Ry. It sets for one track or the other as trains require. The split switch and spring frog is in use here. Signals are of the ordinary kind; nothing peculiar. Trains are run by schedule and dispatchers. The ties are all white oak, and receive them ranging from 7 to 12 inches face by 7 inches thick. The ties used here are largely the so- called Virginia ties of white oak, and broad face. Widths of these ties run from 10 to 12 inches. The ties are all new; those of the north portion of the road having been renewed. They are laid 2,600 per miles, or two feet, center to center, in track. Sixty or seventy thousand new ties have been laid since last year&apos;s visit. Average present cost, 52 cents each. No bad ties seen in road. The ballast is stated to be all gravel.

It is an experience through which every road in a like situ- ation must pass, and endeavor to provide against by artifices suggested by the circumstances of the case. Structures remain in much the same condition in which they were last year, with some exceptions, to be noted in detail. Calculations made on many of the Howe truss bridges, based on measurements of parts, and on the assumed basis of a rolling load consisting of two consolidation engines, followed by a freight load of 2,000 lbs. per lineal foot, give resulting strains on iron tie rods of from 7,500 to 9,700 lbs. per square inch, effective section, and on wood 350 to 570 lbs. per square inch for compression and tension, the above being average re- sults obtained from structures located at various points on the line. The bridges on the Toledo line are all new, substantially built, wooden structures of the Howe truss pattern. On the Columbus branch are two wooden Howe truss bridges of an older date, and also a number of short span wooden bridges of other patterns. No. 1, not including the long pile bent trestle forming the approach to the passenger depot in East Toledo, and the docks adjoining it on the south, the first structure going southward from Toledo is a Howe truss bridge 100 feet long, over the L. S. and M. S. R. R. A descrip- tion of this will serve for every other bridge of its kind on this road, they being with slight modifications of dimensions of timbers, due to difference in length of span, almost exact counterparts of each other. The abutments supporting this bridge are oak timber pile bents, and consist of double rows of piles, with rows four and one-half feet from centers, and six piles in each row. They are braced laterally with two courses of 3 by 10-inch oak planks, spiked to each pile. The caps of these bents form the wall plates on which the bridge rests. There are eight panels, each being 12 feet 6 inches long. Height of truss is 23 feet. The lower chord contains four pieces, 6, 7, 7, 6 by 14 inches, and the upper chord is like it, except that its depth is only 12 inches. Lower and upper lateral braces are 6 by 6 inches, and lateral rods 1 inch in diameter. Floor beams, 6 by 14 inches, and spaced 20 and 22 inches from centers. Track stringers, two under each rail, each being 6 by 12 inches in cross section. Ties are 6 by 8 inches, and 12 inches apart. A 4 by 6-inch wooden guard rail is bolted to the ties, 18 inches outside of each rail. There are eight panels, exclusive of end post panels, each being 10 feet 10 inches in length. The main braces run 9 by 11 inches, 8 by 12 inches, 7 by 11 inches, and 6 by 11 inches, from end to center; coun- ters, same, 6 by 6 inches, 6 by 7 inches, 7 by 8 inches, and 8 by 8 inches; tie rods, same, three 2-inch diameter, three 17-inch, three 1§-inch, and three 18-inch.

Fences. Precaution at curves. Signals. Station buiid- ings. Heater. Lighting. Platforms. Wrecking tools. Brakes. Repair shops. Round houses Curvature of curves. Cattle guards. The line is mostly fenced, and by farmers and owners of land along the line. Fencing is mostly boards and rails. Barbed wire is up for one-half mile. Embankments are not very regular, owing to the varied conditions of surface along the line. Much trouble has been experienced by slipping of banks. This has been cured by piles, cribbing, and by light filling material, such as coal slack and cinder. At the sharp curves great caution is exercised to avoid accident. On some of the high trestles, where there are very sharp curves, the train seems almost to stop. Iron guard rails are put on inside the track rail at these sharp curves at trestles, and at three other curves. Both stub and point switches are used. No spring frogs are in use here. Only the cast-iron with chilled and steel face. The two trains per day are mostly run through by day. Signals are mostly by flag, bell, and whistle of the ordinary kind for these. There are but few station buildings along the line, at many stopping places, there being only platforms. At some places there are appar- ently individuals who carry on a private business in connection with the station business. At Woodsfield there is a very fine station build- ing. Speare&apos;s heater is used for car warming. &amp;quot;Ohio proof&amp;quot; head-light oil is used for lighting. Common platforms with the ordinary link couplings are used. A car with ratchet and screw tools. Jucks, and blocks, and tackle brakes. Eames&apos;s vacuum brake is used, but not accessible to passengers. Repair shops are at Bellaire, with only vises and forges. There are only two locomotive stalls at Bellaire, and two at Woods- field. No sand boxes on the locomotives. To put sand on rails a man gets off and does it with a shovel. Construction on this road commenced about five years ago, but the line has not been operated through but about two years. The stated maximum curvature of curves is 14 degrees, but the actual curvature of many curves is greatly in excess of this figure, as shown by the several results given in connection with trestles (see Nos. 7, 24, and 49). It is believed that some irregularities of curvature of line on road bed are due to lateral creeping of track, occasioned by workmen while tamping and adjusting. The cattle guards are of good and complete design. The pit is about 2 feet deep. Two 12 by 12-inch sills are placed cross-wise the track line. On these is placed a frame, consisting of two 12 by 12-inch sticks, beveled at top corners, upon which the rails lie; the same having their ends let into 4 by 12-inch planks about 1 inch, and spiked. The 4 by 12-inch sticks are about 10 feet long, and when in position, rest on the two sills above named. Also the ends of the 12 by 12-inch beveled sticks rest on the sills. The rails are spiked to these beveled sticks. &quot; &quot;CENTRAL OHIO RAILROAD. 727 Number: SUMMARY OF TRAIN ACCIDENTS. Accidents causing derailment of trains..........

The age of these, four in number, ranging from 60 to 72 feet in length, is about eight years. They are being in part renewed, and some are being entirely filled up. At a point near Kinsman, about 26 miles from Youngstown, there is a very old, through, single 100-foot span wooden 12-panel Howe truss bridge. The timbers of this are to all appearance still sound and firm, but lighter in section than appears desirable for heavy traffic. The lower chord is 5, 6, 6, 5 by 14 inches; end main braces, 8 by 9 inches, double; end tie rods, two, 14 inches, and one, 1 inches diameter; center counters, 7 by 9 inches; depth of truss, 22 feet 6 inches. The freight traffic over this line is of a rough and heavy character, consisting, mostly, of oar and coal. Although it does not receive the attention given to the main line, I cannot see that anything demanded for safety is being neglected. 1 II. PAINESVILLE AND YOUNGSTOWN RAILWAY, from Fairport, on Lake Erie, to Youngstown. This is a narrow gauge road, 61 miles in length. From Fairport to a point 13 miles south, the road bed is that of the old Painesville and Hudson railroad. It is here in good condition, as regards height of embankment, but is poorly ballasted. On other por- tions of the road the road bed is badly drained, flat, with side ditches entirely wanting, or so choked up with mud and debris, as to be of no 1 Summary of Finances and Business.

Mahoning Coal Railroad, from Ashtabula to Youngstown¹ From Ashtabula to Youngstown, under lease of the Lake Shore Railroad Company. Not much new work is noticeable on this line during the year. The track and road bed are in very good condition, and some of the smaller trestles open last year have been filled, and work in progress on the longer ones has been completed. • From Ashtabula southward, the first structure is a single track, single span wooden Howe truss bridge over Mill creek, between Plymouth and Jefferson. It is 130 feet long, and was built in 1880. There are ten panels, each 12 feet long, and truss is 22 feet deep. Lower chords, 6, 7, 7, 6 by 14 inches. Ties, 6 by 7 inches, 5 inches apart; guard rails, outer, 7 by 8 inches, wood, inner of railroad iron; main braces, double, 9 by 11 inches, outer pair; center counters, 7 by 8 inches; end tie rods, two, 1 inches, and one, 1 inches diameter. The bridge rests on pile bents. This bridge is covered. At Jefferson there is a pile trestle bridge, originally built in 1872. It contains 29 spans of 12 feet each, and its maximum height is 40 feet. Bents are 12 feet from center to center, well braced, transversely and longitudinally. Bent timbers, plumb and batter posts and caps and sills are 12 by 12 inches. Track stringers, double, 7 by 14 inches. Guard rail of wood, 4 by 4 inches outside, and one of railroad iron in- side of tracks. The trestle bridge between Jefferson and Dorset, 696 feet long, is like the one just described, but is at present undergoing reconstruction, being in part filled up and in part rebuilt with pile instead of framed bents. Over Mills creek there is a 100-foot span Howe truss deck bridge, built of good sound timbers. It has ten panels, each 10 feet 1-inch long, and depth of truss is 15 feet.

At Berea is another double track five-arch stone viaduct over Rock Berea, stone river, built in 1871. First class masonry, and in good preservation. viaduct. At Olmsted Falls, over west branch of Rock river, there is a six-arch Olmsted Falls, stone viaduct for double track; it was built in 1871. Over east branch of Black river, at Elyria, there is a two-arch stone viaduct for double track, built in 1872, and another five-arch double track stone viaduct over west branch of Black river, a short distance further on. Here the main line separates into two branches, both going as single track lines toward Toledo, one taking the direction along the lake shore through Sandusky, Port Clinton, etc., and the other, further south, through Monroeville, Clyde, Fremont, etc., both again uniting at Millbury, a station six miles east of Toledo. At Vermillion, over Vermillion river, there is a single track wooden Howe truss deck bridge, 150 feet long, built in 1874; covered. The ties are 7 by 8 inches; track stringers, double, 6 by 12 inches. There is an outer guard rail of wood, and an inner one of railroad iron.

Montgomery branch. 6, 7, 7, and 6 inches by 14 inches for the lower, and 12 inches for the upper chord. In the center truss, the end-panel has 5 main braces, then 3 in the second panel, 11 by 12 inches. There are three braces in each panel, and after the second they decrease 1 inch for each two panels as you go toward the center. In the end panel there are 5 rods 2 inches diameter, with ends upset; the remainder of the panels have three rods each, of 2 inches, 13, 14, and 14 inches respectively. The side trusses have 3 rods in the end panels, of 2 inches diameter; and the diameters diminish as those in the center truss. The side main braces are 11 by 12 inches in the end panels, and diminish to- ward the center inch for each two panels. The upper and lower lateral braces are 8 by 8 inches; the rods 11 inches. The sway-braces are 8 by 8 inches, and are in every panel. The width and height are each 22 feet. The floor-beams are 22 feet long, and 8 by 14 inches deep; and are 18 inches apart from center to center. The abutments are strong, triple frames, and although the bridge is in the form of a reversed canoe, it is able to bear any work or weight required of it. Near by is another trestle of 22 bents; 33 feet at the highest point; in process of completion; and although not as strong as the preceding, it is yet strong enough, unless under a heavy load at runaway speed. Howe Truss, 88 feet long; 22 feet wide; 22 feet high. The lower chord consists of four pieces, 6 by 14 inches; upper, 6 by 12 inches. There are 8 panels, 10 1-6 feet long, each. The main braces are in pairs, and vary from 10 by 12 to 8 by 10 inches. There are 4 floor- beams in each panel, and are trussed in pairs by a rod 13 inches diam- eter, having a drop of 21 inches. There is a good abutment on the west side; the east support is a good pier; at the east end of the bridge is a trestle of 6 bents, partly filled-will shortly be wholly filled. Over Bloody Run is a trestle of 22 bents, about 30 feet high, made like all the others on this line. It is but just to say that all the trestles and bridges on this line are able to carry standard gauge loads. From Blue Ash to Montgomery is a branch about 1 miles long; all right. &quot; &apos;CINCINNATI, HAMILTON AND DAYTON RAILROAD. 781 16 | John W.

The east approach trestle bents are made of 12 by 12-inch timber, with 4 batter posts and no plumb posts. East of the principal station in Cleveland, and within the city limits, there are some six or eight trestles of wood of various lengths and heights designed to be filled. These appear to be substantial, and in their present condition good for several year&apos;s service. They are mostly included below. Near Lake Cemetery, east, is a double trestle; another at Lake View Cemetery. Near the C. &amp;amp; P. R. R. crossing, east, at an ice pond, is a trestle in a curve, and about 30 feet high. Imme- diately west is another, some 500 feet long. Then another on a curve. Then another, straight. Then one at Grand Avenue, immediately east; also one immediately west. Then one just west of the next street. About a half mile east of the station is a through Howe truss, of wood, over a street. Depth of truss about 20 feet. Panels, 8, each being 10 feet 10 inches. Width of bridge, 31 feet, center to center; two tracks, 5 feet apart between ends of ties. Ties, 9 feet long. Braces at end panel, two, 11 by 12 inches; next two, by 11 inches.

Bottom and top laterals, 1-inch rods, and 8 by 9-inch struts. Bridge stands on abut- ment trestle frames of two bents combined by bracing, and about four feet between, each having twelve 12 by 12 inch upright sticks. The floor-beams are two, 7 by 16 inches, resting on lower chords, and trussed with one 23-inch rod with a pin connection at a central strut with shoe plate. These rods are upset and draw against plates seated at end top corners of beams. Strut about 6 feet long below bottom of beams. Rail to street, about 20 feet. The west approach is a fill. The east approach is a trestle, double track, 40 feet high. Bents are two-story; upper story, two plumb posts and four batter posts, all 12 by 12 inches; lower story, two plumb posts, and six batter posts, all batter equally and strongly inclined, and serve for bracing. Bents stand each on 6 pile heads. There are longitudinal stay timbers and bracing. The caps are one piece and mount the two tracks. Spans, 16 feet.

Tie rods, end set, two, 13-inch diameter. Floor beams, 6 by 14 inches, and 21 inches apart. Trestle No. 34, south of Krumroy, is now being filled up. Between this trestle and Canton there are eleven short span-from 10 to 23 feet-trestles of the simple stringer and trussed beam pattern, which have all except two, and workmen are engaged on these also. In several cases two and three span structures have been reduced to a single span, crossed by 12 or 16-inch track stringers, resting on stone masonry abutments. The work under way on this part of the road last year has been carried out and completed in accordance with the intentions indicated at last year&apos;s inspection. Beyond Canton, on the extension, the first structure is a Howe truss bridge over Nimishillen creek. It contains 10 panels, each 9 feet 7 inches. Depth of truss, 21 feet. Lower chord, 6, 7, 7, 6 by 12 inches. Floor beams, 7 by 14 inches, four per panel. Stringers, 6 by 12 inches. Ties, 4 by 6 inches, 10 feet long. Guard rail, 6 by 8 inches. Main braces at end, 10 by 12 inches. Tie rods at end, two 1-inch, and one 1-inch. At the crossing of Willow run and Myers run, south of Canton, there are at present good temporary trestle structures, to be replaced later by others of a more permanent character. No. 49. At another crossing of Nimishillen creek, one mile south of Industry, there is a through Howe truss bridge, containing 16 panels, each 9 feet 6 inches long. Depth of truss, 20 feet 9 inches. Lower chord, 7, 8, 8, 7 by 15 inches. Main braces at ends, two pieces 10 by 12 inches, and one 8 by 12 inches. Tie rods, two 2 inches diameter, and three 12 inches diameter. Floor beams, 7 by 14 inches, four per panel. Abutments are stone masonry. No. 49. At a small stream just south of the above, there is a 16- foot span trestle, supported by oak timber bents resting on rock found- ations. Bent timbers, caps, posts, etc., 12 by 12-inch timbers. No. 50, one mile north of Sparta, is like No. 494. It contains one center span 16 feet long, and a 12-foot span on each side of this. No. 51, next south, is again over Nimishellen creek. It is a 12-panel Howe truss bridge, each panel being 10 feet long and 20 feet deep. The lower chord is 6, 7, 7, 6 by 14 inches. End main braces, 9 by 11 inches. Rods, two 2-inch, and one 13-inch diameter. Floor beams, ties, stringers, etc., like those in previous structures of the same kind. The approaches to No. 51 are four spans of trestle on each end, with framed bent supports. No. 52 are 12 and 17-span trestle approaches to No. 53, and are of the same style of construction as the trestles over Peninsula and Cas- cade flats, at Akron. No. 53 is a Howe truss deck bridge, containing 12 panels, each meas- uring 9 feet 2 inches. The floor beams are suspended, 7 by 14 inches. Main braces, 9 by 11 inches at end. Rods, two 2-inch, and one 14-inch &quot; &apos;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 321 The north approach is a small Howe truss, 49 feet long; 6 feet 2 inches depth, not covered. Lower chords, 5, 8, 5 by 10 inches. End braces, 5 by 7 inches. Counters, 6 by 6 inches. End truss rods, two, 1 inches. Eight panels. New parts put into chords a year ago, and trestle bents put under. Abutments, trestle frames. Notwithstanding the repairs already made, this pony truss still shows the presence of so much decayed sap-wood as to give a very bad ap- pearance to it, especially on the southwest side. Further repairs appear to be contemplated, from the fact that some new chord sticks are still lying by. The aid from the temporary bents placed under is quite opportune. No. 134, trestling over Washington street, Tiffin; two trestles in street, with five 12 by 12 posts, and crossing sway braces of stout planks. Light, feeble trestle supports at edge of sidewalk and street. Stringers, two, 10 by 20 inches, pine; 22-foot span; 3 spans. South span has 2 sets of stringers; second span, 3 sets, and the third or north span has 4 sets of stringers. Tracks divide on this trestle bridge. Ties, 5 by 8 inches; 6 inches between, 10 feet long. Guards, new, 7 by 8 inches, bolted, each 3 or 4 feet, and notched. Safe. About 18 feet high. No. 14, a 5-span trestle. Strings. two, 7 by 16 inches. Spans, 16 feet. Trestles of two plumb and two batter posts, and cap and sill, all 12 by 12 inches. Sway braces on bents, 4 by 8 inches, X fashion. Banks held by planks. Over Wolf creek, 17 feet above water. This stream is very treacherous, damage being often done by a sudden rise and rush of water. This has occurred to other roads crossing this stream. A &quot;rip-rap&quot; of ties was thrown in to prevent wash, at one wing, in one emergency, which still remains. Much drift material sometimes comes down and clogs the water way. A bridge, with a clear opening, and stone abutments, with wing walls, appears to be especially desirable here. This opening is at a low point of grade, from both directions, and not near a station, so that trains usually pass at full speed, and often at excessive speed by reason of the down grade approaches. A raising of grade of 2 or 3 feet at this point seems advisable for considerations of speed. No. 15, a 31-foot pile trestle, with standard flooring. Nine feet high. No. 16, a wood through uncovered Howe truss of 84-foot span ; 22 feet depth; 6 panels. Six floor-beams per panel. Ties, standard. Wheel guards, 6 by 7 inches, on edge; notched and bolted. This bridge ap- pears old, and is light for the span. The splice joints give signs of drawing out; one or two have started to split off at the locks. The speed is slow, because near a station. Trestle bents have been added at the quarters since last year, making the structure safe. Height, 13 feet. Laterals, 1 inch rods, and 6 by 6 struts. The abutments are in form of T-walls, in cement or mortar. No. 131 trestle. No. 14, trestle. No. 15, trestle. No. 16, Howe truss. No. 17, stringers on piles.

S. and Send the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and St. Louis Railroads. The 56- and 60-pound iron is the most common. FENCING, BRIDGES, TRESTLES, AND TUNNELS IN OHIO. The number of miles of single fence reported is 7,518.25. Many of the companies report &amp;quot;all fenced,&amp;quot; without specifying the number of miles; and since there are, quite frequently, in towns and elsewhere, several miles that are not required to be fenced, it is impossible to tell from such answers the number of miles that are actually fenced. As to the condition of the fences, and the number of miles on each road fenced, reference is made to the reports of the engineers and the reports of the companies. There are reported 1,522 bridges in the State, aggregating 154,492 feet in length. This is a decrease of twenty-three bridges, but an increase of 15,396.8 feet. Of these, 936 are wood, with a length of 97,591 feet, being a decrease of six bridges, and an increase of 6,996.9 feet. The Little Miami R. R. re- ports wooden bridges 25 years old; the Cincinnati and Muskingum Valley, 22 years old; the Central Ohio, 21 years old; and the Marietta and Cincinnati, 20 years old. The reports show 347 iron bridges this year, with a length of 38,759 feet; this is an increase of 71 bridges and 8,660 feet. The oldest iron bridges-30 years are reported by the Central Ohio R. R. Co. The Toledo, Cincinnati and St. Louis R. R. gives the age of some as 21 years, and the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago R&apos;y Co. as 19 years. Eighty-one combination bridges are reported, with a length of 6,608 feet, a decrease of 72 bridges, and 86.4 feet. The oldest reported are on the Valley Railway, and are 19 years old. The stone arch bridges number 153, with a length of 10,649 feet, a decrease of 15 bridges and 558.6 feet. The oldest, 31 years, is reported by the Cleve- land and Pittsburgh R. R. Several roads report stone bridges 21, 22, 27 and 82 years old. Six pile bridges on the Pittsburgh, Ft. Wayne and Chicago R&apos;y are reported as being renewed every five years; their length is 164 feet. There are 2,534 trestles reported in the State, with a length of 292,111 feet. This is an increase of 395 trestles and 22,160 feet. The longest, 4,130 feet, is found on the Toledo, Canada Southern and Detroit R&apos;y. One 4,000 feet long, is reported by the Connotton Valley Railway. The highest, 66 feet, is on the Cleveland, Mt. Vernon and Delaware R. R. The Connotton Valley reports trestles 65 feet high; the Cincinnati Eastern 62 feet high; the Cleveland, Tuscarawas Valley and Wheeling report some 60 feet high. The oldest, 14 years, is on the Dayton and Michigan Railroad. &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 651 Number. Names.

Older bridges on the main line, when taken out to be replaced by new ones, are reduced in span, and go to replace a trussed beam or part of a trestle on the coal branches where the traffic is not so heavy. On the Ohio River Division (formerly the Ohio and West Virginia R&apos;y) the first bridge south from Logan is a low Howe truss, 51 feet span, over Old Town creek. It contains seven panels, each 7 feet 3 inches long, and 8 feet 1 inch deep from center to center of chords. Lower chords, 6, 8, 6 by 12 inches; upper, 6, 8, 6 by 10 inches. Ties, 5 by 8 inches, and 18 inches center to center. End main braces, 8 by 8 inches. Counters, throughout, 6 by 7 inches. Tie rods, two, from 1 to 14 inches at center. End posts, 5 by 10 inches. Floor beams, 7 by 14 inches, and 20 inches from centers. Stringers, single, 10 by 10 inches. Lower laterals, struts, 6 by 6 inches. Ties, 1-inch rods. The floor beams in this are suspended. The bridge rests on stone masonry abutments. The next bridge is a two-span combination Pratt truss, built by Mc- Nairy, Claflin &amp;amp; Co., of Cleveland, and crossing the Hocking river about two miles beyond Logan. The spans are of unequal length. It is approached from the north by 22 spans of trestle work. The first span has 7 panels, each 12 feet 6 inches long, and the next or south span has 8 panels, each 12 feet 3 inches long, and 21 feet in depth. The dimensions of the long span are: Lower chord, end panel, two bars 4 by 4-inch, two bars 4 by 13-16 inch, four bars 4 by 3-inch, four bars 4 by -inch, and at center four bars 4 by 1-inch. Upper chord, four pieces, wood, 4 by 12 inches. Main braces at end, two bars 5 by 15-16 inch, two bars 33 by 3-inch, two bars 3 by 3-inch. Counters: at center one 1-inch rod, one 18-inch rod, and one 1-inch rod. Posts at ends, four pieces, 4 by 12 inches; next parel, one, 9 by 15 inches, 9 by 13 inches; and at center, 9 by 10 inches, wood. Floor beams are plate I-beams, 22 inches deep, 3-inch web, and 5 by 4-inch angle irons for flanges. Hangers, two 13-inch U-rods. Pins, from 2 to 3 inches diameter. Track stringers, three under each rail, 6 by 14 inches, and one under guard rail at end of ties also 6 by 14 inches. Lateral rods, 1 inch and 1-inch diameter. The bridge rests on stone masonry abut- ments and pier. Between this point and Vinton there are a number of low Howe truss through bridges, resting on stone masonry abutments, each of one span, varying in length from 50 to 72 feet, and all built on the same principle. The first one of these, which will serve as a model for all the rest that approximate it in length, is as follows: Nine panels, each 6 feet 9 inches long, and 9 feet 1 inch deep from center to center of chords. Lower chord, 6, 8, 6 by 15 inches; upper, 6, 8, 6, by 10 inches. Main braces, from end to center, 8 by 8 inches to 8 by 6 inches. Counters throughout, 6 by 7 inches.

Fences. Ballast and features of the road. Ties. Rail. The road is entirely fenced from Cleveland to Carrollton, a distance of eighty-seven miles, and in part only from the latter point to Sher- rodsville-fift en miles. With but slight exception, the fence in use is the almost universal post and (five) barbed wire railroad fence. A few miles of the lower (Sherrodsville) end of the road is ballasted temporarily with coal slack. The ballast in use on the road proper is a good quality of gravel which is used in liberal quantity, and is ob- tained from the company&apos;s gravel banks at Oneida and near Kent, and to a smaller extent from cuts through gravelly ridges at other points on the road. In many places the ballast is carried on a level with the top surface of the ties to their extremities, and then by an easy natural slope down to the embankment, which latter is kept smooth and scrup- ulously clean of weeds and grass, as already stated to a distance of several feet outward from the gravel. If the practical result afforded by this in the speedy and effective drainage it ought to secure is at all commensurate with the very pleasing effect it gives to the road-bed as seen from the rear platform of a moving train, it is certainly worth the little extra attention required to make and keep it so. In fact if this &amp;quot;sand-papering&amp;quot; (as it is called, I believe) of the roadway had no other result than to call into exercise the ambition and pardonable pride of the section foreman, within whose jurisdiction it is found, it is commendable as an example in order and neatness. Some of the soil composing the road bed is a clay of peculiar character, which ab- sorbs bodily the ballast laid on top of it, and instances were pointed where the third full layer-from twelve to eighteen inches thick-of good gravel ballast was being placed under and about the ties. In other long places, where in the original construction of the road it was in- tended to carry the roadway over on embankment, piles were subse- quently driven with ease to a depth of nearly sixty feet. The details of the engineering constructions, made necessary to overcome the dif- ficulties met with in the peat bogs of Stark and Portage counties would afford an interesting chapter of experience in railroad construction, not by any means on account of their gigantic character, but because of their unlooked for and perplexing nature. The ties are yet in good condition. They are of usual dimensions, both sawed and hewn, and are six and one-half (6) feet long, being laid 2,816 per mile, or at the rate of sixteen under a thirty-foot rail. On bridges and trestles they are, as a rule, laid four (4) incher apart, and are here also, in some instances, 8 by 8 inches, instead of 8 by 6 inches in cross-section. The track is from Canton north, a 42-pound, and from Canton south a 35-pound steel rail, 23 inches high, and secured with double angle plates at the joints, with two bolts through each rail. The switches in use throughout the line are the common stub switch, purposely adopted, I am informed, in preference to the split switch, which was tried, but with unsatisfactory results. &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 477 XVII. THE EASTERN OHIO RAILROAD, from Point Pleasant, a station on the Cleveland and Marietta Railroad, to the town of Cum- berland, in Guernsey county. This is a local road, eight miles long. Very little attempt at establishing a grade seems to have been made. Grade.

There are no &amp;quot;open&amp;quot; bridges, but it has six trestles from forty-five Trestles. to one hundred and five feet in length, with fifteen feet span, as a stan- dard, between points of support, which supports are, except in one case, timber bents of the usual style, namely, with two vertical and two batter posts, resting on a ground sill, and surmounted by a cap on which the track stringers rest. The sills, posts, and caps are oak tim- bers, 10 by 12 inches, and in some cases, 12 by 12 inches in cross sec- tion. Track stringers are single hewn oak beams, 12 by 14 inches, except in one case where the span over a narrow water-course is nine- teen feet, and the track stringers are doubled under each rail. One of the six trestles mentioned has pile bents. The timbers on all these structures are sound, and in fair condition. The traffic of the road is light, and trains run at a very moderate rate of speed. The trestles are, however, insufficiently braced, both laterally and longitudinally, and the entire absence of guard rails, together with the great interval between ties, renders them insecure in case of derailment and other accidents to trains while passing over them. The change of owner- ship contemplated at date of last year&apos;s inspection had not been effected in September of this year. Parties were then at work extend- ing the line a few miles north-eastward. The general appearance of the road near its junction with the Cleveland and Marietta, at Point Pleasant, showed no changes and little improvement from that of last year. &quot; &apos;DAYTON AND MICHIGAN RAILROAD. 1097 Proportion for Ohio, 1504 miles.

Congress Lake trestle. Trestle. Mogadore, high trestle. Kent. Howe truss. in the car-sheds here twenty-two new first-class passenger coaches be- longing to the equipment of the road. At the crossing of Nimmishillan creek, north of Canton, stone ma- sonry abutments for an iron bridge, to take the place of the trestle now in use there, are in process of construction, and the same is being done at two other points about one mile north from this. At Congress Lake is a 30-span pile trestle, there being six piles in each bent, four under the space between guard rails, and one on each side, 4 feet outside, the latter being drawn in and bolted to the others. The track stringers, corbels, and caps are all 12 by 12 inch timbers. About one mile north of above is another trestle of the same kind, having ten spans. In this the outer piles are not drawn in at the top. One-half mile north from Mogadore is a high trestle, which is double, cross braced transversely, and has also one set of longitudinal cross braces extending from bent to bent. It has, in addition to the custo- mary wooden guard rails, an inner one of railroad iron. From Kent to Bedford are found a number of short framed bent trestles, one, two to five span. Several of these are now being filled up, two are being replaced with stone culverts, and in case of others stone masonry abut- ments for more permanent open truss bridges are now being built. The trestles, having served their purpose in carrying construction trains, which are being used to haul material for these permanent bridges, are now being taken out to be used for a like purpose further on, where track laying has just begun. Of the iron bridge at Kent, detailed drawings and specifications and strain sheets were shown me by the chief engineer of the road. These having been noted, were subsequently compared with measurements of all important parts of the bridge, and found to agree in every par- ticular where a comparison was made. It is a Pratt truss bridge, built by the Canton Wrought Iron Bridge Company, and is 161 7-10 feet long, from center to center of lower chord pins. It rests on cylindri- cal wrought iron pillars, filled with concrete, and supported oh good stone masonry abutments. The original intention was to place the bridge directly on the stone masonry, which would have made a cross- ing at grade of the track of the N. Y., P. &amp;amp; O. Railroad immediately south of this bridge. This was afterwards changed to an overhead crossing of the road mentioned, which necessitated raising the bridge seventeen feet higher than was at first intended, and hence the use of the four wrought iron cylinders for bridge supports. The bridge contains 11 panels; depth of truss, 30 feet; weight of structure, 900 pounds per foot, rolling load assumed at 2,000 pounds per foot, with one panel, on an advancing train, at 8,000 pounds per foot; lower chord, from end to center, two bars, 24 by 1 1-16 inches, 3 by 1 1-16 inches, 5 by 1 3-16 inches, 5 by 1 3-8 inches; upper chord, two rolled 12-inch channel bars, 20 pounds per foot; and one, by 18 inch plates over 1st, 2d and 3d panel; 3d and 4th the plate is § by 18 inches, and over center, by 18 inches. &quot; &quot;LITTLE MIAMI RAILROAD. 1183 CHARACTERISTICS, ETC.

In consequence, where there are side cuts, the ties are sunk and almost submerged in the mud, which touches in places the lower surface of the rails. The ballast is very thin, and entirely worn away in many places. This was the condition of the road last year, and no improvements are perceptible this year. The work done appears not to have kept pace with the natural wear and tear of traffic, and deterioration from effects of the weather. At the very worst places, a few new ties have been put in, some of cedar and a few of maple and beech. Additions have been made to the locomotive and passenger equip- ment, and some buildings intended for shops, car sheds, round houses, etc., are under way at Painesville. The general condition of the road at this date is not such as due regard for comfort or safety of passen- gers requires. The portion of the road from Painesville to Fairport Harbor on the lake is used for freight traffic only. It is the best part of the line as regards condition of track, road bed and bridges. The rail is a light 32-pound iron, somewhat worn and battered, and by reason of the faults in the road bed already pointed out, not in good line or surface. Near Fairport Harbor is a 17-span trestle, which is the north ap- proach to a Howe truss draw bridge. It is a pile trestle, with bents 15 feet from center to center, each rail being supported by a single 12 by 12-inch stringer. The ties are new, 6 by 8 inches, well spaced and held in place by a 4 by 6-inch wooden guard rail, let into them at a depth of 1 inch and fastened down with iron spikes. The timbers in this structure are all in good condition, the whole work having been recently thoroughly overhauled. It is a good, strong work. Following this, going southward, and immediately adjoining it, is an old Howe truss draw bridge, containing 12 short panels, and resting on pile foundation. Its lower chords consist of three pieces, 4, 9, 4 by 10 inches. All its parts are old and decaying, and although examination discloses no specific points of weakness or immediate danger, the whole structure has evidently outlived its usefulness in its present condition. Two iron angle blocks were found to be broken. Following the above is a 12-panel Howe truss bridge, 106 feet long. The lower chords are 5, 6, 6, 5 by 13 inches; two end main braces, each 8 by 10 inches, and three end tie rods, each 1 inches in diameter. Floor beams are 6 by 12 inches, four in each panel. Track stringers, double under each rail, 6 by 12 inches; cross ties, 6 by 8 inches, spaced two feet from center to center. There is no guard rail on any part of the bridge. The timbers of this structure throughout are in fair condition. A short trestle connects the south end of this bridge with the west bank of the river. About two miles south of Painesville is a trussed beam 54 feet long, which forms the northern approach to the stone viaduct. The beam consists of two pieces of oak, 15 by 15 inches, laid one above the other, &quot; &quot;121 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. PRIVATE RAILROADS. The Salineville Branch Railroad, three and a half miles long, was the only private railroad that reported this year. Its cost is $30,000. It is used in transporting coal from the mines to the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad at Salineville Station. Many other such roads are owned by persons engaged in mining interests in the State, but they hardly rise to the diginity of railroads. INCLINED PLANE RAILWAYS. The companies report a length of plane, of 1.03 miles; a length of street railway track of 13.25, 10.25 miles of which are double track ;. a paid up capi- tal stock of $1,310,050; a funded debt of $425,000; a floating debt of $109,- 042.03; a cost of plane of $84,138.86; of railway tracks, etc., $83,015.13 and a total of $360,348.65. RAILWAYS IN PROGRESS. A length of 1,514.54 miles of roads in progress has been reported, 794.33 miles of which are in Ohio. Several roads in process of construction were unable to make reports that were satisfactory, even to themselves. The tabula- tions of the reports that were received are put, this year, into the general tables of the roads in operation, making the tables of stock, debt and length, state- ments of those items for the 30th day of June, so far as they were able to be ascertained from the reports filed. CAPITAL STOCK. The total capital stock of the Ohio Railway Companies, authorized, amounts to $567,548,751.32¹ being an increase of $144,995,562.40 or 34.08 per cent. The following table gives the respective amounts authorized for each of the fifteen years just passed: &apos;This amount includes the capital stock of roads in progress, and hence the great increase over last year&apos;s figures which did not include the stock of roads in progress. &quot; &quot;CINCINNATI, HAMILTON AND INDIANAPOLIS RAILROAD. 787 Length in Ohio, distributed as follows: County.

The casualties were distributed as follows: Passengers. Employes. Total. 104 276 380 783 805 1,588 From the foregoing it will be seen, that on the roads reporting to Ohio nearly 20 per cent. of the derailments were due to misplaced switches, and in the United States, a little more than 15 per cent. were due to the same cause. Loose or spreading rail, on Ohio roads, caused 6 per cent. of derailments, and in the United States, 10 per cent.; broken rail, 5 per cent., both on Ohio roads and in the United States; broken axle, 7 per cent., both on Ohio roads and in the United States; and cattle on track, 6 per cent., on both. On Ohio roads, 25 per cent. of collisions were due to careless running, 15 per cent. to train breaking in two, 13 per cent. from failure to use, or absence of signals, and 12 per cent. from absence of, mistake in, or disobedience to, orders. It will be noticed, in comparing the Ohio railroads with those of the United States, that on about one-eighth of the mileage (that reporting to Ohio) there. have been more than one-half of the train accidents; and, also, that the casual- ties have been only about one-twelfth as many.

THE COLUMBUS, HOCKING VALLEY AND TOLEDO RAILWAY! This railroad system comprises, under one general management, the Hocking Valley Division, from Columbus to Athens, 76 miles, includ- ing also the Straitsville Branch, from Logan to Straitsville, 13 miles; Monday Creek Branch, from Nelsonville to Straitsville, 19 miles; Snow Fork Branch, 3 miles; Sand Run Branch, 14 miles; total, 113 miles; the Ohio River Division, (formerly the Ohio and West Virginia Railroad,) from Logan to Pomeroy, through Gallipolis, 83 miles. The Toledo Division, from Columbus to Toledo, 124 miles, making a total length of line of 320 miles. In addition, the unusual number and length of side and yard tracks-about twenty miles of which are be- tween Columbus and Logan, making nearly one-half of this portion of the road a double track-will probably aggregate forty-five miles more. The Hocking Valley Division main line, and a portion of the Straits- ville Branch is laid with a sixty-pound steel rail; the Ohio River Divis- ion is all laid with 56-pound steel rail, and on the Toledo Division all except the portion from Alveda to Rising Sun-about 15 miles-is laid with 60-pound steel rail. On older por.ions of the road a fish-plate bar, secured with four bolts, is used to fasten joints, but in all new constructions the double angle-bar is used. On portions of the Hock- ing Valley Division a cast iron triangular anchor or brace is spiked to ties against the outer side of the outer end in some cases, also against the inner rail, as an additional precaution against spreading of rails on curves. The embankments are well kept up and it is the practice of road- masters to build them up and widen them on top at the expense of the useless earth, which clogs ditches and side cuts in loose and sliding soil. The effect of this work is observable in the lines through the 1 Summary of Finances and Business. Columbus, Hocking Valley and Toledo Railway: Miles owned......

COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 235 At Bellaire is a round-house, 12 stalls, with repair shops for freight cars and engines, and for making freight cars, including several dif- ferent buildings. At Zanesville are car works, where 750 cars per year can be made, and a large amount of iron work for bridges, though not the heaviest. At Newark are repair shops and works; a 32-stall round-house, coal chutes with inclined track for locomotive to haul up coal dump-cars by the train; a 60 by 100 feet store-house; a 70 by 100 feet boiler-house; a 70 by 150 feet machine-shop, 2-story; a blacksmith-shop, same size, 1-story; a 70 by 200 feet foundry; a paint and pattern shop, same size as last; a 30 by 80 feet engine and boiler-house for power; and a 30 by 80 feet house for oil and waste. At Chicago Junction a machine-shop, 10 by 100 feet; smith-shop, 40 by 50 feet; and a 14-stall round-house. At Sandusky a 14-stall round-house. At five points in Ohio are reservoirs for water for round-houses. At Shawnee is a turntable and a house for one locomotive, and a re- pair bench. At Columbus is a round-house. At Sandusky there are repair shops for five cars at once, and for three engines. The shops include some heavy machine tools, and a round- house of 10 stalls. Construction and repair shops and round-houses facilities. At Bellaire the company has several miles of track serving to give Terminal access to the round-house, the shops, the Ohio river wharves, and sev- eral lines of railroad that enter here. These tracks branch from the main line at about a mile up from the town, at such point as the grade of the stone viaduct and of the side tracks will permit. At the shore of river the track passes under the viaduct, 40 feet below the main line track. These tracks pass under the viaduct at two points, and ex- tend to and nearly encompass the city. A surface of several acres is occupied by these tracks and buildings, all being kept neat and tidy in appearance. At Sandusky the company has three wharves for transfer of freight between boat to car. On one is a grain elevator, on another a freight house and a lumber pier of 1,000 feet, with two tracks; also with coal dumps for discharging coal from car upon dock. A third pier is for iron ore. South of these are yards and bunks where ore is dumped to await more convenient shipment by car. From the docks some three or four tracks extend back for nearly a mile. Several vessels can be accommodated here at once. Large quantities of Lake Superior iron ore is handled here, and when more storage room is required than the dock affords, it is hauled off to yard-room about a mile distant. Of course the road has its numerous sidings and freight houses along the line, for handling local freight, but the principal part of the com- pany&apos;s business appears to be through freight. One point made is to give quick transit for stock cars between Chi- cago and the East. &quot; &apos;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 231 The standard cross-section of the road-bed, bank, ditch, etc., is here 5&quot; 7 sketched. It represents the two curves of gravel ballast and stone ballast. For the former, the crown of the bed is nearly flat, as shown by the full line and hatchings. On this the gravel is placed, with several inches under the tie, and carried up to the dotted line along the tie, as shown, and crowned, so that at the middle of the track the ties are nearly buried, while at the ends the gravel is but slightly higher than the bottom side of the ties. This carries the water off, and allows the ends of the ties to dry out. The side of the bank is sloped from the tie to five feet from the rail, where the ditch or slope of the embankment begins. The ditch, at summits, is 18 inches wide by 8 inches deep, as indi- cated; but at distances along downward from the summit the ditch is made deeper and wider, to provide for the accumulation of water. When stone ballast is put on, the ties are raised to provide room for the ballast. Then the ballast is brought even with the tops of the ties and slopes off at the ends from the top and end corners, as shown by the sloping dotted line. The lower full line shows the position of the earth-bed relative to the ties when stone ballast is used. Some- times the original earth-bed is clipped off near the ditch to give an effective general slope toward the ditch. This standard is quite carefully carried into practice on the Colum- bus and Newark Division, and on the Chicago Division long stretches of it are seen. On some divisions the form of the cross-section is com- paratively indefinite, though everywhere the road-bed is ample in dimensions, and the track is well surfaced and ballasted. In the lat- ter cases it appears that the intention is to secure a good, safe, and easy riding track rather than spend the means in mere show. At some points in the Chicago Division ballast is carried 125 miles. The ditches are not always perfectly clean, though they are not found filled, and they are well down below the ties. Where water is likely to make trouble the ditches are kept cleared. At some portions of the lines the right of way is quite weedy, par- ticularly so on the L. E. Division. But men are kept at work with the scythe cutting the weeds and grass as far as twenty feet at least from the track. Within this distance most attention is given to the appear- ance of the right of way. Beyond the twenty feet named, the surface is frequently quite irregular, with pits and piles of earth as left after road building. Everything, however, that affects the safety of the traveller is carefully looked after. That is, fences are well kept up to keep cattle off, and old ties and worthless material is disposed of to &apos; &quot;PITTSBURGH AND LAKE ERIE RAILROAD. 1397 • State of Pennsylvania, County of Allegheny 88.: W. C. Quincy, General Manager of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad Com- pany, who being duly sworn, deposes and says that he caused the foregoing state- ment to be prepared by the proper officers and agents of this Company, and having carefully examined the same, declares them to be a true, full, and correct statement of the condition and affairs of said company, on the thirtieth day of June, A.D. 1882, to the best of his knowledge and belief. (Signed) [SEAL OF R. R.] W. C. QUINCY, General Manager. Subscribed and sworn to before me, this 21st day of August, A. D. 1882. [SEAL.] W. W. GORMLY, Notary Public. &quot; &quot;230 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. Fences at cat- tle guard. A dam. Permanant way. This signal is free from the ambiguity of some others; such, for in- stance, as that of a swinging cross-bar, used horizontal for one of the intersecting roads, and diagonal for the other, for &amp;quot;go ahead.&amp;quot; This signal at a triangular intersection of three roads (a triangle of a half mile or so being inclosed) would, for one of the roads, be horizontal at one, and diagonal at the other crossing point. But it seems desira- ble that the same &amp;quot;go ahead&amp;quot; signal be employed at railroad crossings throughout the length of any one road. At cattle guards the fences coming in from the right-of-way fences are mostly whitewashed, one object being to help the engineman to a more complete warning of the road crossings. At Mt. Vernon the railroad company takes water of the city water works. At Shawnee a dam 180 feet long of reservoir for water to machinery, was made by digging two trenches 10 feet apart in the original soil to several feet depth, then setting 2 by 10 inch planks up on end, and nailing them together side by side, into firm breastworks 10 inches thick, one to each ditch; then puddling with fire-clay around the bot- toms of the plank partitions in the ditches; then filling outside the planking to 12 to 1 foot, and 2 to 1 feet with earth, and between the planking with filling and fire-clay puddling. No trouble has been ex- perienced with this for leakage. Near bridge No. 10, east of Newark, was shown some displaced ma- sonry, which was laid with a cement made at Barnesville. Projecting lumps of this cement appeared very hard, and when knocked off would take sandstone flakes with it, showing that the cement hardened to a greater degree than the hardness of the Ohio sandstone blocks of old masonry. Iron work is stated to be painted about every third year. Mr. Lee states that there are only about six or eight wood string cul- verts east of Newark, most culverts having iron I-beam struts and stone masonry. Consolidation engines of 80 tons, when in service, are stated to be in use on the main line through Ohio. A neat station, in brick, at Norwich, east of Newark, has three rooms, a ladies&apos; and gents&apos; room, each 14 by 18 feet, and a central freight and ticket and telegraph room, 8 by 21 feet. Men were seen mowing the grass and weeds each side the track to a distance of twenty feet from the track. At curves, telegraph poles are inclined in such a way that the lateral thrust due to the pull of the wires is nearly counteracted. A prop is put against the poles besides. The embankments and cuts are of ample width, and the ballast is of good quality and quantity. To secure the desired ballast it is fre- quently hauled long distances, and sometimes from one division of the road to another. &quot; &quot;PITTSBURGH, CINCINNATI AND ST.

North approach to the Scioto river bridge; about 2,000 feet long; in fair condition, having, in 1882, been thoroughly overhauled and re- paired. Most of the bridges and trestles from Columbus to Chillicothe have had new flooring and ribbons put on, or in process of going on. The track between these cities has been very greatly improved since the first report, although much yet remains to be done. There is but little danger from water on this part of the road. In the above account only part of the trestles are given, as will be seen by scanning the numbers on the margin. In order to show more fully the work done since the last report, I beg leave to add the follow- ing statement: Trestles numbered 11, 17, 23, and 28 have been entirely renewed. Nos. 12, 13, 16, 26, 29, 30, 31, and 32 have new tops; i. e., new string- ers, ties, and guard-rails. No. 15 is all new, excepting two of the pile bents; 35 has new sills, new top, and three new bents; 36, the long trestle-2,000 feet-at Chillicothe, has had 700 new ties put on, the frame bents have been renewed or repaired, new guard-rails put on, and, in fine, is in excellent condition. 3. Main Line, from Chillicothe to Portsmouth. Howe Truss, 3 spans, 150 feet each; 14 panels; width, 14 feet; height, 21 feet. The main braces range from 6 by 12 to 11 by 12 inches; ends inclined; counters, 7 by 8 to 7 by 9 inches; lower chord, four pieces, two 6 and two 7 inches wide; all 14 inches deep; the upper chord is 11 inches deep; the rods are by threes, and range from 11 to 13 inches; road beams, 6 by 12 inches, and 2 feet apart. Abutments and pier of wood; pier is of piles. The south approach is a good 75-foot trestle. The north approach has 23 bays, of 15 to 16 feet, then a 20-foot span, and a trussed girder 32 feet long, having three beams on each side, 12 by 20 inches, and two 21-inch rods; then 22 pile spans, firmly cross- braced, and 22 feet high to the top of the rail. The whole trestle-work is very good. &quot; &quot;226 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. Standard frog. System of su- pervision. Departments of road man- agement. Computa- tions for max- imum strains. Object sig- nals. much study. It is the design of Mr. David Lee, the Master of Roads west of Bellaire, and of Mr. Hudson, a former Superintendent. The frog adopted as standard is the spring rail frog, especially as an accompaniment of the Lorenz switch at points passed at speed. At such points the spring rail lies in the position to form continuity of the main line rail, from which position it is pressed or sprung to one side as a train takes the side track. Only one rail is made a spring rail in such cases. The guard rails at these frogs are held by angle brack- ets, well secured. This frog was adopted by this road three years ago for all main lines of track, but not for side tracks and yards, for the reason that engines might stand over the spring rail and drop water that would freeze the rail fast in winter. This is not likely to occur on main line, as engines are not allowed to stand here long at a time. In winter men are charged with the duty of looking after these spring rails, to see that they do not get frozen fast. For fifteen years previ- ous to the adoption of the spring frog, the &amp;quot;movable rail&amp;quot; frog was standard. It required the same precautions against sticking by frosts. The system for supervision of roads is quite thorough. There is a master of roads, and an assistant master for general supervision of all west of the Ohio river. In addition, there is a supervisor of track for each 50 miles of road, and a foreman of track every 5 miles, or for each section. The section has from 5 to 10 section men. The stand- ard section is 5 miles, and the number of men 5. This is varied, how- ever, to local demands. On the Columbus and Newark Division the sections have 1 1-5 men per mile. Besides these, there is a general supervisor of bridges over all west of the Ohio river, and an assistant supervisor for each 150 miles. There is a carpenter&apos;s gang with its foreman for about each 50 miles. These gangs are shifted about some as the condition of the work at different points demands. The road management has three departments, viz.: Transportation, Machinery, and Roads, each with its master. Computations for the maximum strains of many of the iron bridges reported upon have been made. The results show that the usually ac- cepted safe maximum of 10,000 pounds for a square inch is but rarely exceeded, and then but slightly. The qualities of iron in the struct- ures can not be given, because tests can not be made on pieces while in existing structures. Details in addition to those given in this report may be obtained by consulting the books of original field notes. The object signals of this road are reduced to what appears to be a well chosen system. At 800 feet from a railroad crossing is an oval board, as shown in the &quot; &quot;908 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. SUMMARY OF ACCIDENTS. PERSONS KILLED-CAUSES.

CLAIRSVILLE AND NORTHERN RAILWAY. 1413 July 7, 1882, when the trustees deemed it advisable to discontinue the operations of the same until a lease could be procured. April 17, 1882, the trustess leased said railway, with all its franchises, and property of every kind and description, upon the terms and conditions provided by the Council of said village, for a period of thirty years, to the St. Clairsville Company, duly in- corporated according to the laws of the State of Ohio, a copy of which lease is here- with furnished by the secretary of said company, to which reference is here made. The road was built and is owned by the village of St. Clairsville, and the funds neces- sary for the purpose were obtained from the sale of the bond aforesaid, aggregating the sum of $30,000, and the further sum, of $5,415, received from the trustees of Rich- land township, in which said village is situated. This last named sum was the pro- ceeds of the sale of said township&apos;s share in the stock formerly held by Belmont county in the Central Ohio Railroad as reorganized. The distribution of said stock among the several townships of said county by the County Commissioners, and the sale of the same, and the distribution of the proceeds thereof by the Trustees of said township, were made in pursuance of an enabling act of the Legislature of Ohio. And in addition to the above mentioned sums, the Trustees, in the construction of said railway, contracted debts, not now fully ascertained, but amounting to about $2,000, which were provided for in the lease aforesaid. The said railway has been opened for general traffic, under the management of the lessees, since June 15, 1882, and by an arrangement made with the C. T. V. &amp;amp; W. R&apos;y Company, now run their trains daily from St. Clairsville through to the Ohio River at Bridgeport, a distance of twelve miles. On the 12th day of December, 1881, Henry C. Welday, and on the 27th day of June, 1882, Joseph R. Mitchell, were appointed members of the Board of Trustees, by the Judge of said Court of Common Pleas, to fill the vacancies occasioned by the resignations of O. J. Swaney and David Darrah.

Bottom chord eye-bars. All wood in these bridges is yellow pine, dressed. Several other bridges on this line are of the same form as the present one; all of which are difficult to describe except by aid of a diagram. The above sketch is, for this reason, given. The members which are shown thin are of iron, while the thicker ones are yellow pine. The panels of the lower chord are all equal. The first two panels are seen to be of the Pratt truss order, while from the end of the second panel we have the Howe form of truss. By this arrangement the second vertical only carries the weight of one panel of the upper chord, or half of two panels. The connections are all pin bearings at the lower chord. The wooden members have cast-iron sockets or terminals at all junctions except along the upper chord; and here at the end. The end post has pin bearings, both ends. The struts have one pin and one square bearing except at the middle panel, where the bearings are cylindric for adjustment. The vertical tie-rods at the top chord go up through and tighten above with a screw nut. Floor-beams, iron, one plate by 30 inches; four angles, 3 by 4 by 9-16, and cover-plates, by 12 inches, reaching 18 inches outside of strings. Vertical cross-stiff- eners on webs of floor-beams. The floor-beams are of constant depth for the length of the cover-plates about 10 feet. From the end of the bottom cover-plate the beam is leveled off to about one-half the depth of the hanger. Hangers, two, 18-inch, inverted U&apos;s on yokes. Pins, end, 4 inches; others, 34 inches. Ties, 6 by 8 inches on edge, 8 inches between; length, 8 feet.

The upper chords and end posts are all thoroughly covered with cor- rugated iron and painted with reddish-brown mineral paint. All parts of the trusses painted, the wooden members with mineral paint. Width, 15 feet. This appears to be a good and thorough built bridge, though the quality of the iron cannot be judged of without tests, which cannot be made while the parts are in the structure. The cast-iron blocks and sockets forming terminals to the wooden members are not in the direction of modern progress from cast-iron toward steel.

X. THE CONNOTTON VALLEY RAILWAY.¹ With a judgment based on a personal inspection of the then com- pleted portion of this road, I pronounced it last year one of the best roads of recent construction that had come under my observation in the State. An inspection made on July 31st, August 1st and 2d, of the road as now opened to traffic, from Cleveland through Canton to Sher- rodsville, in the southern part of Carroll county, and about five miles from Bowerstown, a station on the Pan Handle Railroad, gave me no cause to depart from my judgment of last year concerning the Conot- ton Valley Narrow Gauge Railroad. It is a well built road absolutely, and when the natural difficulties of soil encountered on some portions of the road are taken into consideration, the excellent methods adopted to overcome and neutralize them merit attention and commendation. Embankments are originally well built up with sufficient width on top, not only to hold ballast, but to leave room two to three feet wide between the foot of the ballast slope and the outer slope of the bank. Ditches are evidently well looked after, since in but very few in- stances were they found filled with sliding earth from side cuts. The general appearance of this feature of the right of way and road-bed was clean, and gave proof of receiving careful attention from the road- master. Introduction.

The east approach is one arch of 34 feet span. The west approach consists of 17 arches, each 34 feet span. The spring of the arch at the river is 9 feet above ground; at the hill 3 feet. The base of the piers near the river is 7 by 17 feet, and the height varies from 25 to 30 feet. The river piers have never been injured by ice, and they are in good condition. The panels are not long, but the spans are; hence, the structure must be made of heavier timber than that usually required; and it is so constructed. There are sway braces in each alternate panel, 5 by 8 inches, and the irons are proportionally strong. Bridge in first rate condition. Howe deck; 12 panels, 10 feet each; total 125 feet long. The lower chord has four pieces, 7, 8, 8 and 7 inches wide, 15 inches deep; the upper is smaller by the usual amount. End main braces, 10 by 12, very heavy for so short a structure.

The ties run 2640 to a mile; there is the usual stub switch every place. The fences crowd the track; the ballast is good; so is the align- ment, but the surfacing is only moderate. The ditches are not yet cleaned out, but this makes small difference, the road being steep, and the water runs off quickly. The cuts and embankments are nearly all well sodded; in fine, the road is in very good condition, in August, 1882. 3. Cincinnati, Richmond and Chicago, from 3 miles north of Ham- ilton to Richmond.

It may be inferred from this that grain alone stands next in quantity. Lumber and forest products are third in rank, and in tonnage were 3,611,938 tons, or 7.4 per cent. of the commerce of the State. &quot; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 369 will rise above, and pass over upon the top of the main line rail and finally drop upon it, when the flange drops into the groove near the main rail. Thus a wheel off the track between the main line rails is readily put back and re-railed if it does not get farther from its rail than the half-gauge distance. At the outside the other wheel is brought up to the outside incline, and its flange raised to the level of the main line rail by that incline, when the parallelogram of rails crowd it over into place, both wheels being thus returned. A cross section at the crossing line is shown in the second cut, the two together serv- ing more fully to make the construction clear. outer rail. The elevation of the outer rail on curves is here made equal the Elevation of versed sine of a chord of 45 feet length. This is regarded as a suitable mean between the standard speed, 30 miles per hour, of passenger trains, and the 15 miles per hour of freight trains. The standard flooring for bridges consists of ties, which are 6 by 9 Flooring. inches, and laid 12 inches, center to center, where the bridge has a straight track, but for a curved track the ties are 7 by 9 inches, and beveled, or notched at one string to give the cant. Also guard rails at ends of ties, about 5 by 6 inches, lying flat, notched on ties, and bolted at frequent intervals. Placed about 12 inches out from the track rails. If these figures vary a little in a particular case, the flooring is regarded as about equivalent to standard. The heaviest locomotives in use here are the consolidation of about Locomotives. 80 tons weight, including tenders, when standing on track ready for service. See statement of locomotives. The mile posts and half-mile posts are stone, with figures cut for Mile-posts. miles, etc. Also -mile posts are set. The roadway is all in fine con- dition. The smoothness with which the train is carried, indicates close attention to ballast tamping, rail joint fastenings, and matters belong- ing to section men. Baker Car Warmer. The Baker Car Warmer is now put on all new cars as made. This consists in the main of a boiler or heater, with fire and water com- partments, from the latter of which pipes go to remote parts of the car. To lessen the danger of freezing, when standing by, or steam when heating, the water has a quantity of common salt in solution, which lowers the freezing point, and raises the boiling point. In case of accident the heater is expected to give but little danger of fire, from the fact that the fire is surrounded by water, and will be likely to be extinguished if the heater should become broken or smashed. The structures of the road are for the most part in an exceedingly Iron struc- fine condition. The great number of new iron bridges are all first class, and up to the modern heavy rolling loads. Many of these bridges are of exceedingly novel design, and appear to be the very embodiment of strength and solidity. They are a credit, not only to the road and its chief engineer, who accepted them, but to their accomplished bridge engineer and designer, Gustav Lindenthal, of Pittsburg. 24 tures. &quot; &quot;798 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

The masonry is first class, and of such a height as to set the bridge about 12 feet above low-water mark. The work is all of the very best quality. Between Morrow and Xenia are 24 short bridges, from 15 to 30 feet long, and all are either plate girders or I-beams, and are all very firm and secure, and are usually from 3 to 5 feet high. The first one north of Cesar&apos;s creek bridge is 17 feet long. The plate is 2 feet deep and inch thick, and is re-enforced by double angle irons at top and bottom inch thick, and having one branch 3 inches, the other 4 inches wide. The floors are ties 8 by 6 inches, at intervals of 8 inches; the ribbons are 8 by 6 inches, well bolted. No better short spans can be found. The track itself from Cincinnati to Columbus is in excellent condition -parts of it as good as can be made. The fencing and ditches are also as they should be. 5.

From Xenia to West Jefferson there are some short spans for roads or cattle passes, but nothing requiring attention. They are all strong and durable; the abutments are, in all cases, stone, of good construc- tion. Howe Truss of 12 panels, each 10 1-5 feet; breadth, 14 feet in the clear; and height, 20 feet clear.

All these struc- tures are in good preservation. The structures, part trestle and part bridge, numbered from 7 to 13, inclusive, and situated between Independence and Peninsula Station, are in style of construction like those just described, ranging in length from 12 to 125 feet. Nos. 7, 11, and 13 are single span, over small water courses. A portion of No. 9 is now being filled up. The long span in this measures 36 feet, and has three 10 by 16-inch track stringers, trussed with four 14-inch rods. In other respects it is like No. 4. In No. 10 there is one long span, measuring 24 feet, which has a double 8 by 16-inch trussed beam for a track stringer, truss rods being double, 2 inches in diameter. No. 12 has three 14-foot spans, and single 12 by 12-inch stringers under each rail. Nos. 7 to 13. No. 14, about one-half mile north of Peninsula Station, is a trestle No. 14. Penin- sula Flats. over Peninsula Flats, containing twenty-five spans, of 16 feet each. The bents are double braced transversely by X-braces, and also longi- tudinally by four courses of horizontal 6 by 8-inch pieces, extending from end to end of the structure. The trestle has &quot;boxed&quot; vertical and batter posts, and differs in style of construction from that usually adopted for works of its kind. I found its like on only one other road in Ohio. A diagram would be necessary to make a description of it plainly intelligible. The principle adopted being to use for posts, sills, and caps a number of pieces of small dimensions, the sum of whose areas of cross section is generally equal to the cross section of like members in ordinary structures. For example, in the trestle under consideration, the ground sill consists of three pieces, two being 3 by 8 inches, and one 6 by 8 inches in section; the posts also are in two pieces, each 6 by 8 inches, as also are the caps. All these are securely fastened together, and to each other by means of numerous iron bolts. Intermediate inclined struts extend from the middle of the vertical posts to a suspended cap, half way between bents, thus affording points of support at intervals of less than 8 feet to the track stringers. The foot of this inclined strut rests in an iron casting, made especially for this purpose. The advantages claimed for this class of structures are greater strength for quantity of material used, less liability to decay, hence greater durability, and in case of decay or deterioration of any part, greater facility for replacing or repairing the part defective. A disadvantage, that would occur to me, would be want of stiffness, and, on account of the great number of bolts and joints necessary, a liabil- ity to get out of adjustment and repair. The bents are securely braced, transversely and longitudinally. The track stringers are double under each rail, ties 4 by 8 inches, and only 4 inches apart, with a 6 by 8-- inch wooden guard rail bolted to them. Some of the sills and timbers. in this work which were beginning to show signs of decay, have been renewed within the year. &apos; &quot;76 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. Ballast. the upper, 6 by 6 inches. The center counter-braces are 9 by 10 inches; the center mains, 7 by 9 inches. The rods vary from 18 to 2 inches. The whole structure is new and very good. At each end of the bridge is a trussed girder 30 feet long. The ballast on this branch of the line is moderately good; the road- way is in a passably fair condition. All the branch lines which I have examined, show a less degree of completeness than the main lines, and the reason is not far to seek. The line from Dresden to New Lexington has little fencing except what seems to belong to the farmers; from New Lexington on, it is fenced irregularly, and the right of way in fair condition, considering the season.

CORPORATE HISTORY. June 17, 1879 (R. S., page 2069), an act was passed by the Legislature of Ohio, authorizing any incorporated village, which, by the federal census of 1870 had a pop- ulation of 1,056, to build railroads, and to lease or operate the same on certain con- ditions therein named, the said act having special relation to the village of St. Clairsville. The council thereof, by resolution, declared it to be essential to the in- terest of said village that a line of railway, to be known as &amp;quot;The St. Clairsville and Northern Railway,&amp;quot; should be constructed between the said village and some point on the Cleveland, Tuscarawas Valley and Wheeling Railway, not exceeding five miles in length; and in pursuance of said act ordered the submission of the question of providing such line of railway to the qualified voters of the said village, at a special election to be held on the 12th of July, 1879, which election so held resulted in 208 ballots being cast in favor of and 12 against building the road. Thereupon, such proceedings were had in the premises that the Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Belmont county, Ohio, in the vacation after the summer term, 1879, thereof, appointed Thomas E. Clark, Hiram Boroff, O. J. Swaney, David Darrah, and C. W. Carroll as Trustees of said proposed railway; and on the 23d day of September, 1879, said Trustees were duly qualified and organized as a board by the election of Thomas E. Clark, President; Hiram Boroff, Treasurer; and C. W. Carroll, Secretary. Subse- quently, the Trustees located said railway in the valley of a stream known as Woods or Town Run, from a point within said village to a point on the C. T. V. &amp;amp; W. R&apos;y, a distance of 3 miles, and fixed the gauge of the same at 3 feet; and for the purpose of providing funds for the construction of the road, issued bonds in the name of said village, aggregating $30,000, which were duly sold at their par value. The said bonds were secured by a mortgage on the line of said railway, and by the pledge of the faith of said village. On the 6th day of July, 1880, the work of construction began, and continued without interruption until the day of, 1881, when the railway was nearly completed as a narrow gauge road, and a full complement of rolling stock ob- tained. At this juncture the Trustees determined to change the gauge of the road to a standard gauge (from 3 feet to 4 feet 8 inches), which was accordingly done, and the equipment exchanged to conform to the altered condition of the road. November 14, 1881, the road was opened for general traffic, and so continued until &quot; &quot;NORTH WESTERN OHIO RAILWAY. 1277 RATES OF TRANSPORTATION. PASSENGERS. Highest.

Additional facilities for docks and sufficient terri- tory for all possible future requirements of an extended trade at this place were pointed out as being under the ownership and control of the railroad. Buildings for repair shops, round houses, etc., are also located at Norwalk, some completed, others in process of construction, but none yet furnished with machinery. Near Clarksfield, on the Vermillion river, a stone quarry has been opened, and is already largely developed. It furnishes a quality of stone, resembling, I am informed, in many respects, the Berea stone. A short branch line extends from the main road to the quarry. From Orrville on southeastward to Massillon and beyond the road begins to penetrate the coal-producing regions, and here and there short branch lines are already extending out like feelers for this great source of revenue to a railroad. A number of mines contributing their produc- tion to it as a carrier are already furnishing reliable daily quantities, and in sight of the railroad others are being opened and developed. The controlling relation of this line with the Cleveland and Marrietta road, together with its direct outlet to Cleveland via the Valley Rail- way, from Valley Junction, gives it peculiarly excellent facilities for overcoming the great disadvantages which have heretofore borne so heavily upon the Cleveland and Marietta line by reason of its want of an outlet for the productions of the Cambridge, Byersville, and other coal mines along its route. All these facts and relations being taken into consideration, there seems good reason to believe that this road will, in the course of the expansion of the various enterprises along its line, which in many cases owe their existence to its presence, receive sufficient revenue to justify the judgment of its projectors in locating it. Its entrance into the city of Toledo is by a winding course along the bank of an abandoned portion of a canal bed. Its terminus, and passenger and freight station is located on Cherry street, well in the city. The passenger depot is in a substantial and tasteful brick build- ing, which contains in its upper story two general offices of the road. The longest bridges on this road are the arrangement of trestle approaches to the combination truss bridges and the iron draw-bridge over the Maumee river, at Toledo. These bridges were built by the Clinton Bridge Company, and they are owned by the Wheeling and Lake Erie Bridge Company, a corporation separate from the W. &amp;amp; L. E. R&apos;y Co. The western approach is a 240-foot pile trestle, then come seven spans combination Pratt truss bridge, each span 180 feet long. These rest on stone masonry piers, supported on pile foundations. In each span are eleven panels, each 16 feet 1-inch long, and 27 feet deep. The floor beams are 30-inch plate girders, 4-inch web, and 34 inch angle iron flanges. The track stringers are three pieces, 6 by 16 inches, and an end bearer under end of ties. The ties are 6 by 8 inches, 8 &quot; &quot;1458 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

The length of the road from Marion, Ohio, its eastern terminus, to Hammond, its western terminus, is 249 miles. The road is still is process of construction, and in the possession of the contractors, and no portion of the same has been entirely completed. On the 1st day of Septem- ber, 1882, the Chief Engineer of the Company reports &amp;quot;ninety per cent. of the entire grading of the road is done. One hundred and nineteen miles of the track has been laid, and thirty-four miles of the track fenced.&amp;quot; Of this, fifty (50) miles of the track have been laid in Ohio. The contract for fencing the entire line has been let, and work on the same is being pushed rapidly. Very little of this work has been done in Ohio. Ballasting of the track has been commenced at Marion, Ohio, and various other points on the line of the road. All the bridges are in process of rapid construc- tion. Contracts for the erection of machine shops at Huntington, Indiana, and round-house and turn-tables at Marion, Ohio, have been made, and a large amount of preliminary work done on each. The Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad Company, over whose line this Com- pany&apos;s road enters Chicago, has completed its track to its western terminus at Ham- mond, Indiana. It is the expressed intention of the contractors to turn the road over to the company for operation as early as December of the present year, and there is no doubt the road will be in full operation on or before January 1, 1883. The unfin- ished condition of the road renders it impossible to make use of the blanks for- warded by the Commissioner, and I have therefore endeavored briefly to give a gen- eral statement showing the progress the company has inade in the construction of its road, and its present situation. Should any further information be required on the subject, it will be promptly given. Respectfully yours, SAMUEL B. SMITH, President C. &amp;amp; A. Railway.

Several of these bridges have continuous lower chord pieces, which are 65 feet long, without joints. They are now all covered, each truss being boarded in and roofed over separ- ately, and in such manner as to admit of access to and examination of all its parts. The bridge over Raccoon creek at Vinton is a through Howe truss of 14 panels, each 10 feet 3 inches long, and 23 feet deep. It rests on stone masonry abutments. Its lower chords are 7, 7, 7, 6 by 15 inches, and upper, 7, 7, 7, 6 by 13 inches. Main braces, 9 by 11 inches to 9 by 7 inches. Counters, 9 by 9 inches to 9 by 7 inches. Tie rods in sets of three throughout, and from 2 inches at ends to 19 inches diam- eter at center. Floor beams, 6 by 12 inches, five per panel. Ties, 6 by 8 inches, and 9 inches apart. The lower chords of this bridge are a combination of oak and pine. One of these has given indications of yielding recently, and is now being replaced by a new piece of timber. The bridge is further being strengthened by the addition of two sub- stantial trestle supports under the second panel point from each end, thus reducing its clear span to about 110 feet. It is approached from the north by 17 spans of strong trestle work. At Campaign creek, crossing near Kerr&apos;s Station, there is a low Howe Trestles. truss bridge, containing 10 panels, each 7 feet long and 10 feet deep. Lower chord, 6, 8, 6 by 13 inches; upper, 6, 8, 6 by 11 inches. Main braces, from 8 by 9 inches to 8 by 6 inches. Counters, 6 by 7 inches throughout. Tie rods, in sets of two, and from 2 inches diameter at ends to 1 inches at center. Floor beams, 7 by 14 inches, three per panel. Its abutments are pile bents. There are also Howe truss bridges similar in style and size of princi- pal members to those of the same length already described; one 60 feet long, over Kygher creek, near Cheshire, and one over Leading creek, near Middleport. The truss bridges on the road from Logan are all new, and, with the exception of the one at Vinton, have not been changed since last year, except to be covered, as already stated, and in two instances raised to accommodate changes of grade and improvements of road-bed. There are about two hundred separate trestles on this road from Logan to Pomeroy, varying in length from one or two spans of 14 feet each to thirty spans and in height from less than 6 to as much as 60 feet. These are provided with guard rails, usually 6 by 4 inches. The ties, as a rule, are 6 by 8 inches, and from 8 to 10 inches apart. Stringers, 14 by 14 inches when single, or 7 by 14 inches when double, with a 6 by 14 inch single stringer under end of ties. Spans, 14 feet from center to center of bents.

The first two miles from Portsmouth are not ballasted; the next four miles the track is about half ballasted with slag. Track quite rough for four miles, but is improved over last year. Total length, 100 feet. In the center is a trussed girder 30 feet long, having a single 2-inch rod on each side. There are heavy 8 by 9-inch ribbons, properly placed. Howe Truss. Two spans, each 100 feet, having each 9 panels of 11 feet length. The masonry is first class, and the bridge is sound, al- though it has been built 30 years. Bridge covered. The floor has ties 5 by 8 inches, at intervals of 10 inches. The floor-beams are 7 by 13 inches, and 4 to a panel; the track-stringers are 10 by 10 inches. The lower chord has four pieces, 13 inches deep, and two are 5 inches, and the other two 6 inches broad. The vertical rods are in pairs, and all are 1 inches in diameter. The main braces are all 7 by 10, and the counters 7 by 7 inches. The bridge is too light for locomotives of weight, such as is now customary. The west approach is 200 feet long, 40 feet high; of the usual form, but without braces; the ribbons are good, 8 by 8 inches; timber notched on the ties. The east approach is like the west in general; is 400 feet long, and two years old. Another, 300 feet long; the foundation all wood. It is about 25 feet above ground, and strong enough. Is 140 feet long, and is, in all respects, like those before named in span and timbers, sufficiently strong; is 20 feet high. One hundred and forty feet long with two trussed girders, 30 feet each, near the middle, having two 2-inch rods on each side. Height about 20 feet. For some distance, in this vicinity, the track is over- grown with clover, and would be good as pasture. One hundred feet long, 15 feet high, with one trussed girder in the center. At this point there is no ballast for a mile or two. The chairs are all old-fashioned, and, of course, bad; the ties, in many places, are old and decayed. Three bents and one trussed girder of the usual form; 12 feet high. Three 30 foot trussed girders, 6 feet high; all good. One short.span of 15 feet, and one trussed girder, 30 feet long, 6 or 8 feet high. Two 30 foot trussed girders, and one span of 15 feet, all 6 or 8 feet high. Like 15 in all respects. Like 15 also, except the girders are 5 feet shorter. One span, 15 feet; one 25 foot girder, having a single rod on each side; and one 30 foot trussed girder, with double rods. &quot; &apos;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. IX. COLLEGE HILL RAILROAD-NARROW GAUGE.¹ The track is not well ballasted; is very steep in places. only on the road. Half Howe deck of 7 panels, 7 feet each; lower chord, single piece, Two trestles 11 by 13 inches; the upper, 9 by 13 inches; corbels, 5 feet long, are used in the trestles; the braces in the bridge are 4 by 6 inches; the No. 1. west approach is 127 feet long; in the longest part, longitudinal braces are used; the east approach is 355 feet long, with spans of 15 feet; highest point, 28 feet. The work is all much decayed, and the timber is partly on the ground for renewal. Length, 188 feet; flooring is 6 by 8, and is bunched very greatly. No. 2, trestle. One bay is 27 feet, having stringers, 14 by 16 inches; re-enforced by a straining beam, 9 feet long, and 5 by 10 inches. Bays in general, 15 feet. For 1882 the following remarks were written down during the ex- amination of the road. It may not be amiss to say that for some cause or other, the authorities of the road were excited to good deeds. The road has been greatly improved since the last report. The track is more even, the ballast has been increased in many places, the align- ment is fair all through, the surfacing is as good as can be reasonably expected of short, non-paying roads. The trestles. The trestles mentioned last year as dangerous, have both been strengthened and rendered safe for another year, the flooring and rib- bons having been well adjusted or renewed. There are two or three very sharp curves, which should be passed over very carefully. The ditches are well open; the cuts, with two exceptions, are in Ditches, cuts, good condition; the embankments are of sufficient width; and travel on the road is safe as long as the locomotive engineers attend to their duty. etc. Summary of Finances and Business,¹ Mileage 6 Capital stock.. $112,500 00 Funded debt 60,000 00 $18,750 00 per mile. 10,000 00 66 Total stock and debt (unfunded, $307.06)... 172,807 06 28,801 17 66 Cost of road and equipment. 59,500 00 9,750 00 66 Tax valuation.. 11,196 00 1,866 00 66 Gross earnings.. 9,700 80 1,616 80 64 Net earnings.......…………….. 4,785 05 797 50 46 To stock and debt.

THE CLEVELAND, COLUMBUS, CINCINNATI AND INDIANAPOLIS RAILWAY,¹ from Cleveland to Dayton via Delaware and Spring- field, and from Union City, Ind., to Galion, Ohio. This line is one of the standard roads of the State in its equipment and appointments. The entire line, with the exception of a portion of the distance from Delaware to Columbus, is laid with steel rail. The great advantage of its situation, its terminal points at Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis, with the intermediate towns of Union City, Dayton, Springfield, Delaware, and Columbus, entitle it to the claim of reaching every important city and town in the center of the State, as well as those at its termini. At Cleveland it has all the ad- vantage over other roads of priority of location, and hence choice of territory for terminal facilities, transfer tracks, and yards. The same is apparent at Columbus. The principal repair and construction shops are now at Delaware. Shops on a smaller scale are at Galion and Cleveland.

Has 8 bents, is 8 feet, and is of oak, and very good. Has 12 bents, 16 feet each; is 25 feet at highest point. It has one 30-foot trussed girder, with a single rod 13 inches on each side, 15 inches below chord. The stringers are double, 7 by 15 inches, and the floor is close. Has 19 panels of 16 feet, each, from 12 to 20 feet; of oak, and the floor close. Twenty-five panels; total length, 500 feet; at highest point 40 feet above ground. There is one trussed girder, 40 feet long, and 45 feet high; double 1-inch rods on each side, dropping 23 feet below stringer; floor, close. There are four longitudinal braces; all the high parts are double braced; timbers, oak, and all good, except they want guard rails. In the six miles of new road east of Bethel are two trestles, one 100 feet long, the other 60. The frame timber is 12 inches square; the caps, 7 feet long; the flooring is open, covering only half the space; the ties are 6 feet long, 61 to 7 inches wide, 6 inches thick, and 2,600 to the mile. The road is in all essential respects like the Cincinnati and Eastern, and reference is here made to the remarks above on that road. Sev- eral hundred feet of the trestle near Columbia were carried off by the flood in 1882. On each side of the bridge over the Little Miami, there is a long line of pile trestle, firmly braced, and in good condition, ex- cept the flooring is open, the ties being at least a foot apart on the average. In case of derailment there would be disaster. There are a few sharp curves as the road climbs up out of the valley, but care will keep off all danger. In the narrow gauge roads which I have examined, there has been a very general improvement over last year. It is well known that the broader the gauge the steadier the cars. It is impossible to make a narrow gauge as steady as a standard gauge. The same amount of displacement in the narrow nearly doubles the vibration, and, conse- quently, the pounding of the cars will act more disastrously than on the wider kinds. The switches are of the kind usually called &quot;stub&quot;-not only on . this road, but also on the other narrow lines the same kind is used. &apos; &apos;224 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. The ties and wooden guard rail are as usual for the standard flooring. The stringers are in two parts of 4 by 12 inches, lying flat, one on the other with the galvanized iron roof covering between, as plainly shown, and bolts go through them and the floor beams. The floor Steel rails. beam ends are beveled off, and the 1-inch boarding is nailed upon them as rafters. Between the stringer pieces as much crowning as desired are nailed upon the floor beams to carry the 1-inch r of board- ing. On these boards cleats or battens are nailed at such distance apart as suited to the width of the galvanized iron roofing, and run- ning down the roof boards. The strut iron is bent up at both edges so as to just lie in the space between battens, as shown in the second figure. A narrow strip, a little wider than the battens, is bent down at both edges and placed over the turned up edges of the broader struts and the battens also. Nails are then driven through both kinds of struts at the bent edges and down through the battens into the roof boards, as is plainly shown in the second sketch. The upper halves of the stringers are notched on the under side at the battens, an excess being cut away to allow room for the water to flow out from between the stringers. By placing the anchor bolts of the stringers through the battens where the holes made through the sheet iron is on top of the batten strip of iron, it is plain that water will be most effectually kept out from below. The sides of the bridge are boarded up in the usual way. There seems to be no good reason why a bridge might not remain sound thirty years when protected with a roof of this kind, and side boarding 2 inches off from the trusses and ventilated, with a space of 3 or 4 inches under the eaves, shielded by a vertical board along at the edge of the eaves. All steel rails are 60 pounds per yard, and of one form of section, adopted as standard. Accepted lengths are 30, 29, and 28 feet, and none less than 26 feet. The differing lengths facilitate the alternate joints on curves, as insisted on by this road, as well as on tangents. The standard section is a good one for holding fish plates, but the sides of the heads do not slope toward the angle of the wheel flanges as much as the average rail section in use, and much less than the so- called Chanute head. Sections sketched from new standard steel rails on cars in transit, give the following measurements, viz.: On a hori- zontal line across the head, and 5-16 inch from the top, the width is 2 inches. At an inch down, the width is 2 inches. The &quot; stem&quot; of the rail is inch thick, with the sides slightly concave. The under- side of the head is sloped to about the same angle as the foot or bot- tom flanges. Width of bottom flanges, 4 inches; extreme depth of &apos; &quot;ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS. 375 L., 35x104; L., 15x38; L., 65x119; L., 56x241; L., 65x96; L., 14x65.

The other bridges mentioned, namely, Nos. 52, 51, and 50, differ from the above in that they have 12 panels, and that the dimensions of tim- bers and tie rods in the end panel are a little heavier than in the last panels of No. 53. No. 46 is one of the high trestles between Danville and Gann. It is nearly filled up, and in a few weeks two askew stone masonry arches, one for a county road and the other for water course, will be all that remains of a trestle which was, last year, 500 feet long, and more than 40 feet high at its maximum. No. 45, the second of the high trestles, has new stringers, partly new ties, and new timbers throughout in the upper tier of braces, plumb and batter posts. No. 44 is a two-span Howe truss bridge, over Mohican creek at Gann. It is entirely new. Each span contains 16 panels, 10 feet 1 inches &quot; &apos;286 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS.

All the above bridges numbered from 53 to 84, inclusive, are of the class known as the combination-that is, the compression members are wood (pine in the present case), and the tension members wrought iron. Also the floor beams and stringers are wood. The wooden parts of the trusses are all painted with what appears to be the so-called min- eral paint of a brownish red color. The wooden parts are not covered. The iron parts have pin connections, and the wooden struts terminate in iron fittings with pin holes. Where several wooden pieces combine in one member they are stayed at an intervening space of about an inch. They are generally through bridges. In the above all on masonry, and everything apparently in excellent condition. These combination bridges were all made by the Smith Bridge Company, of Toledo, O., after well matured designs, and of good work- manship. The maximum live load assumed in figuring these bridges, is stated, by the Smith Bridge Company, to have been 2,600 pounds per foot. General Remarks. &quot; The engineering work of this road north of Uhrichsville is very dif- ferent in appearance from that south of that place.

(except in the total mileage). They are due to the following: In Table II. there are 55.87 miles of the Dayton and Western and Columbus and Xenia classed as branches of the Little Miami, which are put down in this table as main line; also, in this table are 15.51 miles of C. S. &amp;amp; C. classed as branches, which are included in the main line of I. B. &amp;amp; W.; these make a difference of 40.36 miles, which, added to 367.516,407.876, same as in Table II. The 15.51 miles of C. S. &amp;amp; C. should properly be classed as a branch of I. B. &amp;amp; W.-this would make the branches-423.386, and main track, 5,768.909. The difference in the total single track and double track is due to the Cincinnati Northern Railway Company reporting 5 miles of double track and 35.1 miles of single track; whereas, in Table II. it is put down 37.6 miles of single track and 2.50 miles of double track-the usual method of reporting; also, in Table II. the College Hill Railroad reports 6 miles of main track and no sidings, while in this table 5.50 miles of main track with .50 miles of sidings are reported. Pursuing the same method with all the roads, the following would be the results: Single main track, 5,768.409 miles; branches, 423.386: total single track, 6,191.795. Double track, 228.643; sidings, 1,340.043: total, 7,760.481. (a) Cincinnati, Sandusky and Cleveland not reported by counties this year. By using last year&apos;s figures in this table, .09 mile of main track too much are counted. (b) Ohio Southern not reported by counties. Last year&apos;s figures are used-being to small for main track by 5.57 miles, and too large for sidings by .619 mile. (e) Cleveland and Mahoning Valley not reported by counties; last year&apos;s figures used. (d) Eastern Ohio not reported; figures of last year taken. (e) Cincinnati and Baltimore not reported (see g). Cincinnati and White Water Valley Railroad not reported since 1874; figures of that year used. (g) Baltimore Short Line not reported. Figures of last year for this and Cincinnati and Baltimore used, being too small in sidings by 3.45 miles. (h) Connotton Valley not reported sidings by counties. There are 17.32 miles. (i) I. B. &amp;amp; W. did not report mileage by counties. In addition to what is included in Cincinnati, Sandusky and Cleveland, and Columbus, Spring- field and Cincinnati, there are 61.23 miles of single track, no sidings being reported. (j) W. St. L. &amp;amp; P. reports no sidings for this year; last year&apos;s still retained in this table. &quot; &quot;1306 ANNUAL REPORT COMMISSIONER OF RAILROADS, FENCING-AVERAGE AND AGGREGATE COST.

The road-bed, ballast, track and ties on this portion of the road are in very good condition throughout, and in many places even better than on the line from Delaware to Cincinnati. The first important wooden structure going east from Union City is near Versailles. If is a six-span wooden trussed girder; spans are from 23 to 24 feet clear; the girder consists of three pieces of oak tim- bers, 4, 8, 4 by 18 inches, in section trussed with two 14-inch rods. These serve as track stringers. The end or guard rail bearers are single, 6 by 18-inch beams. The girders are supported on good stone masonry piers and abutments, and break joints over corbels, which are borne directly by the wall plates. Ties and guard rails are as usual. The timbers are old, but give no indications of loss of strength from age or decay. Near Houston Station is a two-span Howe truss deck bridge, built in 1877, clear length of each span being 76 feet. It has 8 panels, each 8 feet 6 inches long; height of truss, 13 feet 4 inches. Four sets of sway braces. End main braces, two, 8 by 9 inches; counters, 6 by 6 inches ; end rods, two, 13 inches diameter. In other respects like bridges of its class previously described. Crossing the Miami river at Sidney is a three-span wooden Howe truss deck bridge, whose spans are 71, 156 and 156 feet long, and in the clear, 61, 147 and 147 feet. The long spans are as follows: sixteen panels, each 9 feet 8 inches long; truss, 16.8 feet high; lower chords, 30 by 15 inches, or four pieces, 74 by 15 inches. End main braces, two, 11 by 12 inches; rods, two, 21, and one, 1 inches diameter; counter braces, 8 by 10 inches to 8 by 8 inches; end posts, four, 7 by 12 inches; end tie rods, two, 1 inches diameter; sway braces, five sets, 7 by 9 inches; lower laterals, 6 by 6 inches, with 11-inch rods. The floor system is the usual one on this road. By comparison with many other bridges of this length of span I find the dimensions here given larger than is usual. The oldest portion of this bridge was built in 1877, the last in 1879. There was found in this one broken angle iron. All parts were found well preserved. Road-bed.
