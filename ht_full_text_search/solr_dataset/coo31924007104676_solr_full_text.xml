It was not necessary to wait until the commissioners had put the law in full operation, and its effects upon the railway company had become complete, before the application against them was made to a court of equity. A very important function of that court is to prevent threatened wrongs to the rights of property. * * 2. We are of opinion that the act of the 11th of March, mentioned above, was not repealed by the act of the 12th of March, 1874, the second section of which declares &quot;all existing corporations within this state shall have and possess all the powers and privileges contained * in their respective charters;&quot; and the act of the 12th of March, 1874, the ninth section of which imposes a penalty for exorbitant charges. There are apparent inconsistencies between these last two named acts and that of the 11th of March; but it be- comes a question of intendment on the part of the legislature. And on the same day a joint resolution was passed (March 12th) directing the secretary of state not to publish the act of the 11th of March until the 28th of April, (acts of 1874, pages 599, 693, 758, 773). In this state no general law is in force till after publication. We think we may consider the joint resolution, in or- der to determine whether the legislature intended that two acts passed on the same day should repeal the act of the 11th of March, and from that it is man- ifest such was not the intention of the legislature. 3. The charters of the railroad corporations under the constitution of Wis- consin &quot;may be altered or repealed by the legislature at any time after their passage.&quot; In legal effect, therefore, there was incorporated in all the numer- ous grants under which the Northwestern Railway Company now claims its rights of franchise and property in this state, the foregoing conditions, con- tained in the constitution. It became a part, by operation of law, of every contract or mortgage made by the company, or by any of its numerous pred- ecessors, under which it claims. All share and bondholders took their stock or their securities subject to this paramount condition, and of which they, in law, had notice. If the corporation, by making a contract or deed of trust on its property, could clothe its creditors with an absolute, unchangeable right, it would enable the corporation, by its own act, to abrogate one of the provisions of the fundamental law of the state. 4. This principle is not changed by authority from the legislature of the state to a corporation to consolidate with a corporation of another state. The corporation of this state is still subject to the constitution of Wisconsin, and there is no power anywhere to remove it beyond the reach of its authority. 5. As to the rates for the transit of persons and property exclusively within the limits of this state, the legislature had the right to alter the terms of the charter of the Northwestern Railway Company, and the fact that such alter- ation might affect the value of its property or franchises, cannot touch the question of power in the legislature. The repeal of its franchises would have well nigh destroyed the value of its tangible property; and while the latter, as such, could not be taken, still, its essential value for use on the railroad would be gone. 6. The fact that grants of land were made by congress to the state cannot change the rights of the corporators or of the creditors. If the state has not performed the trust it must answer to the United States. 7. The act of the 11th of March, 1874, while not interfering with the rates of freight on property transported entirely through the state to and from other states, includes within its terms property and persons transported on railroads from other states into Wisconsin, from Wisconsin into other states. This act either establishes or authorizes the commissioners to establish fixed rates of freight and fare on such persons and property, The case of &quot;The State Freight Tax,&quot; reported in the 15th Wallace, p. 232, decides that this last described traffic constitutes &quot;commerce between the several states,&quot; and that the regulation thereof belongs exclusively to congress. It becomes, therefore, a very grave question whether it is competent for a state arbitrarily to fix certain rates for the transportation of persons and property of this inter- state commerce, as the right to lower rates implies also the right to raise them. There may be serious doubts whether this can be done. This point was not fully argued by the counsel, and scarcely at all by the counsel of the defendants; and, under the circumstances, we do not at present feel war- ranted, on this ground alone, to order the issue of an injunction.

The commissioners, after years of investigation, report adversely on the proposition to regulate charges for transportation, unless it be of passengers, and in favor of mixed ownership by the state, as will appear further on in this report. 3. The railway controversy in other New England states. In all the New England states there has been considerable agita- tion of transportation questions, and in Connecticut, New Hamp- shire and Vermont, the &quot;commissioner system,&quot; so called, has been in use for some time. 4. The railway question in Pennsylvania. The state of Pennsylvania has a system of partial supervision of railways, amounting, at present, to but little more than requiring annual reports to be made to the state auditor. The whole subject is considerably agitated just now, however, the prospect being that a policy of control, as to rates, may soon be adopted. 5. The problem in Ohio. Ohio did not fairly commence the work of inquiry into matters of railway management until 1867. In that year a law was passed providing for the appointment of one railroad commissioner, with authority to inspect the roads and require them to be kept in a safe condition, to make investigation into the grounds of complaints made of railroad companies, and to report all real grievances to the governor for the information of the legislature; also to require re- ports from all railroad and telegraph companies, to attend to the enforcement of all laws relating to railroad and telegraph matters when the same are brought to his notice, and finally to report the condition and working of the several railroads within the state. By an act of 1873, the railway companies not protected by special charter privileges, as well as all companies thereafter in- corporated, are limited as to rates of charges. The latest reports of the commissioner indicate that the railroad &apos; &quot;14 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

THE COMMISSIONERS TO SUPERINTENDENT SWAN. OFFICE OF RAILROAD COMMISSONERS, MADISON, May 23, 1874. WM. G. SWAN, Esq., Gen&apos;l. Sup&apos;t. West Wisconsin R. R. DEAR SIR: :- -Your letter of May 16, is received, without the enclosure of freight rates to which you refer. Please forward the latter by return mail, or as soon as practicable. We thank you for the courteous manner in which you convey to us much information in detail as to the history and condition of your road. We frankly assure you, as far as this commission is concerned, that no disposi- tion exists to discourage railroad enterprise, or to place unreasonable bur- thens upon capital invested in this direction. The interpretation of the law is not left with us, but with the courts, as to many of the questions raised by you. It is our plain duty, however, to investigate facts with a view to the intelligent action of the legislature; and we sincerely believe that when the facts are ascertained and rendered intelligible to the public, there will be found no just cause of complaint on the part of the roads. We regret that until that time the roads do not all feel it a duty to respect the law as it is. The Governor informs us that you are in error as to a remark supposed by you to have been made by him, respecting the West Wisconsin road. Mr. Spooner of your company casually remarked to him that your operating ex- penses ranged between forty and sixty-three per cent., and he simply referred to this expression of opinion.

Section 2, of chapter 292, in which the repeal by that act is claimed, amends sec. 55 of the general Railroad act of 1872. The section amended provides that existing companies shall have all the powers and be subject to all the duties prescribed by that act. The amendment provides that they shall have all the powers of the general Railroad act and of their charters. It seems to us that the intention of the amendment is very manifest; and it is a question of legislative intention. The amendment was probably adopted ex abundanti cautela, to remove any possible doubt that the franchises of the general Act had superseded the franchises of existing charters. And the amendment is not a grant of powers, but a mere confirmation of powers previously granted. It left the companies where it found them. And if chapter 273 be a valid alteration of railroad charters previously existing, it is no more repealed by sec. 2 of chapter 292, than any other previous amendment of such charters The powers of railroad companies confirmed by this section, are those pow ers of their charters, controlled by all amendments of them and other public acts validly affecting them, as they existed when the section was passed. It is not difficult to make chapters 273 and 292 stand together. Chapter 341 is an act in relation to railroads, with many provisions for their general government, perhaps all resting in the police power of the state. Amongst the rest, sec. 9, under which the repeal is claimed, provides a pen- alty against any railroad company taking more than a reasonable rate of com- pensation. It was claimed that this provision licenses a reasonable rate of compensation in all cases, and therefore repeals the maximum rates specific- ally fixed by chapter 273. There are three answers to this: First. Chapter 273 limits the companies to the maximum rates provided, but does not expressly license them to exact those full rates. And it might well happen, and the legislature may have so considered, that rates then rea- sonable, might, in change of circumstances, become unreasonable; and that these companies continuing to charge the full maximum rates might be charg- ing unreasonable rates. Secondly. The act provides no fixed, statutory rates of freight for class C. of roads. This class is forbidden to charge more than in June, 1873, which might be an unreasonable rate. And it includes all railroads not included in classes A. and B., and might therefore well include roads not operated in June, 1873, which would have no limit of rates of freight under the act. Here is ample scope for sec. 9 of ch. 341, without disturbing the fixed rates of ch. 273. Thirdly. Chapter 273 does not assume to fix rates for all traffic on rail- roads. The commissioners might not fix the remaining rates, or might delay in doing so, or might naturally, by inadvertences, omit articles of freight in their classification. Here again is subject for sec. 9 of chap. 341, to act upon, applying the rule of reasonable compensation. It must be admitted that this looks like careless and slovenly legislation. But either of these views is one which we are bound to seek, and which, seek- ing, we readily find, to reconcile the two acts and make them consist together. The question of constructive repeal is one of legislative intent. The three acts were passed within two successive days, and must have been pending to- gether. And it is not possible to believe that the legislature intended to de- feat the operation of chap. 273 by the other acts, going through the forms of legislation contemporaneously with it. And this question of intent seems to us to be absolutely determined by the passage of Joint Resolution No. 11, de- laying the publication of chap. 273, so that it could not become a law until after chapters 292 and 341 had taken effect as laws; so that the constructive repeal should precede, not follow, the act repealed. The resolution and the consequent order of publication of the three acts, seem to us not only to dem- onstrate that the legislature intended no repeal, but might possibly have had the effect, if there must be a repeal, of making chapter 273, as the latter act repeal sec. 2 of chap. 292, and sec. 9 of chap. 341. It was contended by the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp;amp; St. Paul Company that it was not in class A of railroads, because the corporation in that class is called the Milwaukee &amp;amp; St. Paul Company; whereas the defendant had just one month before added the prefix, Chicago, to its name, under a statute authoriz- &quot; &quot;122 Report of Railroad Commissoners.

In ex parte Pritz, 9 Iowa, 30, Davis v. Woodnough, 9 Iowa, 104, and McGregor v. Baylies, 19 Iowa, 44, the supreme court held that, under the clause of their constitution mentioned, the legislature had not power by special act to amend city or town charters, existing by special act at the time of the adop- tion of the constitution. With great respect for that court, we should hesitate long before concurring in the cause in Von Phul v. Hammer, 29 Iowa, 222, that court also held that although the legislature could not amend existing charters, yet every corporation of the kind might amend its own charter, under a power in the general law. But we need not consider the reasoning of the Iowa cases, because we cannot consider them applicable here. There is no equivalent in their constitution for the reserved power in ours, to enter into or control the construction of the clause in question. The constitution of Indiana, of 1851, art. IV, sec. 22, has a similar pro- hibitory clause of special legislation in specified cases, including laws for the punishment of crime and misdemeanors, and a similar provision for general laws uniform throughout the state. And the question came before the supreme court, whether a law, punishing certain misdemeanors, local in its application and not uniform throughout the state, and, therefore, in con- flict with the constitutional provision adopted, but which was in force at the time of the adoption of the constitution, was not repealed by the constitution. But the court held, without difficulty, that the constitutional requirement was prospective, and did not apply to laws passed before its adoption. State v. Barbee, 3 Porter, 358. This is an aid to our construction. We hold the amendment of 1871 to relate to future corporations, and leave existing corporations under the original provision of the constitution; and that, as to the exisiting corporations, the reserved power to alter or repeal emains unimpaired. V. The maximum rates of chapter 273, of 1874, expressly apply to the rail- oads of the defendants. The defendants plead various antecedent charters, with express power to take toll, without express limitation. The exact language differs in different charters, but the substance is, we believe, alike in all; power to exact tolls in the discretion of the company, not essentially different from the power in the general Railroad Act of 1872. And the defendants, thereupon insist that the limitation of those powers. in their charters, by the fixed rates of chapter 273, impairs the obligation of the contract of their charters, and is, therefore, in violation of the provision of the Constitution of the United States, Art. 1, Sec. 10, Sub. 1, which pro- vides that no state shall pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts. The construction and application of the clause by the supreme court of the United States are certain and defined, and are, of course, beyond the recon- sideration of this court. But a brief review of the clause and its construc- tion is not irrelevant to the questions before us. Mr. Madison, Federalist, No. 43, thus explains the policy and objects of this provision: “Bills of attainder, ex post facto laws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts, are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation. The two former are expressly prohibi- ted by declarations prefixed to some of the state constitutions, and all of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of those fundamental charters. Our own experience has taught us, nevertheless, that additional fences against these dangers ought not to be omitted. Very propely, therefore, have the convention added their constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights: and I am much deceived if they have not, in so doing, as faithfully consulted the genuine sentiments as the undoubted interests of their constituents. The sober people of America are weary of the fluctuat- ing policy which has directed the public councils. They have seen, with regret and indignation, that sudden changes and legislative inferences, in cases affecting private rights, become jobs in the hands of enterprising and influential speculators, and snares to the more industrious and less informed part of the community. They have seen, too, that one legislative interference &quot; &quot;Official Papers and Correspondence. 47 4. What regulations govern your employees in regard to crossings of public highways?

The sale was to include land grants, donations and subscriptions. Under this con- tract, $274,000 in first preferred full paid stock at or over par, and $26,000 in common stock at 150 per cent., were issued under the lease, during the year 1865. Before the close of the year 1866 the Prairie du Chien Company availed itself of its option of purchasing the McGregor &amp;amp; Western road in accordance with the terms heretofore specified, and after an advance to the McGregor company of about $500,000 for new construction. In making this purchase, the Prairie du Chien Company became the equitable owner of a land grant of about 2,500,000 acres, donated to aid in building the McGregor West- ern from McGregor to O&apos;Brien county, Iowa-a distance of about 200 miles. [The grant was subsequently resumed by the state and re-granted to the McGregor and Sioux City Railway Construction Co.] The entire length of the Iowa and Minnesota Division from North McGreg. or, Iowa, to St. Paul and Minneapolis, is 220 miles. The length of the Min- nesota portion of the line-from St. Paul and Minneapolis, and from Austin to the Iowa state line, is 148 miles. The original Minnesota charter was granted March 1, 1856, to the &amp;quot; Minneapolis and Cedar Valley Railroad Com- pany.&amp;quot; The name of the company was subsequently changed to &amp;quot;Minnesota Central.&amp;quot; Minnesota loaned its bonds to the company to the amount of $600,000, and work commenced on the main line in 1857; but after the con- struction of about three-fifths of the road-bed, the road was forfeited to the state for non-payment of interest on the bonds, and subsequently went into the hands of a new company upon condition that the road should be com- pleted within a stated time. The work of preparing the road for rails from Minneapolis to Fairbault, 56 miles, was commenced by the new company in August, 1863, and the line was opened for business from Mendota to North- field, September 4, 1865, and from Minneapolis to Fairbault, October 13, 1865. The entire cost of the road, completed and equipped, was estimated at about $3,000,000, or about $1,700,000, besides the cash value of land granted. The charter of the &amp;quot;Minnesota Central&amp;quot; Company was amended March 9, 1867, and the chartered line of the road now runs trom Red Wing via Fairbault to the south-west part of the state of Minnesota. It has the right to build a branch from Red Wing via Rochester to the south line of the state, to bridge and ferry the Mississippi river at Red Wing; also to consolidate with the Can- non River Improvement Company, which has the right to build a railroad from Red Wing via Fairbault and Waterville to Mankato, and to receive therefor 300,000 acres of swamp land. Land was granted to the Minnesota Central. company to the amount of 171,000 acres, and the company had received but 1,000 acres of this land, by deed from Minnesota prior to August 31, 1872.

Railway companies should be held to strict and constant responsibility for the construction of suitable fences, de- pot buildings and freight houses; for the safe, healthful and com- fortable condition of passenger trains; for the prompt repair of de- fective road-bed, bridges and trestle work; for the employment of competent men in every department of railway service, and for the adoption of such improvements in machinery as ensure better pro- tection from accident and security to human life. The order, efficiency and safety thus afforded are all proper objects of legisla- tion, and cannot be intelligently ignored. It is true, that the sel- fish interests of the corporations themselves tend generally to simi- lar results; but in frequent cases, also, those interests tend in a pre- cisely contrary direction. Moreover, a power thus exercised, in- teliigently but not officiously, is often necessary to the profit of the companies, and to their protection from unreasonable exactions. For illustration, the commissioners have been urged by intelligent railway managers during the past season to advise efficient penal- ties for non-payment of fares before entering cars-a reform which would doubtless inure largely to the convenience, if not to the profit of companies, and ultimately to the public. As to this, and other branches of the subject suggested, we ask your serious consideration. RESTRICTIONS YET MORE GENERAL. Having discussed many subjects deemed worthy of the con- sideration of the legislature, and of action, either direct or indirect, but which lie rather upon the surface of this great field of inquiry, we come now to a discussion of several questions, the bearing of which is not so generally appreciated-which have, indeed, received but little public attention, but which, nevertheless, lie at the bottom of the whole inquiry, and, in the judgment of your com- missioners, are to determine the success or failure of state super- vision.

THE CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL VS. THE CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL RAILWAY COMPANY. These causes, although before the court now on motion only, are of high importance, for both the interests and the principles which they involve. Most of the questions to be passed upon were elaborately argued with much learning and ability at the bar, and all have been patiently and laboriously considered by us, in view of the gravity and delicacy of the decision which we have to make. 3—R.

Act ap- proved April 31, 1855. Chap. 445, Laws of 1856, amends the charter of said company, by author- izing certain counties and towns to exchange the land held by them for its capital stock, and thus discharge any mortgage of the company given to se- cure issues of municipal bonds issued in aid of said road. Act approved March 31, 1856. Chap. 444, Laws of 1856, authorizes said company to purchase or lease any branch railroad or connecting railroad, or parts thereof, and when so purchased or leased such roads are declared as fully under the control of the Milwaukee and Horicon Railroad Company as if originally built under its charter. Act approved March 31, 1856. Chap. 124, Laws of 1857, amends the charter of said railroad company, especially as to the right to enter upon and take land for its use. Any asso- ciation organized for musical, dramatic or library purposes, were authorized to subscribe to the capital stock of the company in the same manner as other stockholders. Act approved Feb. 28, 1857. Chap. 285, Laws of 1857, authorizes any county through which said rail- road shall pass, except the county of Marquette, to issue and deliver its bonds, in such sums and payable at such time and place as might be fixed upon, and at a rate of interest not exceeding ten per cent. per annum, and exchange them for the capital stock of said company: provided, that the amount so issued in any one county should not exceed $200,000. No such issue to be. made, however, until the question was first submitted to a vote of the people, and approved by a majority voting on the subject. Act approved March 6, 1857. Chap. 70, Laws of 1859, repealed the above act. Chap. 332, laws of 1864, authorizes any company or organization by what- ever name known, using, controlling or operating the Milwaukee and Hori- con railroad between Horicon and Berlin, to create a sinking fund of 12 per cent. of the gross earnings, to be paid to the state treasurer, and held in trust for the payment of municipal bonds and farm mortgages due from said company, on presentation at the treasury department. A pro rata apportion- ment of such fund was required to be annually made until such obligations were fully paid. In case any such company or organization failed to pay over such sinking fund for the space of thirty days after the first day of Jan- uary in any year, it was made the duty of the governor to appoint a receiver, who, upon filing a bond, was authorized to take possession of such road with all its equipments and buildings, etc., and out of the earnings make the con- tribution to such sinking fund. Act approved April 2, 1864. WATERTOWN AND MADISON RAILROAD COMPANY. The Watertown and Madison Railroad was incorporated by chap. 78, laws &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 103 He estimated the whole cost of the road, exclusive of equipment, at a sum not greater than $950,000—or $20,000 per mile. Seventeen miles of the road were then graded, a portion of the buildings had been erected or were in process of construction, and ties were provided sufficient for the whole distance graded, the sum of which items amounted to $103,004.32. The esti- mated cost of putting in operation the 17 miles then graded, exclusive of fur- niture, was about $160,000. The receipts up to December 31, 1853, had been: $75,323.98 from stock; $21,664.16 from sales of bonds, and $16,000 from tem- porary loans. Seven per cent. bonds had been issued to the amount of $475,000. The whole amount subscribed to the capital stock had been about 3,500 shares. Jan. 2, 1854, a perpetual contract was made with the Chicago and Galena Union Railroad Company, by which the Beloit and Madison Company was to make its road equal in all respects to the Chicago and Galena road, with all necessary and proper appendages, buildings and fixtures, requisite to the full operation of the road, and to charge rates of fare and freight equal to the charges of Chicago and Galena Union Company, and the latter company agreed to pay the Madison and Beloit Company semi-annually ten per cent. upon the gross receipts from freight and passenger business passing to and from any point on the Beloit and Madison road six miles and upwards north of Beloit, and over the whole distance between Chicago and Belvidere, with a condition that the rate of percentage might, if necessary, be increased to not exceeding 25 per cent. until the net earnings of the Beloit and Madison road should equal eight per cent. upon its actual cost. The Galena and Chi- cago Union road also leased the depot grounds and buildings in Beloit, lying between the state line and the bridge across Rock river, on terms not named in the report of the company for that year. It was a part of the agreement with the Chicago and Galena Union that the net receipts of the Beloit and Madison road should in no event be reckoned at less than fifty per cent. of the gross receipts of said road, and that the cost of said road, exclusive of equip- ment, should not be reckoned as exceeding $960,000, or a greater sum in the aggregate, including equipment, than $1,025,090 (about $21,500 per mile.) At the time this contract was made the same person was President of both com- panics, and signed the contract in behalf of both the parties. During the year 1854, iron was purchased for twenty miles of road, and laid on seventeen miles. The line from Beloit to Afton went into operation in August, 1854, and from Afton to Footville, seventeen miles from Beloit, at the close of the year. The whole amount expended for construction up to De- cember 31, was $349,522.31, as follows: Right of way, $24,718.02; grading, $70,095.02; bridging, $11,437.91; superstructure, $200,707.03; fencing, $3,814.73; buildings, $8,105.92; engineering, salaries and incidentals, $16,784.19; car account, $249.40; interest and discounts, $13,610.09. The engineer placed the entire cost of the road from Beloit to Magnolia, twenty miles, nearly com- pleted, at $415,000, or $20,750 per mile, and estimated the cost from Magnolia to Madison, 27.65 miles, at $500,000, as follows: Already expended, $7,466.69; right of way, $15,000; grading and bridging, $160,000; superstructure, &quot; &quot;Errors of Past Legislation. 95 circumstances under which railways are operated, should be wholly ignored, and specific rates, especially of freight, be fixed by law? Obviously, the capital honestly invested in Wisconsin railways is entitled to fair compensation. Obviously, also, it is the duty of the state to protect the people from the payment of unreasonable or extortionate tolls. But does it follow from these premises that the state should prescribe those details of railway management, not necessarily relating immediately to the general object sought to be accomplished? 3. The law takes no account of short distances. As the rates of charges now stand, the cost of a car-load of freight of any kind is the same for one mile and miles. There is reason in making charges proportionally larger for very short than for considerable distances, inasmuch as the trouble of taking, switching and cutting off a car is the same in the two cases; still there is a little difference in the cost of hauling five miles and fifty miles, and, on the other hand, the due accommodation of shippers, and proper regard to the apparent as well as real equity in cases of this sort, have always influenced railway companies in fixing their tariffs, and should also be regarded by the state, if rates are to be determined at all. 4. The law fixes maxima for car loads only. This provision is unjust in two ways: first to the shipper of quan- tities considerable in amount, but just short of a car load; secondly, to the larger shipper, the shipper of several car loads at a time. There seems to us no good reason why the commercial principle of lower prices at wholesale than at retail should not apply to the transportation of freight. During the past season, we have received complaints from parties who were making regular shipments of quantities averaging about a car load, sometimes over, sometimes less, but who, when the quantity fell below a full car-load were always charged by the hun- dred pounds-the price being a sum considerably greater for less than a car-load than was charged for the full ten tons. In all cases of &apos;deficient weight of freight ordinarily rated per car-load, the shipper should have his option as to whether he would pay by the car-load or by actual weight. It is equally clear that a shipper who loads a whole train, and who, by shipment of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of car-loads annually, 2 &quot; &quot;42 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

In the case of HENRY M. ACKLEY and GEORGE VILAS, Respondents, vs. THE CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE &amp;amp; ST. PAUL RAILWAY COMPANY, Appellant. The facts of this case all appear by the following stipulation entered into by the parties: It is hereby stipulated and admitted- 1st. That plaintiffs are the partners and general owners of the lumber, as alleged in the complaint. 2d. That the defendant is a corporation duly organized under and by virtue of the laws of Wisconsin, and engaged in operating a railroad, and that one part of its railroad extends from Oshkosh to Milwaukee, and thence through Oconomowoc to Watertown Junction, and to La Crosse, a distance of about one hundred and thirty miles. 3d. That the Chicago &amp;amp; Northwestern Railway Company is a corporation duly organized under and by virtue of the laws of Wisconsin, engaged in operating a railroad, and that its line extends from Oshkosh to Watertown Junction, and thence to Chicago, and that said road intersects and connects at said Watertown Junction. 4th. That the distance from Oshkosh to Watertown Junction, over the road of the Chicago &amp;amp; Northwestern Railway, is sixty-three miles, and the distance from said Watertown Junction to Oconomowoc, over the road of the defend- ant, is twelve miles. 5th. That on the 10th day of May, 1874, the said plaintiff shipped said two car loads of lumber at Oshkosh, over the Chicago &amp;amp; Northwestern Railway to Oconomowoc. That said company transported said two loads of lumber over its line of road from Oshkosh to Watertown Junction; and at said Junc- tion, on the 11th day of May, 1874, delivered said two car loads of lumber to the defendant, to be transported by the said defendant to Oconomowoc, sub- ject to the payment of the sum of thirty dollars for the charges of said Chi- cago &amp;amp; Northwestern Railway Company as its compensation for transporting said lumber from Oshkosh to said Watertown; and that said last named com- pany had no line of road from Watertown Junction to Oconomowoc. 6th. That said defendant on the 11th day of May, 1874, received said two car loads of lumber from said Chicago &amp;amp; Northwestern Railway Company, at said Watertown Junction for transportation to Oconomowoc, and then and there paid to said last named company the aforesaid said sum of thirty dollars demanded by it as its compensation for transporting said lumber. The action was brought to recover the lumber. The court instructed the jury that chapter 273 of the Session Laws of 1874 was constitutional and binding upon the railroad companies, that the amount fixed by said act for the transportation of freight was all that the companies were entitled to charge, and that as the distance from Oshkosh to Oconomo- woc was only seventy-five miles, the said railroad companies were only autho- rized to charge fifteen dollars per car load for said lumber, and that as the plaintiffs tendered that amount to the defendant before bringing suit, and the defendant refused to receive the same, the plaintiffs were entitled to said lumber, and that their verdict should be for the plaintiffs. Due exception was taken on behalf of the defendant to such instructions. The plaintiffs had a verdict upon which judgment was duly entered for a return to them of the property and for costs. The defendant appeals. LYON, J. This action was commenced before the late decisions of the rail- way injunction cases were announced and was probably brought to test the validity of chap. 273, laws of 1874, known as the Potter act. In those cases the court did not pass upon that act in detail, but held, generally that the legislature has authority under the constitution, to limit the rates which rail- 6-R. R.-App. &quot; &quot;Remedial Measures. 109 uniform, and the reasons for variation of price correspondingly less. It is true that speed, total distance, and the grade of accom- modations furnished, are causes of variation in cost. But in our own state the incidents of passenger travel on any single line, approxi- mate a common standard, and more justly permit the application of a uniform or pro rata charge. At the time of writing this report, we cannot speak definitely as to the operation of the Wisconsin law in this particular, but elsewhere the principle of maximum passenger rates has been enforced with entire success, and we have seen no positive evidence of evil results from the application of this principle in Wisconsin. While permitting competition, its tendency is to increase travel and simplify management. It cer- tainly gives that certainty to the expenses of travel, which busi- ness men, and particularly all people ofmoderate incomes, earnestly appreciate. Capitalists largely interested in railway property have not hesitated to commend this method of cheapening, simplify- ing and popularizing railway travel, even as a source of profit to the owners of roads, and the experiment ought not to be inconsid- erately abandoned. The policy of cheap fares is further sustained by the experience of European countries. For it is acknowledged that the low rates, now almost universal on the continent, pay better than higher rates used to, or would now, if enforced, saying nothing of the gains to society and to the individual by facilitating travel. The following table, giving the average fares by the different classes of coaches, in several European countries, will be both use- ful and interesting in this connection: Foreign Passenger Fares.

Precisely how much the apportionment of these expenditures to the proper account would add to the net earnings of the company for the year, it is unnecessary for the commissioners to estimate, under existing circumstances. It is believed, however, that had such an apportionment been accurately made for the year named, the net earnings would have quite or nearly sufficed for the payment of all interest on bonds, all operat- ing expenses, and a small dividend on all the stock of the company. The directors of the company practically accomplished the same purpose, except as to the payment of a dividend on the common stock. That is to say, instead of setting apart the whole of the net earnings for interest and dividends, they expended a portion of those earnings for new construction, and paid a dividend of seven per cent. on the preferred stock in new consolidated bonds, thus indirectly adding the cost of new construction to the debt. The difference in the method of disposing of the net earnings adopted by the company, and the direct application of all the net earnings to the payment of interest and dividends, is, that by the method adopted by the company, the owners of the common stock run the risk of being compelled to contribute their share of the net earn- ings wholly to the capital for the general benefit. DEBT AND EARNINGS FOR WISCONSIN. In treating of net earnings on this road thus far, we have had reference to all the lines owned by the company. The comparative facts as to that portion of the lines within the state, and that por- tion of the lines without the state, during the year 1873, are worthy of special consideration. The funded debt of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Rail- way Company is now consolidated. The total of this debt and stock for 1873, (exclusive of cost of Western Union Road), amounted to $52,435,494. If apportioned upon the basis of length of road, the amount imposed upon lines within the state of Wisconsin, is about $37,480 per mile, or an aggregate of about $23,313,000. The aggregate amount of debt and stock charged by the company to the Wisconsin portion of its road in 1873 was $27,161,630. &quot; &quot;Official Papers and Correspondence. 333 23 [CIRCULAR No. 12.] INQUIRIES AS TO ACTUAL PRESENT VALUE OF RAIL- ROADS. [Addressed to all Wisconsin Railroad Companies. Answers published in another portion of this volume.] OFFICE OF THE BOARD OF RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS, To : MADISON, Sept. 1874. The undersigned Railroad Commissioners, being required by law to report to the state upon the cost of all lines of railway within the state, have, by reso- lution, determined to request of each of the several companies owning and representing the same, to procure and submit to the Board a detailed estimate of the actual present value of the road or roads, and each branch or division thereof, if branches or divisions exist, under their control in this state; such estimate to be made regardless of original cost or capital, or of debt incurred therefor, and to specify separately the present estimated cash value of the real estate, right of way, grading and masonry, bridges, superstructure, sta- tion and other buildings, engines and cars, and of every other sort of equip- ment and property belonging to each of said roads and essential to their operation, respectively, as aforesaid; such estimate to be so made, likewise, as to include a statement of the sources of information, as far as may be, upon which the estimate in each case is based,-whether upon actual observation by officers, or upon special surveys and calculations by engineers or others having practical experience in the construction of the road or branches de- scribed. In pursuance of this resolution, we respectfully request of you such an es- timate of the Company&apos;s road at the earliest day practicable. With a view to mutual convenience, as well as to completeness and uniformity of the estimates reported, we enclose berewith a black form, upon which please in- sert said estimate in detail.

CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL RAILWAY. PRAIRIE DU CHIEN DIVISION. Chartered February 11, 1847, from Milwaukee to Waukesha, under the name of &quot;Milwaukee and Waukesha Railroad Company.&quot; Capital stock $100,000. Charter amended March 11, 1848, extending the road via Madison to some point in Grant county on the Mississippi river. Capital stock, $3,000,000. Name changed to &quot;Milwaukee, Waukesha and Mississippi Rail- road Company,&quot; and February 1, 1850, to “Milwaukee and Mississippi Rail. road Company.&quot; Subscriptions to capital of the Milwaukee and Waukesha Company were first made at Milwaukee and Waukesha, February 7, 1848, and books were kept open until $100,000 were subseribed. First directors elected May 10, 1849. At the end of the year 1849, total subscriptions to stock amounted to $600,000. Survey from Milwaukee to Waukesha commenced June 7, 1849. Under this survey the maximum grades ascending to the west- ward were reported at 25 feet to the mile; eastward, 6 feet. No deep cut, no high embankment, no rock excavation, and no expensive bridges between Milwaukee and Waukesha. The estimated cost of this portion of the line- 201½ miles-based on actual contract prices, and on actual proposals for iron, including entire cost of finished road and equipment, ready for operation, with necessary depot buildings, was placed by the directors in their annual report to the stockholders for the year 1849, at $232,652 or $11,349 per mile. The price of iron was included in this estimate, at $50 per ton. At the close of the year 1850, subscriptions to capital stock, by citizens of Wisconsin and by the city of Milwaukee, had reached nearly $1,000,000, which subscriptions had been paid to a considerable amount, by mortgages on improved real estate in the country. The president of the company as- serted that operations thus far had shown that the cost of the road complete, with the necessary buildings, would be about $12,000 per mile. At the close of the year 1851, the length of road in operation was about 30 miles, and the directors assumed that a sufficient amount had been expended on all the line completed and in course of construction, to equal the cost of 38½ miles. The total expenditures up to January 1, 1872, as far as ascertained, were as follows: grading and bridging, $146,818.16; superstructure, $246,485.43; right of way, $9,407.54; real estate, $24,230.15; Waukesha depot and machine shop, $24,531.43; shop tools and fixtures for same, $2,670.00; Milwaukee de- pot, including filling, $1,911.46; water stations, $641.11; equipments, $71,718.65; engineering, $18,743.99; interest and exchange, $49,434.69; inçidental expenses $4,745,39; special expenses, $18,596.71; loan expenses and commission, $12,465.16;. salaries, printing and stationery, $52,874.32; personal property, $2,612.65;. &apos; &quot;vi Report of Railroad Commissioners.

The net earnings were $46,100, and the in- terest paid, $46,500. By act of April 9, 1852, the Madison and Prairie du Chien Company was incorporated, and by act of June 25, 1853, the Madison and Prairie du Chien Company and the Milwaukee and Mississippi Company were authorized to consolidate in accordance with terms agreed upon, June 25, 1853. The road was opened to Stoughton, May 24. During the year 1853 and 1854, the road was completed to Madison. Total miles in operation, December 31, 1854, 105. The gross receipts for 1853 were, $226,918.48-the net receipts, $134.340.14. The gross receipts for 1854 were, $456,864.78-the net receipts, $307,632.41. After paying all interest upon the debt, the balance of net receipts was declared equal to 22 per cent. upon $754,665.32—the whole of the outstanding stock, except that held by the city of Milwaukee as security for bonds, on which the road paid the interest. This balance of net earnings was used for cancelling debts of the company, and a dividend of 15 per cent. paid to stockholders in stock, amounting to $113,199.70. The remainder of net earnings was reserved for repairs and debt. The annual deterioration of road, from use and decay, was estimated from 2 to 4 per cent. Total funded debt, December 31, 1854, $1,750,000, of which $302,500-more than all the floating debt-remained in the hands of the company. Total paid stock, same date, $988,655.32; total floating debt, $233,002.80; total expenditure, $2,729,082.11. Expenditure west of Madison $100,000. Total expenditure on 105 miles of road in operation, for all pur- poses whatsoever, from the organization of company, $2,679,082.11—about $25,500 per mile. &quot;This cost includes very valuable and extensive depot grounds, equal in value to $500,000.&quot; The engineer reported, &quot;a superior road bed and superstructure cannot be found on any road in this country.&quot; The company awarded from six to thirty acres of land to each of the sta- tions-at Janesville, 16; at Milton, 10; at Fulton, 25; at Stoughton, 25; at Madison, 30; at Whitewater, about 10; at Milwaukee, about 20, in the heart of the business portion of the city, including 320 feet on Milwaukee river and 2,000 feet on the Menomonee river. At the end of the year 1854, the com- pany had purchased and contracted for the right of way and depot grounds for the entire distance from Madison to Prairie du Chien, and Engineer Edg- erton estimated the cost of completing the road from Madison to the Wiscon- sin river at $13,090 per mile. In April, 1855, the company contracted for the completion of the road from Madison to Prairie du Chien. The contract provided for a first class road, equal to that portion between Eagle and Madison, including right of way, fencing, crossings, cattle-guards, etc., and the expenditure of $100,000 for buildings. The length of road was stated at about 100 miles, and the con- tractors were paid $2,014,500–$1,230,000 in bonds of the company, $250,000 in mortgages taken in payment of stock, $100,000 in cash, and $434,500 in stock, all at par.

It appears by ch. 57, laws of 1868, of the state of Wisconsin, that the “Chi- cago and Northwestern Railway Co.,&quot; which had received the grant to aid in constructing a railroad from Fond du Lac northward to the state line, had caused the first two hundred and forty sections of land to which it might be- come entitled, to be appraised, and that the 153,600 acres were appraised at $1,840,000, or about $12 per acre; and that about 1859 that railway company issued &quot;to persons aiding in the construction of its railroad,&quot; &quot;convertible land grant certificates &quot;entitling the holders thereof to receive said lands in proportionate shares, the proportion being such as the amount of money for which the same was given, and expressed therein, bore to $1,840,000. By section 5 of said chapter 57, these certificates were authorized to be re- ceived in payment for the purchase of the lands included in the grant; but the price was to be at least twelve dollars per acre. This grant was six miles wide, deficiencies to be made up by selections within fifteen mile limits. The grant was estimated to embrace 600,000 acres of land, and up to June 30, 1873, 522,144.51 acres had been certified or patented. The first 240 sections, or 153,600 acres, appraised by the com- pany at $12 per acre, would yield The balance of the grant, 446,400 acres, estimated at $5 per acre, would yield.. Total $1,840,000 00 2,232, 000 00 $4,072, 000 00 The distance from Fond du Lac to Menomonee is 116.9 miles, making the value of the grant, at a moderate computation (and without including the eighty acres of the &quot;Fort Howard military reserve,&quot; which is believed to be very valuable), almost $35,000 per mile for the entire distance.

Com. of Wis., Madison, Wis. “DEAR SIR: In answer to your inquiries respecting the land grant of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company in Wisconsin, I would state, that I find that the Commissioner of the General Office, in his report of 1873, estimated the quantity of land in the grant at 600,000 acres. &quot;I find, on examination, that of this amount, there was received by the Chicago, St. Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad Company, 211,0630 acres, which were sold under the mortgages given by said company on decree of court, and I have no means of determining what they were sold for. &quot;That the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company has received about 350,401 acres, and have sold 30,4183 acres of the best and most valuable of the lands received by it, (they being bought for the pine timber on the same), for the amount of $96,881 being an average of $3 per acre. 100 &quot;I have no means of determining what could be realized for the balance of said lands, but if the company could get a bona fide offer of $1.25 per acre for the balance, so that it could get released from further payment of taxes and expenses on the same, I would most certainly recommend its officers to accept the offer. &apos; &quot;196 Report of Railroad Commissoners.

OFFICE CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL R. R., MILWAUKEE, May 12, 1874. H. A. TENNEY, Esq., Clerk Board R. R. Com&apos;rs, Madison: DEAR SIR:-Replying to yours of the 11th, I beg leave to enclose you tariffs bearing date January 27, 1873, which were in force June 1, &apos;73. I see it announced that the Mineral Point road has notified the Commis- sioners of a willingness to comply with the law. It has doubtless occurred to the Commissioners that a road of the length of the M. P., if they could get the rates of the law, would probably make more money than they have been making. I see the Commissioners are about to prepare a classification. I hope they may be successful. I have been nine years trying to perfect one, so as to harmonize with other roads. Truly yours, O. E. BRITT, G. F. A. THE COMMISSIONERS TO MR. BRITT. OFFICE OF THE RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS, MADISON, May 13, 1874. O. E. BRITT, Esq., Gen. Freight Agent Mil. &amp;amp; St. Paul R. R. Co.: DEAR SIR: Yours of yesterday, enclosing freight tariffs in force on your road, June 1, 1873, is received. We thank you for your suggestions, and shall warmly appreciate any fur- ther suggestions or information which you may feel inclined to offer us at any time. &quot; &quot;Official Papers and Correspondence. 31 Attempts are frequently made to do a large amount of business on a single track, when if the three-feet gauge had been adopted, two tracks could have been constructed at the cost of one on the usual gauge. When the success of the first naarow gauge was assured, it was claimed that as feeders to trunk lines and where there was a small amount of business and little money to construct roads, they would be desirable; but now the field of through trunk lines is strongly contested, and it is claimed by those who have had practical demonstration of the superiority of the narrow gauge that it is more desirable in every respect than the standard gauge. To enter into detail as to the advantage of the new gauge over the old, let us begin with the first cost. Statistics shows that in this country the average actual cost of the old gauge roads have been more than $20,000 per mile; of the new, less than $9,000. Now as to the relative cost of transportation by the two sys tems. The advantage in the narrow-gauge is in the reduced amount of dead weight in proportion to paying freight. The broad-gauge empty car weighs 8½ tons; it will carry 10 tons of freight. An empty narrow-gauge car weighs a little less than three tons, and will carry 5½ tons. Compare two freight trains carrying 160 tons each—the one 16 cars, the other 29: Broad gauge.. Narrow gauge Saving in tons 160 Paying Dead Load. Weight. 136 Total Cars and Load. 296 160 87 238 58 In passenger trains, there is a difference of 262 pounds in dead weight in favor of the new gauge. The wear and tear involved in the use of such enormously heavy locomo- tives as the moving of heavy broad-gauge trains require, the crushing out of rails, the breakage of draught irons, links, bumpers, and like well known expenses, are reduced to a minimum in the new system. In reference to the road from Milwaukee to Beloit, much of which is al- ready graded, with many of the abutments of the bridges in good order, I estimate the cost of the superstructure with a 4 ft. 8½ in. track, at $9,515.70 per mile; a narrow-gauge superstructure complete, at $5,561.30 per mile. These estimates include cost of rails, sleepers, straps and bolts, spikes, track- laying, frogs and switches, road crossings, signs, ballast, engineering and contingencies. The advantages of the narrow gauge as to first cost, as to cost of operating, and as to the ability to do the work required are admitted, but it is claimed that it should not be adapted on account of the expense that would be in- curred in the transfer of through freight where the break of gauge is in- volved. This is an objection, without doubt; but a careful examination of the subject shows the difficulties to be very much exaggerated. On the Canada frontier, many years&apos; experience has shown the cost to be but five cents a ton. And, indeed, the cost of transfer is so inconsiderable, that in Europe transhipments are made, where there is no break in the gauge, cheaper &quot; &quot;16 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

Lands applicable to the distance from Portage City to Tomah, 61 miles. On the 28th of Dec., 1857. Gov. Coles Bashford certified to the Secretary of the Interior that the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company had com pleted 40 continous miles of railroad westwardly from Portage city, under the act of Oct. 11, 1856, entitled an act to grant certain lands to the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, and to execute the trust created by act of Congress June 3, 1856: On the 4th of Feb., 1858, Gov. Alex. W. Randall addressed a letter to the Secretary of the Interior requesting that all action be suspended under the certificate of Gov. Bashford until further information was furnished from him. This request was acceded to by the Commissioner of the General Land Office per letter of Feb. 19, 1858. On the 23d, of July, 1858, T. A. Hendricks, Commissioner of the General Land Office, addressed a letter to Gov. Randall enclosing one received by him from A. P. Stanton President of the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Co. The letter from A. P. Stanton recites that by the law the company was entitled to 240 sections of land, when the first 20 continous miles were com- pleted, and 120 sections of land for each 20 continuous miles of road subse- quently completed by the co., and claiming the land due upon the construc- tion of 60 miles of road, 307,200 acres, 40 miles of which had been certified to by Gov. Bashford, and 20 which Gov. Randall refused to certity to. The Commissioner informs Gov. Randall that as the case had been called up he would hold it open until the 15th of August, 1858, to enable him to make his objections to the adjustment of the grant; that if he should not be heard from before that time he would feel at liberty to act upon the showing before him. Gov. Randall replied, July 23, 1858, stating that the conditions upon which the grant was made by the state to the company had not been complied with, the contract being, that the company should build roads from Madison, and from &apos; &apos;Records of Railway Companies. 159 a new consolidated company having one board of directors.

In Supreme Court. THE STATE OF WISCONSIN VS. THE CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE AND ST. Paul RAILWAY COMPANY. A Scott Sloan, Attorney General of the state of Wisconsin, who sues for the said state in this behalf and in its name, comes here into the supreme court of judicature of said state, before the justice thereof, at the capitol in the city of Madison, on the eighth day of July, in the June term of said court, in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, and for and in the name of said state gives said court here to understand and be informed, and shows and alleges that the above named defendant in this action, the Chicago, Mil- waukee and St. Paul Railway Company is a corporation duly created, organ- ized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Wisconsin. And the said Attorney General, in the name and in the behalf of said state, further gives the said court here to understand and be informed, and charges the truth to be, that the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company was incorporated under the statute laws of the state of Wisconsin, under the name of the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, by filing articles of association in the office of the Secretary of State of the state of Wisconsin, on the 5th day of May, 1863, which said articles of association were demanded by an act of the legislature of the state of Wisconsin, entitled &quot;An act to amend the articles of association of the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company,&quot; approved April 2, 1864. That said articles of association were ratified and confirmed, and said company, with among other things, declared to be a corporation by an act of the legislature of the state of Wisconsin, entitled &quot;An act ratifying the organization of the corporation therein named,&quot; approved April 10, 1865; that at a meeting of the stockholders of the said Mil- waukee and St Paul Railway Comyany, held in the city of Milwaukee on the 7th day of Feburary, 1874, at which were present, in person or by proxy, a majority of all the stockholders of said company, the name of said cor- poration was changed to the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway company by a resolution unamiously adopted, which resolution was duly recorded in the office of the Secretary of State of the state of Wisconsin, cn the 11th day of February, 1874. And the said Attorney General further, as aforesaid, gives said court to understand and be informed, and states the fact to be, that the said defendant, on the first day of January, 1874, owned and operated about six hundred miles of railroad within the said state of Wisconsin, and ever since that time has used, operated and managed, and now does use, operate and manage the same in the transportation of reight and passengers upon its said railroad. And the said Attorney General further, as aforesaid, gives the court to understand, and offers and shows that the legislature of the state of Wis- consin, at its annual session in the year 1874, duly passed an act, entitled &quot;An act relating to railroads, express and telegraph companies in the state of Wisconsin,&quot; approved March 11, 1874, which said act was duly published on the twenty-eight day of April, 1874, and took effect on said last mentioned day, and thence hitherto has been, and now is, in full force and operation, and that the said defendant, mentioned and described in said last named act, as the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, by which name it was then theretofore and still is commonly known and called, and that there is no corporation in this state by the name of the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, and has not been since the change of name as above stated, except as the road applies to the defendant, and whenever the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company is mentioned in said act, the defendant is meant and attributed to the company referred to and spoken of. And the said Attorney General further, as aforesaid, informs and gives the &apos; &quot;Official Papers and Correspondence. 39 1. General offices at NAMES OF DIRECTORS. Residence. Names of Directors.

Owing to various causes, this board accomplished but little, and the next year was abolished; the Board of Trade being left to make on its own responsibility, such special reports on questions of public safety, violations of railway law, consolidations, etc., as to it should seem proper. The first report of the Board of Trade touching the consolidation schemes of 1845 (of which there were many), is of special interest as having laid down the guiding principles that should govern par- liament in passing upon such measures, namely: &amp;quot;That amalgama- tions should not be generally or precipitately conceded; that they should be allowed either where the amalgamated lines were branches or feeders, or where they formed part of one continuous line of connection; but that they should not be allowed where the companies had an independent existence, or where the object was to put an end to competition; and they suggested that working ar- rangements, being temporary, and capable of revision, would often be found preferable to amalgamations.&amp;quot; In 1845, important acts were passed for the encouragement of the competition observed between railway companies and canals, and the policy was adopted of incorporating the following provis- ion into all railway acts subsequently passed: &amp;quot;Nothing herein contained shall be deemed or construed to exempt the railways by this act authorized to be made, from the provisions of any gen- eral act relating to railways, or the better and more impartial audit of the accounts of railway companies now in force, or which may hereafter pass during this or any future session of Parliament, of the maximum rates of fares and charges, or of the rates of small parcels, authorized by this act.&amp;quot; In 1846, the pressure of amalgamation bills became so great that the House of Commons appointed another special committee to take testimony and report upon the subject. &quot; &quot;Records of Railway Companies. 9) Samuel D. Hastings Treasurer of the state of Wisconsin, John M. Keep, George L. Schuyler and Thomas McFarland, defendants, that the mortgaged premises mentioned and set forth in the pleadings in the said cause, be sold by or under the directions of the marshal of the district of Wisconsin, at public auction, at the postoffice, in the city of Milwaukee, in said district, the then marshal, Jehu H.

But they are valuable, coming from the source they do, for the reason that they point unmistakably at the particular evils in railroad management, which need correction in the interest of the public, and tc which legislation should be directed. Evidently experience now indicates to us that if legislative con- trol is to be interposed to protect the public from being over taxed by railroad corporations, the first step in that direction should be to establish such relations between them and the people, as would ensure confidence in the management. To accomplish this, legal enactments must restore the public to those rights which were im- plied when the charters were granted and accepted. If the needed provisions of law were not incorporated in the original charter, then subsequent legislation should supply the deficiencies. Next to a limitation of capital (cost), no one point is more im- portant than an absence of concealment in regard to the business of the company. And legislation should enforce it. If the com- pany is established upon a legitimate basis, if there is a bona-fide element of stockholders, if the stockholders are really the company and the owners of its property, then it is imperative that they should be familiarly acquainted with its business condition, and in such case it virtually becomes known to the public. If the element of stockholder has been lost-has no real practical existence— then still more important is it that the public should have con- stantly before it the business conduct of the &quot;corporation.&quot; But- in the interest of the public the law making power should provide against the contingency of a company which is so in name only, and furthermore create by legal enactments such provisions as would of necessity restrain the managers of a road from executing im- portant business operations without previous notice to the public, and first receiving authority therefor from the stockholders. This could be provided for by quarterly, or at most semi-annual meet- ings of the stockholders, as already adopted in England. At these meetings, full reports of the business of the company would be &apos; &quot;122 Report of Railroad Commissioners. bursements. To this end it is important that the following con- ditions should be fulfilled: (1) They must be kept on correct principles, all receipts being honestly credited to their real sources, and all expenditures charged to the proper account, care being taken, where there is room for doubt, that the capital account, especially, be not unduly increased. (2) They should be kept so as to be separable for the different lines, where more than one line is operated by one company. This especially where, as in this state at present, the companies pay a state tax proportioned to the earnings of lines within the state. is also important as enabling the state and the public to know to what extent new lines-sometimes lying in other states—are a bur- den upon the old ones; and also enabling the managers themselves to know what the interests of the company demand. It (3) The freight account should be so kept as to make a full show- ing of every shipment of freight, with the class to which it belongs, weight in pounds, stations from which and to which shipped, and the amount actually received and charged to the company thereon; the freight account of each station showing for itself, and the ac- counts at the general freight office showing the exact business and freight receipts at all the stations on each and every line. Such keeping of accounts is essential to the proper management of the roads, and to the state important as furnishing correct data for a full understanding of the company&apos;s condition. (4) The accounts kept by all the railway companies of the state should be uniform as to method, in order that the working of dif- ferent roads may be compared, and that uniform reports may also be possible. (5) They should be closed and accessible to the stockholders both before and after the regular meetings at which they are pre- sented for approval, and should be published in full abstract, with balance sheet, for the use of the stockholders and the state author- ities. FULL AND COMPLETE REPORTS. Regarding the possibility of secrecy as affording encouragement to fraud and mismanagement, on the one hand, and, on the other, as being a frequent occasion for unwarrantable suspicion on the part of the public, we are strong in the conviction that it is of great importance to both railway companies and people, that the reports made by such companies should be very much more full and thor- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;&quot; &apos;Official Papers and Correspondence. 13 rates of compensation for services performed are not accepted, it is, first, because the law of self preservation is paramount in the human breast; and secondly, because we have been advised by our legal counsel that a decision by the supreme authority of our country fully sustaining and endorsing the position we are now forced to occupy, will be rendered at an early day. 6: We also find in Wisconsin Law Reports, Vol. 25, in case of Whiting v. The Sheboygan &amp;amp; Fond du Lac Railway,&quot; a most elaborate and exhaustive opinion rendered by Chief Justice Dixon, and concurred in by the entire bench, bearing directly upon the legal points involved in the present unfor- tunate issue between the state and her railway proteges. From this judicial opinion, I beg to briefly quote: &quot;The power of the leg- islature to regulate the tolls and charges of such (railway) companies, is in itself a limited one, if not in a constitutional sense, certainly in the sense of morality and justice. If there be not an express, there is certainly an im- plied obligation and promise on the part of the state never to reduce the tolls and charges below a standard which will be reasonable, or which will afford a fair and adequate remuneration and return upon the amount of capital actu- ally invested.&quot; This obligation and promise, which spring from the act of incorporation and invitation by the state to persons to invest their money in the stock, it is presumed no legislative body would disregard. The true intent and object of the power is, that the legislature shall be able to protect the rights and in- terests of the people, but not that it shall arbitrarily or unnecessarily impair the rights or franchises of the company, or destroy the property of its stock- holders. The good faith of the state is pledged against this, and it is not within the range of presumption that it will ever be done. The individuals owning the property, and whom the corporation represents, purchase it under this pledge and inducement held out by the state. The legislature will not reduce the tolls or rates to an unreasonably low figure, or so as to disappoint the just expectations of the owners of stock. It will not destroy the earnings of the road or cut off satisfactory dividends upon the cash capital paid in, if the business of the company is such as to afford them. In fine, it will hold the company only to the receipt of reason- able tolls, and this with a view to the nature and extent of its business, the expenses necessarily incurred by it, and the amount of capital invested. The legislature will not cut down the tolls unreasonably with a view to compensating the loss of the company by taxing the community at large, for that would be to defeat the very principle upon which all these companies are organized and roads built. That principle is, that those persons should pay for the building and operating of the roads who use them and as they use them. They pay their taxes for these improvements when they pay their tolls. This opinion cannot fail to have due weight with the courts of the state, and with the supreme court of the United States, should any appeal be taken thereto. &apos; &quot;126 Appendix. access thereto as if the same had remained in the office of the originol com- pany.

As a result of this universal anxiety to extend our systems of railway, the charters have, in the main, been generously drawn in the interest of the corporations, to the almost total exclusion of the thought of limitations of power; and much special legislation has been added, as a means of confirming to them privileges, advant- ages and powers directly opposed, as now appears, to the best in- terests of the people. In view of all the facts, perhaps it should not be surprising that we have added to the errors of omission the fault of illogical and abortive legislation of a positive character; aiming, as we have chiefly done, at effects and symptomatic conditions, rather than at causes. FAULT OF PAST RAILWAY LEGISLATION IN WISCONSIN. 1. The early legislation not sufficiently guarded. For proof of the liberality of Wisconsin toward railroad enter- prises, we may confidently refer to the abstract of laws accompa- nying this report, and to the numerous charters granted in excess of the real demand. The legislation has been generous, but it has not been sufficiently guarded, and even we have not escaped the errors of our sister states. If under the peculiar provision of our constitution, the legisla- ture may regain what has been lost, still there stands the ugly fact, that, in many cases, the efforts and sacrifices made, as well as the money invested, would not have been so made and invested but for the guaranties freely and solemnly given by the state, in the form of legislative enactment. To be just to the people, it is difficult to avoid being unjust to the railroad companies. 2. Past legislation too special. We mean to say, much has been done by special legislation that could have been better accomplished under general laws. This upon the principle, that the least legislation the better, the ends of good government being secured. This is especially true as applied to great corporations, legislation concerning which is so liable to be attended by influences of demoralization, to say nothing of the unnecessary expense that must be met by both the state and the petitioners. Happily, however, Wisconsin, following the example of the English parliament, and of many of her sister states, has now passed this point of danger. &quot; &apos;20 Appendix. PETITION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. In Supreme Court. THE STATE OF WISCONSIN VS. THE CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN RAIL- WAY COMPANY. The above named plaintiff, the state of Wisconsin, by A. Scott Sloan, At- torney General of said state of Wisconsin, by leave of the court for that pur- pose first duly had and obtained, complains of the above named defendant, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, and informs the court and shows and alleges that the said Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company is a corporation duly created, organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Wisconsin. That the said Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company was incorpor- ated by an act of the legislature of the territory of Wisconsin, entitled an act to incorporate the Madison and Beloit Railroad Company, approved August 19, 1848, and an act of the legislature of the state of Wisconsin, entitled an act to amend an act entitled an act to incorporate the Madison and Beloit Railroad Company, approved February 9, 1850, and the acts amendatory of the aforesaid acts and supplementary thereto. That by an act of the legislature of the state of Wisconsin, entitled an act to authorize the railroad companies therein named to consolidate their cap. ital stock, approved March 10, 1855, the said railroad was authorized by the board of directors to select, choose and nominate for itself any name that a majority of the directors might deem fit, and that subsequently a majority of the said directors did duly select, choose and nominate the name of the Chi- cago and Northwestern Railway for said company defendant. That the said defendant on the first day of January, 1874, owned and operated about five hundred miles of railroad within the said state of Wisconsin, and ever since that time has managed and operated the same in the tranportation of freight and passengers upon its said railroad. And the plaintiff further shows that the legislature of the state of Wisconsin at its annual session in the year 1874, duly passed an act entitled &quot;an act relat- ing to railroads, express and telegraph companies in the state of Wisconsin, approved March 11, 1874. That the said act was duly published on the 28th day of April, 1874, and took effect on said last mentioned day. That in and by the provisions of said act among other things, all the rail- roads of the state were divided into classes; all freights to be transported upon said railroads or any part thereof after the passage of said last men- tioned act were classified and the compensation to be charged and received by the companies owning, managing and operating said railroads for the transportation of freights and passengers over their respective roads fixed and limited as therein prescribed. And the plaintiff further informs the court and shows that the said defend- ant, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, on the 29th day of April, 1874, filed in the office of the governor of the state of Wisconsin, a com- munication in writing, signed by its president, Albert Keep, in which among other things, it announced its intention to disregard the provisions of said chapter 273, so far as the same attempts to fix rates of compensation for the transportation of freight and passengers, and to manage and operate its railroad within the state of Wisconsin without regard to the requirements of said act of the legislature. And the plaintiff further informs the court and shows upon information and belief that the said defendant has adopted and issued a tariff of rates for freights between local stations within the state, and a tariff rates for treights and passengers transported over its roads within said state of Wisconsin, and a classification of freights, each and all of which are in disregard of the classification and rates fixed by said last mentioned act of the legislature and contrary to the requirements of the same. &apos; &quot;Executive and Legal Documents. T 11 OPINION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL SLOAN. To His Excellency, WILLIAM R. TAYLOR, Governor of the State of Wisconsin: SIR:-In pursuance of your request, I submit the following opinion: 61 The legislature of the state of Wisconsin, at its last annual session passed an act relating to railroads, express and telegraph companies in the state of Wisconsin,&amp;quot; being chapter 273, and which took effect on the 28th day of April, 1874. This act classified all the railroads of the state, fixed and limited the com- pensation to be charged for the transportation of freight and passengers there- on, and provided for the appointment of three railroad commissioners with the powers and duties therein prescribed. The question submitted to this office, is as to the constitutionality and va- lidity of this enactment. The constitution of the state provides, Art. XI, § 1, &amp;quot;that corporations may be formed under general laws, but shall not be created by a special act, ex- cept for municipal purposes, and in cases where, in the judgment of the leg. islature, the objects of the corporations cannot be attained under general laws. All general laws or special acts enacted under the provisions of this sec- tion may be altered or repealed by the legislature at any time after their passage.&apos; 991 ་ It seems to be conceded on all sides that the railroads of this state take and hold their franchises subject to this reserved power of alteration and repeal; but the precise meaning of the reservation, and what, if any limits shall be applied to it, have led to some discussion and difference of opinion. Since the decision of the Dartmouth College case, in which the supreme court of the United States held that a charter of incorporation was in the nature of a grant, creating a contract, beyond the power of the legislature to impair, many of the states have, by general statutes, special clauses in cor- porate charters, or by constitutional provisions, sought to re-establish over such corporations the legislative control, which, previous to that decision, was supposed to exist. And any construction which so limits this reserva- tion of power, as to deprive the legislature of all supervision over, or right to regulate, the exercise of the franchise, would fall far short of the evident intention of its enactment, and of the remedy which it was designed to afford, against the encroachments of powerful corporations. This intent is well ex- pressed in the case of Tomilson v. Jessup, 15 Wall., p. 454, in which Justice Field, delivering the opinion of the court says, &amp;quot;the object of the reservation and of similar reservations is to prevent a grant of corporate rights and privileges in a form which will preclude legislative interference with their exercise, if the public interest should at any time require such interference; it is a provision intended to preserve to the state, the control over its con- tract with the corporations, which, without that provision would be irrepeal- able, and protected from any measures affecting its obligation.&amp;quot; The courts of our own state have had frequent occasion to refer to this con- stitutional provision, and while they have not passed upon the direct ques- tion now presented, have expressed an opinton as to the purpose of its adop- tion and of tts scope and effect. In the Madison, Watertown &amp;amp; Milwaukee Plankroad Co. v. Reynolds, 3 Wis., p. 287, there was an amendment of a territorial charter, affecting the rate of toll which might be charged by the plankroad company, and the point raised was that the act of incorporation was a contract under which the company invested its money, in consideration of the tolls it was authorized to receive, and that the legislature could not amend the charter by reducing such tolls, and thus take away a portion of the property of the company. Chief Jus- tice Whiton, after discussing the question under the territorial laws, quotes Art. XI of our state constitution, and remarks, &amp;quot;this provision may obviate the necessity of the consideration of questions like the one before us, in all cases where the corporation is created by the state,&amp;quot; a singularly mistaken idea, if it be indeed true that the provision reserves no power of alteration to &quot; &apos;114 Appendix.

June 3, 1856, upon the condition that the state of Wisconsin shall relinquish its right to tax the said Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, or its traffic, for or on account of its being the owner of said lands, as provided by chapter 122, laws of 1856, or the successor to the grantee or donee of said lands so granted by congress to aid in the construction of said railroads; &apos;and, WHEREAS, It is desirable that the said mortgagors should receive all the benefits which they can from such lands, and to that end the legislature of the state of Wisconsin is willing, and does hereby consent and agree that said lands may be used, devoted and applied to and for the use and benefit of the said mortgagors, and to carry out and accomplish the end and purpose aforesaid. The act further provided for a commission which should take charge of the whole matter and report annually. By chap. 56, P. &amp;amp; L. Laws of 1871, approved February 11, 1871, the com- missioners were designated the &amp;quot;Wisconsin Railroad Farm Mortgage Land Company.&amp;quot; By act of congress July 27th, 1868, approved July 27, 1868*, the legisla- ture of the state of Wisconsin was authorized to dispose of the lands granted and which may have enured and been certified to the state of Wis- consin under the act of June 3, 1856, to aid in the construction of the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad, for the benefit of the Wisconsin Railroad Farm Mortgage Land Company, existing under and by virtue of the laws of Wisconsin: Provided, however, that the act apply only to such lands as may be due the state of Wisconsin for the portion of said road already completed. On the 15th Sept., 1868, the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company gave a quit-claim deed to the Wisconsin Railroad Farm Mortgage Land Com- pany, which recites, among other things, that the act of Oct. 11, 1856, con- firming land grants, had been accepted by the La Crosse and Milwaukee Rail- road Company. That Dec. 31, 1856, for the purpose of borrowing money, said company has issued its bonds secured by deed of trust, covering its line of proposed road from Madison by way of Portage City to St. Croix river or lake, and by said deed of trust had conveyed all such interest as said railroad company had then or might thereafter acquire in all the land granted by the act of Oct. 11, 1856, so far as the lands were applicable to the construction of the road from Madison by way of Portage City to St. Croix river or lake. That the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company subsequently built and completed 61 miles of said road, to-wit, from Portage City to Tomah, but never received any title to, or conveyance of said lands, or any portion thereof except as above specified. That the said company subsequently made default in the payment of the interest on said bonds, and thereupon said trustees filed their bill of foreclos- ure of trust deed in U. S. District Court on December 5, 1859. Sale was had by U. S. Marshal, April 25, 1863, and all the interest of the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railway Company in and to said lands, sold to Wm. H. White and Wm. W. Pratt, the sale being confirmed by the Circuit Court of the United States. *See Appendix. &quot; &apos;281 Report of Railroad Commissioners. &quot;CHICAGO, ST.

Columbus by the way of Portage City to the St. Croix river or lake, and from thence to the west end of Lake Superior and to Bayfield; constructing simul. taneously from Madison to Portage City, and from Columbus to Portage City as nearly as practicable; both to be completed by the last day of December, 1858; and for the purpose of estimating and selecting the lands granted by congress, the city of Madison was designated as the point of commencement cf said road, and the lands were to be selected as the road was built; the first 20 miles completed entitling the company to 240 sections of land, to be selected from the lands within the first 20 miles from Madison, and within the 6 and 15 mile limits, and so on. That no part of the road from Madison to Portage City was built, and it was impossible that the company could ful- fill its contract within the time limited. That &amp;quot;the company bought the law by a system of bribery and corruption unparalleled in the history of civilized nations.&amp;quot; That they &amp;quot;have been using a large amount of land grant securities to build a piece of railroad from the junction of Tomah to the city of La Crosse, entirely off the line of the road, at a sacrifice of nearly one million of dollars on their par value.” He says, &amp;quot;I am called upon to wink at these failures of contract and diversion of lands, and to sit quietly by while the munificent grant made by congress is encumbered by mortgage bonds, and the securities sacrificed at thirty cents on the dollar for purposes never intended by the law making power.&amp;quot; * * * &amp;quot;In behalf of the state I protest against the issue of any patent to this state of any lands granted by congress until the question is fully settled here, that, by law, the company is entitled to them. The policy adopted in the west for building railroads has been a bad one. Building roads to make business instead of to accommodate business, on promises to pay, is a false system. Directors grow rich, the roads lan- guish, and stokholders suffer. I advised against such a system years ago. I anticipated the bitter end tha: by such courses is sure to come. I fear the ruin and suffering and bitterness it brings in its train.&amp;quot; JUNE 28, 1862. E. L. Buttrick, who had &amp;quot;been appointed an agent to make selection of such lands as the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company might be entitled to receive,&amp;quot; addressed a letter to Gov. Salomon, in which, after reciting the different steps which had been made in regard to the grant of lands claimed by the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad, he further states that, Dec. 28, 1857, Gov. Bashford gave a certificate of the completion of 40 miles of the land grant road from Portage City westwardly, and that appli- cation had been made to Gov. Randall for a certificate of completion of 20 additional miles, who refused to certify, because Madison was not made the starting point of construction. He says: &amp;quot;I send statement and report of the directors for 1859, and beg leave to refer to Judge Bronson&apos;s opinion, page 16, and correspondence between the presi- dent of the company and the Secretary of the Interior, pages 20 and 21, etc., and then asks: &amp;quot; for the certificate which Gov. Randall refused.&amp;quot; He further states that the department at Washington does not put the construction of Gov. Randall upon the grant, and quotes Judge Thompson, &amp;quot;that the certifi- cate of the Governor of the state respecting the completion of any 20 continu- &quot; &quot;102 Report of Railroad Commissioners. millions of dollars annually to this great grain producing section o our country.

Your complaint will be put upon record and brought to the notice of the Attorney General. Respectfully your obedient servant, JOHN W. HOYT, Railroad Commissioner. ATTORNEY GEN. SLOAN TO ATTORNEY JOHN C. SPOONER. JOHN C. SPOONER, Esq.: MADISON, Nov. 10, 1874. DEAR SIR:-Complaint is made that the West Wis. R&apos;y Co. has refused to furnish cars to M. &amp;amp; C. Obrecht of Baraboo, at any price. I call your atten- tion to this complaint, and hope you can give an explanation which will save the necessity of legal proceedings. Yours truly, A. SCOTT SLOAN, Att&apos;y General. SUPERINTENDENT W. G. SWAN TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. WEST WISCONSIN RAILWAY, Gen&apos;l Superintendent&apos;s Office, Hudson, Wis., 20th Nov., 1874. A. SCOTT SLOAN, Esq., Att&apos;y Gen&apos;l, Madison, Wis.: DEAR SIR:-Your communication of the 10th inst., addressed to our Gen&apos;l Attorney, Col. John C. Spooner, was duly referred by him to me. Continued absence from home, however, has prevented my giving it earlier attention. It appears that our agent had been billing lumber consigned to Mr. Obrecht, Baraboo, at the rate provided in the so called Potter act, for the given distance, as between Rudd&apos;s Mills and Elroy-same being inside of the first distance of 50 miles, and the rate for such a haul being $13 per car load. I am not informed as to the rate charged by the C. &amp;amp; N. W. R&apos;y Co. from Elroy to Baraboo. It also appears that Mr. Obrecht declined to pay the ac- crued charges upon arrival of the lumber at destination. And the conse- quence of the trouble made by the gentleman named with the local agent of the C. &amp;amp; N. W. R&apos;y was, that our cars were delayed so long that we actually lost money in carrying the lumber to Elroy. As this was at a time when our cars were in active request for shipping grain and merchandise, I did not consider that in justice to this company&apos;s interest, I should permit its prop- erty to go beyond our own control, and therefore declined to furnish empty cars belonging to the West Wisconsin road for the purpose of being loaded with Mr. Obrecht&apos;s Lumber. It seems that the cars of the other road were in demand for grain shipments from points in Minnesota (to which the Potter rates are not applicable,) and I received instructions not to permit their cars to be loaded with lumber, but to return them empty to Elroy as fast as possible. These causes, as frankly explained, have led to the situation as stated by you, viz: that Mr. Obrecht &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 89 divisions was as follows: Eastern Division, $60,000; Western Division, $2,121,000; Northwestern Division, $5,016.000; Watertown Division, $400,- 000; Portage Division, $720,000. Actual and estimated total cost of divisions, $13,860,085.38. The average cost per mile of each division, based upon the costs as above stated and estimated, including 12½ pcr cent. for side track, is as follows: Eastern Division, $26,571.88; Western Division, $21,264.53; Northwestern Division, $22,248.91; Watertown Division, $25,753,21; Portage Division, $19,067.44 — or a general average of $23,061.71 per mile, including interest, discounts, cost of financial agencies, and all other contingencies. - By act of congress approved June 3, 1856, there was granted to the state, for the construction of a railroad from Madison or Columbus, by the way of Portage City, to the St. Croix River or Lake, thence to the west end of Lake Superior and Bayfield, every alternate section of land designated by odd numbers, for six sections in width on each side of said road. The right was also granted of selecting other lands within fifteen miles, on either side of the route, in lieu of odd numbered sections previously sold or appropriated. By act of the legislature approved Oct. 11, 1856, the La Crosse Company was authorized to construct a road from Madison and from Columbus, and thence on the route prescribed by the act of congress, and to receive the grant. During the year preliminary surveys were made. The value of the lands granted was estimated by the land commissioners of the company, at $17,345,600, and the cost of the Western, Northwestern and Portage divisions of the road (369 miles) was estimated, when completed, at $8,956,637.48. On the 31st day of December, 1856, the company executed a deed of trust to Greene C. Bronson, James T. Soutter and Shepherd Knapp on its conditional claim to these lands and on the divisions of the road last named, constructed or to be constructed, as security for the payment of the company&apos;s bonds to the amount of ten million dollars. During the year 1857 the road was completed to Portage City, and track was laid on the Western Division as far as New Lisbon, 43 miles west of Portage City. In the meantime the total stock and debt of the company had increased to $15,980,708.63, including collateral, amounting at par value, to $917,670. Dec. 26th the Watertown Division was sold to the Madison, Fond du Lac and Michigan Railroad Company, which relieved the La Crosse Com- pany of $717,000 for which it became liable by the consolidation, and also of $283,000 of 8 per cent. second mortgage, which the Madison, Fond du Lac and Michigan Company assumed. September 26th the La Crosse Company executed to the contractor, Selah Chamberlain, a lease of the entire road, in order to secure a continuance of work upon the line, and the payment of arrears due the contractor, then amounting to over $600,000, for which amount an entry of judgment was permitted. At this time the stock of the company was selling at six per cent. and the land grant bonds at 20 per cent. A change of directors ensued, giving a majority in direction to eastern stock- holders. In December a contract was made with Mr. Chamberlain to complete the land grant road from New Lisbon to the Junction, by September, 1858. The &quot; &quot;20 Report of Railroad Commissioners. Among the results of the first-named method, there will appear from the statistics referred to: (1) that the companies repcrting to this state had, on the 31st of December, 1873, a total mileage of 4,686.70 miles of railway exclusive of sidings, of which total, 2,360.16 miles belonged to Wisconsin; and (2) that the total cost of the 4,686.70 miles, as reported to the state on that date, was $156,862,288.39, or 33,467.31 per mile; the mileage and cost of each road being as follows: COST of Railroads reported to this State, Dec. 31, 1873.

The returns on pages 186 to 226, inclusive, merit special attention. In order to procure them, the commissioners, early in autumn, ad- dressed a circular to the several railroad companies doing business in this state, accompanying the same with a blank form, requiring detailed estimates as to the present cash value of the property in- vested by such companies within the state. This information, as far as obtained, will be found in the subsequent pages of this re- port. Though not complete, it is yet valuable with reference to future estimates, and as an example of what may be accomplished by continuous investigation by this method.

[See Appendix 6, 115.] Seventy-one miles of this line was in operation and a large amount of work had been done between Mendota and St. Paul (eight miles), and on other parts of the line. According to the terms of this consolidation, the McGregor Western Company took the Minnesota Central, subject to a mortgage of $2,000,000 and to a floating debt of $100,000, and paid therefor $2,000,000 in the stock of the McGregor and Western. The purchase of the McGregor and Western road by the Prairie du Chien Company transferred this contract of consolidation to the latter company, which, under the terms of their agreement with the McGregor and Western, thus secured the Minnesota Central by the payment of $1,000,000 in stock for the $2,000,000 in stock issued by the McGregor and Western Company. The whole line thus acquired extended from McGregor to Minneapolis, 220 miles. Of this line 85 miles-from Cresco to Owatonna -then remained to be built. The construction of this portion was placed under contract the same year for $3,000,000-$2,000,000 payable in mortgage bonds upon the whole line from McGregor to St. Paul, and $1,000,000 in the common stock of the Prairie du Chien Company. By the terms of the sale to the McGregor Western Railway Company, by the Minnesota Central, the lands belonging to the Minnesota Central Com- pany were reserved from the sale to the Minnesota Company, and conse- quently did not pass into the hands of the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company when the McGregor and Western was transferred to the Milwaukee and St. Paul. The amount of these lands of the Minnesota Central sold and con- tracted to be sold prior to Aug. 31, 1873, was 64,893 acres, at an average price of $6.54 per acre. The officers of the Minnesota Central, Nov. 25, 1873, were Selah Chamberlain, President; Russell Sage, Vice-President, and Russell J. Baldwin, Secretary. The following is a list of the property of the Minnesota Central, reported to the Minnesota legislature for the year ending August 31, 1873: Engine houses, 6; machine shops, 1; wooden bridges (aggregate length 3,203 feet), 20; trestle works (aggregate length 8,280 feet), 64; locomotives (average weight 54,000 lbs.), 36; snow plows, 3; first and second class passenger cars, 15; mail, express and baggage cars, 4; freight cars (estimated), 325. The capital stock issued in August, 1873, was estimated as follows: common stock, $1,651,048; preferred stock, $1,500,952; total stock, $3,152,000. Funded debt, 7 per cent. bonds (estimated proportion for Minnesota), $2,450,000. The gross earnings for the year ending August 31, 1873, were $765,795.01, and the net earnings $128,916.77. The amount paid for dividends (on preferred stock) the same year was $52,533.32, and the amount paid for interest was $171,500; cap- ital stock per mile of road operated (148), $21,297.30; funded and unfunded debt per mile, $18,200.39. Total, per mile, $39,497.67. Gross earnings per mile, $5.174, 29. Operating expenses per mile, $4,303.23.

These articles of consolidation, made and entered into this fith day of June, in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, between the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad Company, a corporation for railroad purposes, cre- ated and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Illinois, party of the first part, and the Milwaukee and Chicago Railroad Company, a corporation for railroad purposes, created and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Wisconsin, party of the second part, Witnesseth, That said parties have, with the assent in writing of a majority of their respective stockholders, duly filed in the offices of their secretaries, agreed, and do hereby agree, each with the other, to unite and consolidate their respective stock franchises and corporate property into one company and corporation, upon the terms and conditions following, viz: First. The corporate name of the consolidated company shall be &quot; Chicage and Milwaukee Railroad Company,&quot; and said new company shall, by its said corporate name, have, possess and exercise all the corporate rights, franchises and immunities now held and exercised by the parties hereto in the states of Illinois and Wisconsin respectively, under and pursuant to the laws of said states. Second. The affairs of said consolidated company shall be managed by a board of nine directors (until sucl. ti.ne as said number shall be properly changed by said consolidated company), said directors to be chosen by the stockholders of the respective parties hereto voting, either in person or by proxy, at a meeting to be held on the twenty third day of June, 1863, at the office of said company in Milwaukee. The directors so chosen to hold their offices until the second Tuesday of February, A. D. 1864, and until their successors are chosen and enter upon their duties. All elections, however, after the first above provided for, to be subject, as to time and place and manner of holding the same, to the by-laws of said consolidated company. Third. The capital stock of said consolidated company, shall be the pres- ent, and until changed by the said company, two millions two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, which shall be divided into shares of one hundred dol- lars each; one million of which said stock shall be issued to the stockhold- ers of said Milwaukee and Chicago Railroad Company in exchange for the stock held by them respectively in said Milwaukee and Chicago Railroad Company on the surrender of the certificates of said second party, now held by them for like amount; one million two hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred dollars of said stock, shall be issued pro rata to the stockholders of said Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad Cempany, on the surrender of the certificates of said first party now held by them, and the remaining sum of twelve thousand five hundred dollars of said stock of the consolidated com- pany is to be appropriated to the payment of the expenses incident to said consolidation, to be divided between the parties hereto in the proportion of 10-R. R.-App. &apos; &quot;The Problem to be Solved. 71 That effectual competition by sea should be guarded by prevent- ing railway companies from getting control over public harbors. That canals are also some reliance for competition; that their fa- cilities for through shipments, whether by other canals or by rail- ways, should be increased, and that no canal should be transferred to, or be placed directly or indirectly under the control of any rail- way company. That equal mileage rates are inexpedient. That there should be publicity of rates and tolls. That there is need of a new tribunal, consisting of three railway and canal commissioners for a careful and thorough supervision of the transportation interests of the kingdom, with authority to en- force the laws relating to those matters, to hear complaints and set- tle disputes, and with the further duty of assisting and advising Parliament in railway legislation. These conclusions were generally approved, and the Railway Commission has been appointed in accordance with the recommen- dation. We have been thus full in our account of attempts to settle the railway problem in Great Britain, for the reasons-that the experi- ence of that country has been more extended than that of any other; that the English railway system, if such it can be called, is more like our own; that the habits, spirit and temper of the Eng- lish people are also similar; and that the whole subject of legisla- tive control of corporations has been so often and so laboriously inquired into by the best minds of that advanced nation. 2. Attempt to solve the railway problem in France. The French railway system is totally different from those of Great Britain or America-different, indeed, from that of almost any other country. It is neither the system of free and independ- ent companies, on the one hand, nor the system of government rail- ways on the other. Competition is purposely prevented, instead of encouraged. Up to 1842 but little had been done in the way of construction. In that year, nine great lines were authorized. In 1852 two or three consolidations took place, and they were reduced to six in number; the government assigning to each an extensive district of the empire for its field of operations; and the companies undertak- ing, as a consideration for this favor of insuring them against compe- &quot; &quot;The Problem to be Solved. 79 of its cost, and sometimes even of its debts. This increase of cost, growing out of a departure from the objects aimed at in the orignal construction, and a chase after the phantom of &apos;through business,&apos;&apos; western connections,&apos; tribu- tary roads,&apos; while by the expenditure of further sums for more equipment,&apos; &apos;larger depots,&apos;&apos; steamboat connections&apos; and material aid to connecting roads. an aggregated capital has accumulated, the interest of which will impose a tax upon its local business, inasmuch as for its through business it is compelled to maintain a competition with rival lines who can or do perform it at a mini- mum of profit.&amp;quot; During the intervening years, there have been many fruitless at- tempts at legislation looking to a correction of these and other evils of which the commissioners then made complaint. The measures were chiefly too late in offering themselves. The corporations had become more influential in the halls of legislation than the voice of justice. Passenger fares have been fixed at a maximum of three cents a mile for the roads generally; at two cents per mile for the New York Central; and at two cents in summer, and two and a half cents in winter for the Hudson River road. The railroad companies report annually to the State Engineer, under whose direction the reports are published. These restrictions excepted, the corporations have matters pretty much their own way in New York. 2. The railway problem in Massachusetts. So far as appears from published documents, Massachusetts only became fully aroused to the importance of adopting some method of dealing systematically with the railroads of the state in the year 1869. Various laws had been previously enacted, most of them relating to matters properly classed as police regulations, but no action had been taken with a view to a full and final settlement of the relations between the corporations and the state. In that year a law was passed creating a board of commissioners, charged with certain general duties pertaining to inspection of roads and the observance of the laws in force, as well as with the duty of hearing complaints and petitions, and, finally, of making a report, annually, to the legislature &amp;quot;of their doings for the preceding year, containing such facts, statements and explanations as will dis- close the actual working of the system of railroad transportation in its bearing upon the business and prosperity of the commonwealth, and such suggestions as to the general railroad policy of the com- &quot; &apos;Executive and Legal Documents. 59 cise of the sovereign right of eminent domain, with the construction and operation for public purposes of hundreds of miles of public thoroughfare of the most dangerous character to public safety, with a virtual monopoly within its district of the carrying trade, with almost a control of all com- merce within its reach, and a power almost of life and death over its people, -and yet it is a private corporation, whose charter the legislature cannot control; while the most insignificant town in the state, with no extra territo- rial influence and hardly any extra territorial recognition, is invested with the dignity of a public corporation, over which it is unsafe to deny legisla- tive control. It is not to be overlooked that the decision was made long before the era of great corporations in this country, long before what were then private corporations had become of more public significance than municipal corpo- rations were then, long before our present civilization hinged almost as much on quasi private corporations, as Hallam says early modern civiliza- tion did on municipal corporations; before Judge Story had lived to see a bank, which he defined to be a private corporation, notwithstanding its pub- lic relations, wage war, unequal at last, but long doubtful war, with the Fed- eral government itself. The difficulty arises probably, from applying old names to new things; applying the ancient definition of private corpora- tions to corporations of a character unknown when the definition arose, cor- porations of such great and various public relation and public significance; a definition which, as applied to them, is wearing out, so that courts are be- ginning to call them quasi private corporations and quasi public corpora- tions, as in truth they are. The remarks since made, fro.n time to time, on this decision, by the court which made and has always hitherto sustained it, are perhaps the severest commentary upon it, in the broad sense in which it is applied. It deprives the states in a large measure of their sovereign prerogative, and establishes great corporations as independent powers within the states, a sort of imperia in imperiis, baffling state order, state economy, state policy. Well might a distinguished judge of the same great court, when the extent of the evil was becoming apparent, start back, shocked at the claims of corporate immunity trom law, and cry out: &quot;No state, it is declared, shall pass a law impairing the obligation of con- tracts; yet with this concession constantly yielded, it cannot be justly dis- puted that in every political sovereign community, there inheres necessarily the right and the duty of guarding its own existence, and of protecting and promoting the interests and welfare of the community at large. This power and this duty are to be exerted not only in the highest acts of sovereignty and in the external relations of governments; they reach and comprehend like- wise the interior polity and relations of social life, which should be regarded with reference to the advantage of the whole society.&quot; And he adds, speak- ing of the right of eminent domain: &quot;It would imply an incredible fatuity in the states to ascribe to them the intention to relinquish the power of self- government and self-preservation.&quot; West River Bridge Co. v. Dix, 6 Howard, 507. It was lately said by the same court, speaking of this construction and application of the constitutional prohibition: &quot;A departure from it now would involve damage to society that cannot be foreseen, would shock the sense of justice of the country, unhinge its business interests, and weaken, if not destroy, that respect which has always been felt for the judical depart- ment of the government.&quot; Binghampton Bridge, 3 Wallace, 51. Perhaps so; there is always inconvenience and sometimes danger in abandoning old rules of judicial decision. But there is danger in adhering to this rule. And it is not always the better part of wisdom to bear the ills we have, than fly to others that we know not of. And it must be conceded that the language of the court, just quoted, sounds rather like apology than jurisdiction. Be all this as it may, the rule in Dartmouth College v. Woodward stands, and we must all yield to it while it does stands. Neither this nor any state court can disregard or evade it, while the court which established it may see fit to ad- here to it. And the rule that corporate charters are contracts within the pro- hibition, has been expressly applied by that court to railroad charters. Wil- mington R. R. Co. v. Reed, 13 Wallace, 264; Humphreys v. Peques, 16 Wallace, 244. &apos; &apos;Evils of Railway Construction and Management. 51 bye and bye, a rival line should be established, and the traffic should be less than equal to the carrying capacity of both, the two are almost sure, after fruitless efforts to drive each other from the field, to form a combination, agreeing either to demand equal rates agreed upon, or to &quot;pool&quot; their earnings. This point having been reached, the public have no ground of hope except in the possibility of a falling out of the companies and renewal of the competition which gave origin to the compact. For the companies themselves, there seems, in most cases, to be no safety but in a still closer union, under an act of consolidation from which there is no breaking away. The controversy, then, is irrepressible, if the reliance is upon economical laws alone; being a conflict between the necessities of soeiety, on the one hand, and the natural selfishness of strong mo- nopolies on the other. OTHER DIFFICULTIES.-EVILS OF RAILWAY CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT. To make the matter worse, the roads are often so constructed, and railway transportation so managed, as to almost compel heavy exactions on the part of the railway companies, and lead to dissatisfaction and condemnation on the part of the public. INDIVIDUAL INTEREST, WITH NO HARMONIZING GENERAL CONTROL. An overshadowing evil, attendant upon railway construction and operation, is the fact that all railway enterprise is the result of individual interest and purpose, subject to no harmonizing general control. The consequences are comparative disorder, the misappli- cation or actual waste of much energy and capital, and a want of economical accord in the practical administration of railway affairs. The public confidence in competition as a protection from exorbi- tant charges, has not only proved delusive, but has also furnished occasion for the payment of increased interest upon an increased capital. In some portions of our state, and, in one notable instance, between one city of our state and one city of another state, we find two roads running where one would equally suffice, and the public charged with the obligation of paying interest upon the capital of both. To avoid inconvenience and losses consequent upon discordant management, the companies themselves are impell- &apos; &apos;84 Appendix.

We also made an inspection of nearly every building on all your lines, and found a much larger aggregate than we had anticipated, especially at the principal termini. The aggregate of all items, at which we have arrived, will not surprise those familiar with railway construction, but we are aware that it is liable to be doubted by some others. For this reason we submit herewith the details of our estimate, made from an extensive personal knowledge of the original construction, and from all existing records of the work. In making our estimate of the salaries of officers and agents essential dur- ing construction in the assumed period of two years, we have gone some- what beyond the proper sphere of our profession, but have done so in order to complete the estimate according to the plan indicated by the Railroad Commissioners. Having based our estimate upon cash, we have not included the cost of raising money, the discounts on securities, and the interest on expenditures during construction. Neither have we included the cost of organization, charter expenses, advertising, publication of notices required by law, record- ing fees, etc. These latter vary greatly in different cases. Our estimate of the value of your road in the state of Wisconsin on the first day of January, 1874, on the above basis, amounts to $28,850,820, as will appear from the schedules herewith submitted. It will be suggested that certain parts of the property are depreciated either by wear or decay. We have considered this subject with reference to all those items which are liable to depreciation, and we estimate the deprecia- tion as follows: Bridging... Ties, track and ballasting. Buildings and fences... Rolling stock.. $307,000 1,756,000 1,060, 000 840,000 Amount. $3,963,000 Making the aggregate present cash value to be $24,887,820, which is equal to $37,146 per mile of main track, or $32,490 per mile of main and side track. Herewith are the estimates of each line separately, marked consecutively from A to H2. The schedules accompanying the same are marked consecu- tively A to H. (Signed) Yours respectfully, B. H.

Up to the present time there has been expended about $40,000. The road is to be a three-foot gauge, and the division north of Wauzeka is to be constructed with hard maple rail. Thorough experiments have been made during the last year by E. H. Williams of the Iowa Eastern Railway as to the adaptability of maple rails for narrow gauge railroads, with very satisfactory results. About two miles of extension of that road is ironed with maple rail. The plan for raising money for construction adopted, is, to dispose of the bonds along the line. At first the progress made was slow. Enough has now been done to give assurances of success, and it is believed to be practica- ble in this way to build a narrow-gauge railroad anywhere through a settled country where such a road may be needed, without going abroad for money, or, as people say here, without money. Explorations have been made south of Wauzeka, and it is believed that a more favorable line exists and will be adopted than the line originally pro- posed down the East Pecatonica, to wit., from Montford via Belmont and Shullsburg to an intersection with the Illinois Central Railway Company at or near Warren. No bonds of the road have issued yet, but soon will be ready. Any further information will be communicated with pleasure. Very respectfully, L. M. CULVER, Sec. C. &amp;amp; T. Ry.

EXCESSIVE CHARGES. Unjust charges for transportation are commonly denounced, because just here is the point of universal and painful contact between the public and the corporations. And yet, in most cases, they are only the immediate result of the more primary evils already noticed. They are the symptoms in many cases, rather than the disease, Considered as an evil in themselves, they are hard to deal with, for the reason that, beyond a rather uncertain limit, it is quite impossible for any one not possessed of the data for a nice mathematical calculation to say whether this tariff or that is excessive. If, in the absence of such data, the attempt is made to determine the question by a comparison of the tariffs of different roads, such method is likely to be found unsatisfactory, owing to the great number of modifying circumstances, that require to be taken into the account. But leaving out of view causes and particulars, it is unquestionable that the public in almost every state have had to pay more for transportation than should have been necessary; certainly more than was compatible with the welfare of the indus- trial classes. THE RAILROAD SIDE OF THE QUESTION. Having thus dwelt at considerable length on the evils of railway management, it is perhaps essential to a just consideration of the measures to be employed for their correction, that we should recur for a moment to the very important part raflroads have played in promoting the industrial, social and political progress of the world. To present in detail the beneficial results of railways is of course impossible. They are at once innumerable and immeasurable. Nor is it possible to make a summary that will convey an adequate gen- eral conception of the benefits they have conferred. Having mileage enough for a continuous track six times around the entire globe; moving annually a tonnage of some twenty thousand million dollars in value, and passengers scarcely less in number than the population of the whole earth; stimulating the productive forces of industry everywhere; rendering easy many 5-R. R. &quot; &quot;24 Report of Railroad Commissioners. way organizations of the state, no railroad company in Wisconsin earned an adequate compensation on its assumed capital during the year 1873. We have already incidentally expressed our conviction of this fact in another portion of this report; and we here add, that in the opinion of the commissioners, the assertion made as to these roads for the year 1873, is equally applicable to all previous years, and also to the year 1874. EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE. The operations of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul and of the Chicago and Northwestern companies are possible exceptions, and in order to determine the extent of restrictive legislation in respect to these companies, the statistics reported demand a closer scrutiny. For this purpose, we do not propose any reference to facts other than those given in the certified reports of the com- panies themselves, or otherwise obtained from reliable sources. GROSS EARNINGS OF CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL RAILWAY. On the 31st day of December, 1873, the total length of this road according to the printed report of the company, was 1,399 miles, and length in Wisconsin 622 miles. The cost of the whole property at that date was represented as follows: Mortgage Bonds Preferred Stock.. Common Stock Total... Less cost of Western Union. Company&apos;s stated cost of 1,399 miles Or about $37,480 per mile. $26,262,500 12, 274, 483 15,399,261 $53,936,244 1,500, 750 $52,435,494 The gross earnings of the same year were $9,046,123, or an amount exceeding 17 per cent. of stated cost. The operating expenses of 1873 are given at $6,594,560, or over 12 per cent. of stated cost, and about 73 per cent. of gross earn- ings. The net earnings, thus ascertained, were $2,451,563 or 4.67 per cent. of total cost. From these net earnings were paid the interest on bonds, amoun- ting to $1,839,643, or over 7 per cent. on the total amount of bonds, and leaving an excess of $611,920—or about 2.21 per cent. on the total amount of preferred and common stock. &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 251 COUNTIES.

March 11, 1865, the Prairie du Chien Railway Company leased the Mc- Gregor Western Railway, in the state of Iowa, for the term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years; took possession of that portion of the road in operation at the close of that month, and of the whole road, finished and unfinished, on the 1st of the ensuing August. The Prairie du Chien Company was to complete the road and supply rolling stock; was to operate the road and, after deducting expenses of operation and repairs from earn- ings, was to receive 8 per cent. per annum on the cost of the equipment fur- nished; the remainder of the earnings were to be applied to the payment, first, of liens and judgments against the road; second, of maturing interest on the bonds of the road, not exceeding $28,000 per mile upon the first 60 miles, and not exceeding $15,000 per mile upon a further length of road, and the balance to the McGregor Western Company. The Prairie du Chien Com- pany were also permitted to complete unfinished portions of the road from its own funds, or from the earnings of the leased road, and to receive 8 per cent. interest upon all funds advanced for this purpose.

The law treats connecting lines as continuous, but is silent as to division of earnings. The difficulty of executing this provision of the law has been made manifest during the past season. A large proportion of the complaints made have related to the unwillingness of the compa- nies to divide earnings upon an equitable basis. The law provides that &quot;in computing the rates for carrying any freights according to the provisions of this act, the distance for carrying such freight shall be computed from where it is received, notwithstanding it may pass from one railroad to another.&quot; This makes it necessary that the roads so connecting shall be treated as one line. But the section establishing the rates that may be charged allows for the first and second 25-mile hauls much the larger share of the earnings, leaving the several companies to equalize them in some manner. If the amounts of freight carried both ways over connecting lines were equal, the earnings would of course equalize themselves. But this is rarely or never the case. Should the out freights be great in excess of the in freights, upon a given road, it is apparent that such road would have the advantage in the pro- portion of first, as compared with second or third hauls. Under ordinary circumstances, all such matters are settled some- how by the companies among themselves; but where the law im- posing restrictions as to earnings is felt to press a little, it appears to be natural that the company having the worst of it should pro- test, and that the company having the best of it should he re- luctant to divide equally. In the cases above referred to, some of the companies have in- sisted that the commissioners should prescribe the rule of division, urging the provisions of section 5 as their authority for so doing. The commissioners have not understood this to be a part of their duties, however, and so these matters are still in dispute. As to the terms proper to be fixed, the rule in common use in European countries, and, so far as we know, which the companies everywhere, being free to act, observe among themselves, is to make a pro rata division according to mileage, after deducting terminal and other charges, should there be other charges, not equal- ly borne by the several parties to the joint service. &apos; &quot;Records of Railway Companies. 171 resume, retake, have, hold and enjoy, all and singular, the said rights, pow- ers, privileges, stock and franchises, do as aforesaid, and hereby transferred by it to the said party of the second part as fully and completely as though these articles had not been entered into by said parties.

CONSOLIDATION. Articles of consolidation, made and entered into this first day of July A. D. 1871, between the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company, a corporation exis- ting under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Wisconsin, party of the first part, and the Manitowac and Minnesota Railroad Company a corpora- tion existing under and by virtue of the laws of said state, party of the sec- ond part- WHEREAS, the said parties are authorized by act of the legislature of the said state to effect a union of their respective roads and properties, and to form by consolidation of their corporate rights, one company and have agreed so to do upon the terms and conditions hereinafter mentioned and contained. &quot; &apos;100 Report of Railroad Commissioners. loss; we must therefore conclude that the charges fixed would be such as would afford a fair per centage of profit upon the capital invested. Now, in owning a road and running it, the government is necessarily put in possession of positive facts as a basis to enable it to regulate charges. Granting that the power to establish rates is inherent in the state, and that for no other purpose does the state undertake the business of railroading, we are led to the conclu- sion that this actual ownership is necessitated for the purpose of arriving at the facts by which to regulate charges. Is this so? Are there no other relations between railway corporations and govern- ments which are proposed to be remedied by state ownership, look- ing to the protection of the public, and which are assumed to be beyond the control of legislative enactment? If not, the inquiry is reduced to the simple one named,—the regulation of charges. A committee of investigation in England reports that &quot;it is diffi- cult to provide any fixed or self-acting rules which will, through the medium of self-interest, or of the ordinary action of law, do what is necessary to protect the public.&quot; These conclusions do not appear to have been considered as a final bar to experiment, as the commissioner system was at the same time recommended and is now on trial in that country. The very able reports of the Massachusetts Commissioners, how- ever, take a rather positive position in this respect, and advance and advocate the theory that a &quot;natural law of political evolution governing transportation by rail may now be formulated.” This theory assumes that the practice adopted in Europe, of con- trol through state ownership, is the final result of &quot;natural law.&quot; The different phases of experience through which this ultimatum is reached, are presented as being- 1st. Non-interference of government. 2d. Legislative regulation. 3d. Executive supervision. 4th. State ownership. The condition of state ownership being held to be the inevitable result which will be reached; and it is assumed to have &quot;been more clearly illustrated in the experience of America than in that of any other single country.&quot; We think that further experience will prove the fallacy of the conclusions set forth, or we shall also be constrained to admit that the same &quot;natural law&quot; would oblige government to conform itself to suit the requirements of railroads. &apos; &quot;Railway Statistics. 245 GREEN LAKE- Princeton Berlin, city Berlin 8 Sheboy&apos;n &amp;amp; F. duL.

CAUSES OF UNDUE COST OF CONSTRUCTION. If we inquire into the causes of undue cost of railways, they will be found with but little difficulty. Prominent among them are the following: 1. Slight pecuniary interest of managers. It has been the bane of many of our railroad enterprises in this as well as in other countries, that they have originated with, or early fallen into the hands of, reckless adventurers-men who put nothing in, and hence have had nothing at stake. They were skill- ed in the use of blandishments, and in giving a rosy tint to the fu- ture of their favorite enterprises. Building not for use, but as a speculation, it has made but comparatively little difference to them what burdens were saddled upon the public in the form of tolls and rates, or how soon the purchasers might fall into bankruptcy. 2. Construction on credit. With nothing visible but a charter, an exaggerated map of the projected route, and a package of handsomely engraved bonds and stock certificates, the schemer sets out to negotiate a loan and push on the construction of his road, knowing that he will be out of the enterprise long ere the bonds will have to be paid, if not before the road is fully equipped for business The amount of discount is a matter of but little consequence. Stock costs nothing but the price of paper and printing, and it is issued without stint to make the bonds go at even a ruinous price. Bye and bye, the road is built and sold for a handsome sum, the purchaser, of course, assum- ing the burden of debt, the amount of which may be twice what it would cost to build a better road with part cash. It is not essential that every dollar necessary to build a road should be in bank before the work of construction begins; if it were, few roads in a region of country like ours, where there is but little spare capital, would be built. A reasonable amount of credit is legitimate, indeed often absolutely essential; but since the use of it adds greatly to the cost of building, it should in all cases be employed as sparingly as possible. &quot; &quot;46 Report of Railroad Commissioners. ant proceedings of the state authorities for the enforcement of the provisions of chapter 273, the commissioners have published in their proper order each of the several official documents issued in pursuance of such action, including the official letters of Presidents Mitchell and Keep, the proclamation and address of the Governor, the opinion of the Attorney General, and the decisions made by the State and United States courts. And to these we have added copies of the decrees of the United States courts, confirming sales of railroads under foreclosure, and of all such articles of associa- tion, and of acts of consolidation, agreements, etc. of railway compa- nies as were found recorded and on file in the office of Secretary of State, or as could be obtained from other sources; not doubting that such compilation of important documents elsewhere inaccessi- ble to the public, would promote the convenience of all state offi- cials and private citizens interested in the engrossing subject of railway transportation and railway management. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS. Before concluding this portion of their report, your commission- ers feel it their duty, as it is also their pleasure, to make acknowl- edgment of the prompt and cordial manner in which the honorable, the Attorney General, has responded to their demands for legal ad- vice; of the uniform courtesy they have received from all railway officials with whom they have had relations in the discharge of their duties, some of whom have cheerfully undertaken expensive labors at the request of the board; and finally of the laborious and faithful service rendered them by the Hon. Horace A. Tenney, sec- retary to the commission. PART II. GENERAL INVESTIGATIONS. In view of the great importance of an early and judicious set- tlement of the grave questions that divide the railroad corporations and the public, your commissioners have deemed it proper, in ad- dition to the other duties they have endeavored to perform, to in- stitute as thorough an investigation as their time and opportunities &quot; &quot;Records of Railway Companies. 157 forth be held, owned, possessed and controled by the consolidated company by this agreement, formed as fully and completely, to all intents and pur- poses as the said parties hereto respectively do or can now hold, own, use or control the same, and no further conveyance or assurance shall be necessary to fully and completly vest the same in the said consolidated company hereby formed.

They will only furnish the money in the manner that it has hitherto been furnished-on securities at a greater or less discount, accord- ing to circumstances. We are therefore compelled to recognize the fact that discount on securities, the expense of negotiation, interest at exorbitant rates, exchange and commission, and numerous other expenses are necessary inci- dents in this country to the construction of railways, and form a large part of the cost of all roads, and must be considered a part thereof. In our judg- ment, not less than twenty (20) per cent. of the cost of all roads in this state, exclusive of interests on the investments during the period of construction, is chargeable to this account, and we believe the same to be true of the west generally, and that it is a legitimate part of such cost.

SIR:-In submitting to you for the use of the Railroad Commissioners an estimate of the value of those parts of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway in the state of Wisconsin on the first day of January, 1874, the un- dersigned desire to state the basis on which their estimate has been made. Although the blank furnished by the Commissioners is headed &quot;Present Cash Value,&quot; the circular accompanying the same appears to contemplate an estimate of what it would have cost in cash to build your lines if done within a recent period. In this view we have considered the question, what at that time would have been the cost of constructing your lines on the supposition that they had been then recently completed and rendered as permanent, sub- stantial and well equipped, in every respect, as they then were. As no railway can be built in a day, but every road requires a considera- ble time, according to the amount of work to be accomplished, we have assumed two years to be the shortest reasonable time to construct and put in operation, the whole length of 670 miles. The prices of labor and material have been taken at about the average of 1872 and 1873, no allowance being made for a probable increase of wages due to so large an amount of work. The price of labor for the period named is believed to have been about 1 the price of the same from 1851 to 1857, when the principal lines were con- structed. In estimating the cost of the iron, we think we have made it a fair average of the cost of the same in 1872 and 1873. In estimating the cost of right of way and depot grounds we have supposed that real estate stood at the same price without your roads as it has borne with them, but we have not sup- posed a local feeling hostile to their construction. As to grading and masonry, we have taken account of some work done since the first opening of the lines, such as the sink-holes which, in several &apos; &quot;120 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

OSBORN, GEO. H. PAUL, JOHN W. HOYT, Attest: H. A. TENNEY, Clerk of the Board. Railroad Commissioners. [CIRCULAR No. 4.] INQUIRIES CONCERNING CLASSIFICATION OF RATES. OFFICE OF RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS, MADISON, 1874. DEAR SIR:-Please furnish the Railroad Commissioners of the state of Wisconsin answers to the following questions: 1. Into what classes is freight now divided by your company? 2. Under your present classification what articles are assigned to each class? &apos; &quot;68 Appendix. The right reserved in this section is dependent on violation of the charter. That must first be established. That is clearly a judicial function. We need not stop to inquire whether the territorial legislature could have exercised such a function under such a clause, and thereupon repeal the charter. Nor whether the state legislature could do it now. It is enough that neither has done it. And, in any case, the power reserved is simply one of repeal, which can in no way aid the application of chapter 273 to the road built un- der the territorial charter. Sections 1 and 2 of art. XIV. of the state constitution provide, if provision were necessary, for the continuance of the territorial charter in force under the state government. We have carefully examined the several acts of the state legislature appli- cable to the title of this road, so far as it is disclosed to us; and we find noth- ing to defeat or impair the franchises of 1847, as appurtenant to this road, to this day. Sec. 1 of the act of 1860, and sec. 33 of chap. 79 of the revised statutes, both provide that the purchasers on the foreclosure should take the road with the franchises relating to it, as granted to the original company. And this seems to be recognized by the act of 1868. This is not a new grant of franchise. The state had licensed the mortgage of the road and franchise, the corporation had mortgaged the road and franchise, and both were vested in the purchasers by operation of law. The provision of the act of 1860 was only declaratory of an existing right. And as far as the facts are before us, we see nothing to sever the territorial charter from the road, or to operate as a surrender of that charter or as a relinquishment of the franchises granted by it, or as an acceptance of new franchise from the state, to bar the corpora- tion operating the road from relying on the franchises granted by the territory. Neither party appears to have investigated the facts, and they may not be all be- fore us. We rest this opinion on what is before us. And we hold the territo- rial charter of 1847, enlarged by the territorial act of 1848, to be the existing charter of the road built under it from Milwaukee to Prairie du Chien. This charter, being accepted-as we are bound here to assume-before the adoption of the state constitution, is not affected by the reserved power in that instrument. And it is undoubtedly a contract within the rule in the Dartmouth College case, which the state legislature cannot impair. And we have, therefore, the direct question, whether the franchise granted by it, to take such tolls as the company should &apos;from time to time think reasonable,&apos; is part of the obligation of the contract which the state cannot impair, and whether it would be impaired by the application to it of the rule of fixed maximum tolls prescribed by chapter 273. We are of opinion that the franchise is not one vesting in the corporation an absolute right of exacting whatever tolls it might see fit. The courts have authority to limit the right to reasonable tolls; to tolls reasonable, not in the arbitrary judgment of the corporation, but in fact. That is, indeed, as against a great railroad company, not a very effective remedy. But the law gives the remedy to all aggrieved by the exaction of unreasonable tolls. The question here, however, is not what the courts can do to control the exercise, but what the legislature can do by statute to limit the right, of a franchise so broad that it seems to invite extortion. We have already sustained the power of the legislature to limit rates of toll of railroads subject to legislative control. But that power rests on the authority of the legislature, not on the reasonable rate of tolls fixed. And the restraint of a franchise to take reasonable tolls, to tolls reasonable in fact, is a judicial, not legislative function. Any authority of the legislature, not under the reserved power of the constitution, to regulate tolls under a fran- chise to take tolls, cannot be derived from the judicial function, but must rest in some proper legislative function. And therefore, as far as the legislative power over it is concerned, this must be taken as a valid and absolute franchise to take tolls at discretion. And here, again, we think that the question of the right to take tolls, with. out a franchise to take them, does not arise. Because the legislature has given, and the corporation has accepted, a franchise to take them. Whatever right there might have been, outside the franchise, is merged in the franchise. Both parties are bound by the franchise. Viewed as a contract, the fran- chise is the written agreement between the parties on the subject.

He informs me that in giving instruc- tions in relation to forwarding a quantity of loaded cars from Janesville, he gave a general direction, without knowing what the cars were loaded with or from whence they came, to forward all freight there, charging for lumber re- ceived from the Chicago and Northwestern Company from Oshkosh, ten dol- lars per car, and tariff rates for all other freight. That up that time the gen- eral freight agent had not been informed that lumber had been delivered to us at Janesville by the Northwestern road, brought from any other point than Oshkosh. That he had made no rate from any place except Oshkosh, and that he was not aware at the time he gave that order that any lumber had been delivered to us from Fond du Lac. The agents at Janesville and Mon- roe of course obeyed the order according to its tenor. Mr. Britt, in giving the the order, not having any knowledge that lumber had been received from Fond du Lac from the Northwestern road, could not have intended to violate either the agreement of the company or the injunction of the court. Thus far in explanation of the seeming violation of our agreement and under- standing. You will recollect, sir, that on the occasion of making this agreement and understanding with you, I said that, while we would endeavor to avoid vio- lating the injunction granted by the court, we should not submit to the di- vision of rates which other roads might claim, but should demand such just proportion thereof as we deemed ourselves entitled to; and you replied in substance, that that was a matter with which neither you nor the state author- ities had any concern. In order to avoid such complaints as are mentioned in your letter, in fu- future, the management of this road have concluded hereafter to demand pre- payment of all freight charges on lumber received from the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, destined to stations on the line of our road, at the rate fixed by the Potter Law; that is, eight dollars per car for the first twenty-five miles, and five dollars per car for the second, etc., and have this day notified the management of that road of our action. It is our right to demand payment in advance. All authorities agree on this, and each carrier must be his own judge of the circumstances which will justify and even require such action. The Northwestern is not authorized to contract for transportation over our road, and the management of this road has concluded that if the Northwest- ern road is desirous of supplying the stations on our line with lumber, that it can do so only on paying us the rates established by the Potter Law; and in order to avoid all dispute on the subject, we desire to have these rates paid to us in advance. &apos; &quot;228 Report of Railway Commissioners.

J. L. ROOD TO COMNISSIONER HOYT. J. W. HOYT, Railroad Commissioner: MONROE, Dec. 7, 1874. DEAR SIR: I have three car-loads of lumber just arrived at this station, on which they claim $13 per car from Janesville to Monroe, and refuse to give up my lumber unless I pay the amount. The cars are from Fond du Lac, over the N. W. R. R. to Janesville, and over the C., M. &amp;amp; St. P. R. R. from Janesville to Monroe. What shall I do? I want my lumber, but I am not disposed to pay $13 from Janesville to Monroe. The cars were not overloaded Yours, truly. J. L. ROOD. [Letter referred to Gen. Sloan.] ATTORNEY GENERAL SLOAN TO SOLICITOR JOHN W. CARY. JOHN W. CARY, Esq.: MADISON, Dec. 8, 1874. DEAR SIR:-On the 10th of November I called your attention to com- plaints made to the Railroad Commissioners, that your company had charged $13 per car for lumber from Janesville to Monroe, said lumber being shipped at Oshkosh on the C. &amp;amp; N. W. Road, and by that Co. delivered to you at Janesville. In reply to that commnnication, this office was assured that the St. Paul Co. intended to comply fully with the provisions of the Potter Law in that regard, and that there would be no occasion for such complaints in the future. Relying upon that assurance, no steps were taken to call your company to account for violation of the Injunction granted by the Supreme Court. Renewed complaint is now made that you demand $13 per car for lumber shipped at Fond du Lac and carried to Monroe, its place of destina- tion, and refuse to deliver the lumber until such charges are paid. If this complaint is true, it seems to be a deliberate violation of the prom- ise of the company, and of the injunction, calling for immediate action at this office. I trust you can explain it and save the necessity of further pro- ceedings for contempt of the injunction. Hoping to hear from you without delay, I rcmain, Yours truly, A.

The rate per passenger per mile, under the Minnesota law, ap- plicable to the Chicago and Northwestern road (Winona and St. Peter line) is 4 cents, and the rate per passenger per mile under the Illinois law, applicable to the Chicago and Northwestern road, is 3 cents. The General Manager of the Northwestern states, in his report of last year, that the decrease of 1 of a cent per passenger per mile for the year ending May 31, 1873, made a difference on the whole line of only $128,455.10. This upon the presumption that the travel was the same as it would have been under the higher rate. FREIGHT EARNINGS OF CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN. The gain in earnings from freight on the Northwestern road for the year ending May 31, 1873 over the preceding year, was 1453 per cent., while the average rate per ton for 1872 was $3.00 against an average rate for 1873 of $2.91. The average rate per ton per mile for 1872 was 261 cents, against an average rate for 1873 of 23 cents-showing a decreased rate for 1873 of nearly 10 per cent. 2500 from the rate of the previous year. The General Manager says in his report: &quot;Had we transported freight at the same rate per mile per ton, (as the previous year) our freight earnings would have shown a further increase of $857,980.32.&quot; This is upon the presumption that the road would have carried the same amount of freight at the higher rate. The General Manager further says in the same report: &quot;The ex- perience of this company for a term of years shows, that the general and inevitable tendency of its operations is to lower rates of com- pensation for all classes of service, and that the receipts of the com- pany are to be sustained or increased only by swelling the volume of traffic and multiplying the sources of business.&quot; [See Annual Re- port for year ending May 31, 1873, p. 32.] According to the report of the Chicago and Northwestern Com- pany on file in the office of the Secretary of State, the company carried passengers ten years ago at an average rate of 3 cents per passenger per mile. This was during the year ending December 31, 1864. TAXATION AND GROSS Earnings.

That such policy should be insisted upon by the state, and made to ap- pear in resulting &quot;cost&quot; of a road, and the consequent effect upon its comparative earning capacity, cannot admit of a doubt. If it does not so appear in the &quot;cost&quot; account presented, is it not incumbent upon the state to know why? Is it not the duty of the legislature to provide for such judicial investigations as will insure to the people the full benefit of these munificent gift appropriations from the public domain? In this connection the following statement is given of the cost of constructing that part of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company extending from Oshkosh to Green Bay, as reported by Mr. Wm. B. Ogden, the president of the company at the time: Oshkosh to Appleton, twenty miles. &quot;To cover the cost of construction.&quot; Appleton Extension, seven per cent first mortgage bonds.....

The Attorney General has now called our attention to this act. And it was argued that the reserved right to amend, alter or repeal the territorial charter, entered into and become a part of the contract of the charter, when accepted; and thus became a right accrued, which was not affected by the repeal that the repeal could not take effect as to the territorial charter, so long as the charter itself remained unrepealed; the reserved power continu- ing so far to exist, by force of the charter itself, as a contract. These are nice questions, not necessary to the disposition of this motion, and on which we shall therefore not express an opinion. If the territorial charter be a contract, as is held, it became such only upon acceptance by the corporators. Before that, as already seen, it rested in proposition, to ripen into a contract upon acceptance in the manner which it provided. And being so accepted after the territory had ceased to exist, it never became a contract between the territory and the corporation. The state constitution, as already observed, continued in force all territorial acts not re- pugnant to it. The charter thus became a statute of the state. And its ac- ceptance, after the organization of the state, so far as it is a contract, makes it manifestly a contract with the state. There was then no other public au- thority or political body with which the corporators could contract. It is either not a contract or it is a contract with the state. The state adopted the charter then a mere statute, not a contract, so far only as it was not repugnant to the constitution. With the reserved power of the territorial act of 1839 entering into it and forming part of it, as a propo- sition, it was in no way repugnant to the constitution. Without that power, it manifestly was. It is true that the language of Sec. 1, Art. XI, is express- ly prospective. But it is prospective not only as to acts of incorporation, but also as to the formation of corporations. &quot;All general and special acts enacted under the provisions of this section may be altered or repealed;&quot; and, &quot;corporations may be formed,&quot; etc. The whole section, taken together, signifies clearly, not only that no charters should be passed, but also that no corporations should be formed, not subject to the reserved power. It seems to us quite plain that a territorial charter, not subject to the reserved power, and not yet accepted, was &quot;a law in force in the territory, repugnant to this constitution.&quot; Art. XIV, Sec. 2. And the position that its acceptance from the state, after the adoption of the constitution, was an acceptance subject to the reserved power in the territorial act of 1839 and in Sec. 1, Art. XI of the constitution, is certainly a very strong one. There is high authority for going even further. After saying that a private corporation may forfeit its franchises by misuser or nonuser, Mr. Justice Story says: &quot;This is the com- mon law of the land, and is a tacit condition annexed to the creation of every such corporation. Upon a change of government, too, it may be ad- mitted that such exclusive privilges attached to a private corporation as are inconsistent with the new government, may be abolished.&quot; Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch, 43 A fortiorari may this be said of a charter passed before and accepted after a change of government. There is indeed some conflict be- tween these views and those expressed in State v. Roose, 11 Ohio, St., 16. But we shall not comment on that case or pursue this consideration further, be- Cause we shall not rest our decision wholly on it, as there appears to us to be safer and clearer ground for it to stand upon. It was quite competent for the state constitution to have repealed all laws of the territory which had not ripened into contracts, under the rule in Dart- mouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat., 518. So it was competent for it to adopt them. So also to adopt them sub modo. This last is what the constitution did. Sec. 1, Art. XIV, provides that all rights, actions, contracts, etc., as well of individuals as of corporations, shall continue and be as valid as if no change from territorial to state government had taken place. This provision is in favor of rights and contracts, and is properly absolute. It might have applied to the territorial eharter, if then accepted. Sec. 2 provides that all laws then in force in the territory, not repugnant to the constitution, should remain in force until they should expire by their own limitation or be altered or repealed by the legislature. This provision has relation to public policy, &apos; &apos;154 Appendix. mittee of the party of the first part shall be and remain president, officers and committees of the said consolidated companies with their present powers, which, except, as hereinafter limited, may be exercised by them in respect to the joint property and business until the election of the directors of the said consolidated company shall be held as hereinafter provided.

INCREASED RESPONSIBILITY FOR INJURIES AND DESTRUCTION OF LIFE. In this and other states, the law makes railroad corporations liable for the death of a passenger, caused by a &amp;quot;wrongful act, neglect or default&amp;quot; on the part of such company or any of its agents; the language of the law in most cases following that of &amp;quot;Lord Camp- bell&apos;s act.&amp;quot; But in no one of the states, so far as we are able to learn, are the benefits of such a provision extended to any employé of any such company. In the case of Chamberlin v. Milwaukee and Mississippi R. R. Co., in 7th Wisconsin, p. 426, it was held that a servant of a railway company cannot maintain an action for inju- ries occasioned by the negligence of other servants of the company. In the same case, however, reported in 11th Wisconsin, p. 240, this doctrine was denied, Justice Paine delivering the opinion; Justice Cole declining to express any opinion on the question. In Mose- ley v. Chamberlin, the court, Chief Justice Dixon delivering the opinion, and Justice Paine dissenting, overruled 11th Wisconsin and decided that one employé cannot recover for an injury occa- sioned by the negligence of another employé engaged in the same business. In this latter case, Chief Justice Dixon states that this doctrine is sustained by the almost unanimous judgments of all the courts both of England and this country. It was supposed that the other view had been or would be maintained by the courts of Ohio and Indiana, but recent decisions hold to the very opposite; so that now the case of 11th Wisconsin stands alone, in opposition to the decisions of both countries. Increased accountability on the part of the corporations would not merely secure relief to surviving relatives, in case of death caused by &amp;quot;wrongful act, neglect or default,&amp;quot; but would also tend to produce greater precaution against accident. Appropriate legislation on this subject cannot be too urgently recommended. CAREFUL AND FREQUENT INSPECTION. It must be evident to any one upon reflection that one very impor- tant means of preventing delay of trains and accidents, of every sort would be to provide for frequent and thorough inspection. &quot; &quot;50 Report of Railroad Commissioners. COMMISSIONER OSBORN TO J. L. ROOD. OFFICE OF RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS, J. L. ROOD, Esq., Monroe: MADISON, Oct. 17, 1874. DEAR SIR: Yours of the 16th is at hand. They have over-charged you. The distance from Oshkosh to Monroe is 136.1 miles: (102.4 x 137), the legal charge of a car load of lumber of 137 miles, $20.50. See sec. 5 of chap. 273: In computing the rate of carrying any freight according to the provisions of this act, the distance of carrying such freight shall be computed from where it is received, notwithstanding it may pass from one railroad to an- other.&amp;quot; I send you copy of the act. Very respectfully, JOSEPH H. OSBORN, Railroad Commissioner. J. L. ROOD TO COMMISSIONER OSBORN. J. H. OSBORN, R. R. Com&apos;r: MONROE, WIS., Oct. 19, 1874. Your letter is received.

R. from Oshkosh to Janesville, and then from Janesvile, by M. &amp;amp; St. P. R. R. to Monroe. I have been paying these rates of freight (under protest), on about fifty cars. I would like to know if there is any other way to correct this matter than for me personally to sue the railroad company, or whether it is in the power of the Railroad Commissioners to correct this matter. Can the com- panies refuse to carry other cars than their own on their respective roads? Please answer and oblige, J. L. ROOD. COPY OF MR. BRITT&apos;S LETTER TO MR. ROOD. CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE AND ST.

But the plan more especially referred to above, is different from this; being, namely, to leave the matter of rates of charges for transportation of freight wholly to the companies, turning the sur- plus into the public treasury. To this plan there are some serious objections: First-The tendency of such a system would be to induce a cov- ering up of real &apos;profits, or the charging to capital what correct principles require should be charged to net earnings. Secondly-In the case of companies able to earn the maximum of profit, the effect of an absolute limit would be to remove one of the most powerful incentives to economy, and, in that degree, to lead to extravagance in expenditures. Thirdly-It would tend to encourage an increase of capital stock, no matter what the restraints put upon the practice of &amp;quot;watering.&amp;quot; Fourthly-Even if these objections could be overcome, and the whole possible surplus of profits could be turned into the public treasury, there would still remain this further objection, namely, that to the extent of a large proportion of the surplus, the state would be imposing a tax upon productive industry, compelling the productive classes, through payment of excessive charges, to bear more than their share of the public burdens. Another method of applying the principle of limitation of prof- its, and a less objectionable one, would be, to fix a somewhat lower maximum of profit and provide for a division, as in France, of the surplus, between the state and the companies. This would also be open to the objection last above named, but would have the advan- tage of leaving to the companies a pecuniary inducement to econ- omy after the maximum had been reached. The most of these objections would be removed were a limitation of profits accompanied by an appraisal of actual property, as sug- gested and discussed in another part of this report. PUBLICITY OF RATES OF FREIGHT. Of great practical importance in this connection would &quot; &quot;Attempts to Solve the Railway Problem. 81 laws are working with but little friction, and that there is much less agitation of the railway question there than in the northwestern states. 6. The railway question in Michigan. Thus far, Michigan has followed almost exactly in the foot-steps of Ohio. An act was passed in April, 1873, creating the office of commissioner and that officer submitted his first report at the close of the same year. The law gives the commissioner ample powers for the inspection of the roads, to require reports of the railway companies, and to prosecute for violations of laws relating to railways, in the name of the people of the state of Michigan. The law fixes a maximum charge of three cents a mile for passengers on all but the newer and weaker roads, some of which, as in the Peninsula, are allowed to charge five cents per mile. The recommendations of the commissioner are adverse to any attempt of the legislature to establish rates for the transportation of freight. 7. The railway question in Minnesota. The question of cheap transportation is one of so much impor- tance to Minnesota, by reason of her immense production of grain, and her remoteness from the eastern markets, that the agitation of railway reforms commenced even earlier there than in states further east. The first law passed with a view to future control of railway companies was enacted in 1871. It closely resembled the Ohio law, and like it provided for the appointment of a single com- missioner with duties limited almost entirely to the collection of statistical information and an anual report thereof to the legisla- ture. This law did not satisfy the people, however, and after three years another was enacted, providing for three commissioners in- stead of one, and imposing upon them the duty of classifying freights and establishing rates of transportation. As the report of these commissioners is not yet received, it is too early to speak of the success of the experiment. 8. The Railway question in Illinois. In the state of Illinois the subject of railway transportation has been much agitated for many years. Conventions held at various times and places have discussed the matter and sought to secure 6-R. R. &quot; &quot;70 Appendix. essential rights or privileges which the charter confers. In short, they must be police regulations in fact, and not amendments of the charter in curtail- ment of the corporate franchise.&amp;quot; Cooley&apos;s Const. Law, 577. The fixed limitations of toll in chapter 273, if applied to the territorial franchise, would limit tolls under the latter whether the fixed rates be rea- sonable or not. And we think that we have sufficiently explained the con- flict between the two, to show that the state act does essentially limit a right which the territorial charter confers. The very point which arises here has not, so far as we are aware, been pass- ed upon by the supreme court of the United States. But the principle gov- erning it has been in many cases. We shall not attempt to review the cases. We will only say that a court, which has several times held that state relin- quishment of the sovereign right of taxation in favor of a corporation, is a valid contract which the state cannot impair by resumption of the right to tax, is not to be expected to sustain, such a substantial impairment of a fran- chise to take toll, which, at its worst, could affect no public power of the state, and could only be abused by individual extortion. And, in view of all their decisions, and in submission to them, we feel bound to hold the territorial charter of 1847, enlarged by the territorial act of 1848, to be a contract within the prohibition of the federal constitution, the obligation of which the state can pass no law to impair; and that the provisions of chapter 273 of 1874, limiting the tolls of railroads, operated by the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Company, if applied to the road from Milwaukee to Prairie du Chien, built under that charter, would impair the obligation of the contract of that charter; and that, therefore, those provisions of chapter 273 do not apply to that road. If, indeed, that charter was not accepted, and the corporation under it was not organized before the adoption of the state constitution, a grave question would arise of the effect of the reserved power in the state constitution upon the charter accepted and the corporation organized, after that instrument had gone into operation. But that question is not here, and we express no opin- ion on it. VIII. Before the commencement of the argument an objection was made to the hearing of these motions on the verified informations of the Attorney General, unsupported by affidavit. We hold, on the authority of the Attorney General v. Cahoes Co., 6 Paige, 133, and other cases, that an information of the Attorney General ex-officio, acting under the sanction of his oath of office, is equivalent to a bill in chancery verified on information and belief. Like such a bill, it will call, in proper cases, for answer under oath. But, as in case of such a bill, an injunction will not usually go upon it, unsupported by positive affidavit, until after the defendant has had the opportunity to contradict it on oath, and has failed to do so. We say this now only for the purpose of settling the practice. In these cases the difficulty was cured by affidavits filed by the Attorney General be- fore the motions were heard, which the defendants, had leave to answer, of which they declined to avail themselves. These affidavits, uncontradicted, establish what we presume that defendants denied only pro forma, the disregard of the maximum rates of toll prescribed by chapter 273 of 1874. Indeed some of the affidavits filed by the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Company admit the violation of that rule of rates, and some of those filed by the Chicago and Northwestern Company very forcibly imply a similar violation. We, therefore, take the fact to be undis- puted. IX. These views substantially dispose of these motions. A moving ap. peal was made to us on the argument, if we shonld sustain these informa- tions, to withhold the writs in our discretion. The appeal was such and so made as could not fail to leave a deep impression on our minds. It was founded on very strong affidavits of the injurious effects to these defendants and to the public interest in their well doing, which it was feared would re- sult from the enforcement of the rates of toll prescribed by the statute. These affidavits are entitled to great respect. They are not the affidavits of speculators, at a distance, in the affairs and control of these railroads, reputed &quot; &apos;Evils of Railway Construction and Management. 61 There is reason to hope that the grants more recently con- firmed to this state, or expected to be confirmed, and which have been bestowed by the legislature upon the Wisconsin Central, the West Wisconsin and the North Wisconsin companies, will be hon- estly applied; but the state could, nevertheless, with propriety, cor- rect past omissions by throwing some sort of safeguard around the interest of the people in those grants. MISMANAGEMENT OF RAILROADS IN OPERATION. It were well did the evil of mismanagement confine itself to the period of construction. On the contrary, however, it too often appears that the business of building roads for private advantage, so far from satisfying the managers, has only served as a prepara- tory training for the sharp practice to be followed afterwards. 1. Private gains at cxpense of company and public. It is well understood by all who are familiar with railroad man- agement, that there are many ways in which officers can, if so in- clined, accumulate fortunes without using capital of their own, and wholly at the cost of stockholders. Among them, is the use of company funds for the handling of grain and produce; paying therefor a price enough higher than unaided buyers can afford to pay, to give them the command of the market, and shipping the same over their own lines free of charge, or at nominal charges. Another is, to arrange with buyers privately to carry their ship- ments at a price next to nothing-dividing the profits. Practices like these are believed to be common, and help to ac- count for the rapidity with which railway officials sometimes grow rich on moderate salaries. They also suggest the reason why rail- roads are sometimes made to facilitate the commercial growth and prosperity of one town or village to the great disadvantage, per- haps total ruin, of another. If private speculations on the part of railway managers are not discovered in all such cases, it is more than likely because pains have been taken to conceal them. The same sort of evils appear in another guise, and on a larger scale, where a private inside &quot;ring&quot; is formed for the pur- chase of lands, mines, docks and harbors, and the sale of them for a large advance to the company the &quot;ring&quot; officially represents. The stockholders are duly advertised of the great importance of the property to the future of the road, while congratulating them &apos; &quot;126 Report of Railroad Commissioners. holders attending an annual meeting, asking explanation of matters contain- ed in the report (or not contained in it); finding fault with this, that and the other; proposing resolutions about one matter or another, would, we imagine, utterly amaze most of our veteran railroad directors. No that shareholders here always put up with the policies of their directors; they get tired of them and turn them out quite as frequently as any other shareholders, probably, bnt they do it, and are expected to do it quietly, almost secretly, giving no reasons that the public ever have for their action, and asking no explanation or defense from those who they displace or seek to displace. ors. Al- &amp;quot;Now in England, the directors publish and send to the shareholders a report for the preceding half-year, at least a week before the half-yearly meet- ing. The shareholders, therefore, come to this meeting with a knowledge of what their directors have done, and of the results of the working of their railroad. They have time to study the returns and compare them with those for previous half-years, and the results with those anticipated by the direct- Then at the meeting the chairman, apparently invariably, makes a speech, usually much longer than the report itself, in which he explains the report, sets forth the policy pursued and that proposed for the future, and usually submits some questions to the shareholders for their decision. most always some shareholders have remarks to make, often in approval and often in criticism of some action of the board or statement of the report, and oftener still in the way of inquiry for explanation of something in the report or the president&apos;s speech; or perhaps it is a request for entirely new informa- tion. Frequently there are a great many speakers and a long debate-per- haps a hot one-and the chairman holds himself bound to answer all inqui- ries and make all explanations. Thus the meetings often draw out a great deal of valuable information regarding the company&apos;s affairs. They make it possible for any shareholder, not absolutely stupid, to understand the affairs of his company, the policies which control it, and the different courses recommended by different parties. The very institution by which he main- tains his close control of his company keeps him informed concerning it, makes him interested in it, and does much to qualify him for the part which he takes in directing its affairs. Another good result is that the public can, if it chooses, keep informed of the motives which determine changes in the management of the corporate property, feel the pulses of the shareholding public, and realize the importance of the corporate interest and the reasona- bleness of its efforts to secure a good income on its investment. Civilized people-Anglo-Saxons, at least-have a hearty, honest sympathy with people who are trying to get an honest living. When they see and hear the army of shareholders struggling to make their property as efficient and as valuable as possible, they are likely to wish them success; but when they hear only of the Boston and Albany Company, the Central Pacific Company, they hardly associate the corporation with human beings with rights and wants like them- selves, but rather imagine it as a cold-blooded abstraction-a modern mon- ster which devours the substance which ought to support good warm flesh and blood. &amp;quot;The tendency of the past eight or ten years, in this country, has been to &quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;172 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

A fair method would be to treat the cost per mile of carrying as being the same regardless of distance, the train being once under headway, and then to add to it the cost of checking up and start- ing-where the train need not of necessity stop either for wood or water, or for the comfort of the through passengers-and also the difference justly chargeable for the use of the stations, and the printing and selling the requisite tickets. Where, however, the through train is a fast train, with more elegant and comfortable coaches, and the accommodation train is composed of inferior cars, and run at a slower rate of speed, due regard should be had to the saving made in the case of the slow accommodation train, and to the greater cost of equipment and greater damage done to track and rolling stock by the fast through train. Where the traffic has a wholesale character, as is often the case between large cities and neighboring villages, rates will very prop- erly bear a further reduction, and perhaps assume the character of commutation or season rates. It is believed that due regard to these principles, as well as to the practicability of greatly increasing a passenger traffic in many cases by special inducements, the railway companies would better accommodate the public, and undoubtedly increase their own profits. INDIRECT LIMITATION OF CHARGES BY LIMITATION OF PROFITS. On account of the difficulty of fixing even maximum rates that will be just to both people and corporations, it has been suggested that the state might determine some definite per cent. on the capi- tal invested that shall be considered the maximum profit. It has been noticed that in several countries of the old world, both maximum rates and a maximum of profit are established; the maximum rates being changed from time to time, so as to keep the profits down to the allowable point. Should maxima be adopted, it would be imperative, as a matter of prudence and justice, that the rates should be most carefully determined after a full and thorough investigation of all matters essen- &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 239 1856, as granted such portion of the grant to the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, was repealed. By chapter 117 of the private and local laws of 1870, approved 25th Feb., 1870, the portion of the Sugar River Valley Railroad Company between the Milwaukee and Prairie du Chien Railway and Portage City, was incorporated as the Madison and Portage Railroad Company, and the 9th of August, 1870, a deed was issued by the President of the Sugar River Valley Railroad Com- pany to the Madison and Portage Railroad Company. The Madison and Portage Company absorbed the &amp;quot;Portage, Friendship, Grand Rapids and Stevens Point Railroad Company,” and Dec. 6, 1871, the Madison and Portage and Rockford Central, of Illinois, were consolidated under the name of the &amp;quot;Chicago and Superior Railroad Company.&amp;quot; Art. 9, of this agreement, reads thus: &amp;quot;The claim of the present Madison and Portage Railroad Company to a land grant for the section of said road from Madison to Portage if at any time allowed by the department or congress in whole or in part, shall belong to such section exclusively, the same having been used in the construction thereof. It is hereby understood and agreed that all property and right of property growing out of said land grant is now vested in the owners (legal and equitable) of the “Land Grant Scrip&apos; - (so called), heretofore issued by the Madison and Portage Railroad Company; that the said company has ex- ecuted an instrument purporting to convey in trust for such scrip holders all right, title and interest in and to the lands aforesaid.&amp;quot; 99 The distance from Madison to Portage is 39 miles, and at six sections per mile, the quantity of land applicable to this portion of the land grant route, would be 149,760 acres. CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY. From Fond du Lac Northerly to the State Line. By chapter 137, of the general laws of 1856, approved 11th of October, 1856, this grant was conferred upon &amp;quot;the Wisconsin and Superior Railroad Company.&amp;quot; It subsequently came into the possession of what is now known as the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company. By a joint resolution, April 25, 1862, the word &amp;quot;northerly &amp;quot; was construed to mean within ranges sixteen to twenty-three, inclusive, east of the fourth meridian, and the line of the railroad which had been located, was author- ized to be changed to within those limits, but at the same time the lands were authorized to be selected along the route of the road as it had been originally lo- cated. By the same resolution the state was authorized to select from the &amp;quot;Fort Howard Military Reservation, eighty acres of land, to aid a railroad from Ap- pleton to Green Bay. By a joint resolution, May 20, 1868, a patent for this eighty acres of the &amp;quot;Fort Howard military reserve,” was directed to be issued to the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company. &quot; &quot;48 Report of Railroad Commissioners. use these advantages for the promotion of selfish, rather than public er.ds. On the other hand, it is no less apparent that the great public to be served by railways, feeling the necessity of better facilities for transportation, were at first ready to make almost any conces- sion to secure them; trusting to the self-interest of railway com- panies, and to the natural laws that control a free commerce, for protection against extortionate tolls. Nor is it strange that, under these circumstances, they have, in many instances, been ready to unite their smaller resources with the larger ones of the capitalists, and even make great sacrifices to secure the construction of roads that seemed otherwise impossible or in danger of indefinite post- ponement; or that, notwithstanding the ill success of such trials of natural-law security, yet other communities have been willing to make repetition of these experiments. And yet the futility of a reliance on such means of security is now apparent. SELF-INTEREST AS A RELIANCE. To a considerable extent, the interests of the railroad corpora- tions and the public are in harmony-very much more really so than the corporations appear to believe, if we may judge from the policy they so often pursue. Thus, it is clearly for the real inter- est of the corporations to build good and safe roads, and upon lines that will accommodate the largest number of people and the great- est amount of traffic; and yet, practically, they not unfrequently disregard both these elements of success, and are found building very poor roads, at full cost to the stockholders, and on lines which accommodate the public less than they should. It is for their real interest to encourage the agricultural industry of a country tributary to their roads, by affording cheap facilities for the trans- portation of the products it may be made to yield under the stimu- lus of prospective rewards for the requisite labor; and yet, in some cases, they adopt tariffs which practically prevent production. It is for the real interest of railroad companies to encourage the building up of flourishing manufacturing villages along their lines by supplying the raw material and carrying away the products of their industry at as low a rate as possible; but how often do they pursue a course actually prohibitive of such new enterprises, and deadening to those that already exist! It is sometimes for their real interest to develop new commercial points, which, by their &quot; &apos;Errors of Past Legislation. 93 sioal character, as well as the fair name and future prosperity of the commonwealth. It was in full view of these responsibilities of the state that we commenced our labors; and it is but just to our- selves and to the interests we have undertaken to represent, that we express to the legislature in this connection our belief in the impossibility of a judicious final settlement of all those questions in a few months, or in a single year. What the wisest men of many countries have been engaged upon for a whole generation, with but partial success, we can hardly hope to settle at once in Wisconsin. We should be nearer a solution than were any inquirers in the past, for the reason that we have the benefit of all past experience. But, even with this advantage, it is needful that our hope be tempered with much caution, and that we consider the commission as having but entered upon a series of pro- longed and difficult labors. 66 FAULTS OF THE POTTER LAW.&quot; For Probably the ablest opponents of the law would fail to make a case should they attempt to establish the fact of its responsibility for all the misfortunes and financial embarrassments which have overtaken the railroads of the whole country, or even of Wisconsin. these are mainly due to quite other causes, as any unprejudiced mind may see-to general stagnation of business; to the financial troubles which of late have overtaken commercial enterprises in nearly all parts of the world; to the general unsoundness conse- quent on the freedom of speculation during recent years; and to the reaction from the mania for building roads, with but little re- gard to the real necessities of industry, which has come, at lengtlı, and more suddenly than was expected. Still, it cannot be denied that the law is really obnoxious to just criticism, even if the objects aimed at are allowed to be in themselves desirable. The more notable faults are these: 1. It bears heavily on the new roads. In the consideration of this question, we are not to forget how much the present and future development of the state is dependent upon the construction of new and the extension of old lines of railway. And while we most earnestly urge such judicious legisla- tion as shall protect the public and the owners of railway capital alike from the evils of mismanagement, we cannot appreciate the &apos; &apos;Papers and Documents Accompanying this Report. 45 such as the Railroad Commissioners of Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin have agreed in conference should be made by the rail- road companies in each of these three states. GENERAL STATISTICS. For their own convenience, as well as for the information of the public, they have prepared for publication, in addition to the sta- tistics of cost, earnings and indebtedness of railway companies, a number of statements and tables of general interest-such as com- parative statistics of the mileage and cost of the United States and all other countries; statistics of congressional, municipal and farm-mortgage aid granted in aid of railroad construction in Wis- consin; tables illustrating the bearing of the present law upon the cost of transportation on our railways, and comparative showings of &quot;Potter Law&quot; rates, and the rates on other railroads of the country, east and west. Had time and space permitted, many other statistics of much interest and value would have been added. DIGEST OF RAILWAY LAWS, REVISION AND CODIFICATION. Owing to the great number of the laws relating to railroads which have been enacted by the territorial and state legislatures, the frequent occasion for reference thereto, and the labor involved in making searches for them in more than a score of volumes, the commissioners have added to their necessary labors the very con- siderable one of abstracting or digesting and arranging in chrono- logical order, under head of the railways concerned, the numerous laws creating railway corporations and defining their powers. In performing this task, some laws have been found which should be repealed. A repeal of all acts of incorporation not presently accepted and in force, and a revision and codification of the re- mainder, during the ensuing year, would tend to simplify and equalize legislation, and is respectfully recommended. Your attention is called particularly to the provisions of chapter 48, laws of 1871. In effect, this chapter authorizes subscriptions of stock by towns and cities, at the ultimate cost of the state. It is not possible to presume that the present legislature desires to perpetuate this method of depreciating the receipts of the state treasury. THE APPENDIX TO THE REPORT. In order that there might be preserved a history of the import- &apos; &quot;40 Appendix. way act of 1840 (3 and 4 Vict., ch. 97), and the railway act of 1844 (7 and 8 Vict., ch. 85.) Section 11 of the former of these two latter acts, and section 17 of the latter of them, the second of these sections being a substitute for the first, give certain authority to the board of trade to require the attorney gen- eral to proceed against railway companies for violation of legal duty; and, upon such requistion, make it obligatory on the attorney general to take such proceedings. While the latter of these sections was in force, the attorney general filed an information in the court of chancery against a railway com- pany for an injunction against acts within the letter and spirit of the section, without any requisition of the board of trade. On application for injunction, the Vice Chancellor says; 66 It is, however, contended that as the act of 7 and 8 Vict., ch. 85, sections 16, 17, prescribes a particular remedy in such a case, the Attorney General cannot take proceedings otherwise than in accordance with that provision. &amp;quot;This objection in truth involves the contention that this court has no ju- risdiction to entertain the suit by the Attorney General, unless it is instituted under the circumstances mentioned in those sections. &amp;quot;The effect of those sections is not to take away the right of the Attorney General to file such an information at his discretion, although there is no cer- tificate of the Board of Trade, or the jurisdiction of the court to entertain such a suit. The only effect is that if the Board of Trade has certified to the Attorney General, he is bound to act, and compel the railway company to ab- stain from doing what is in violation of the law. In that particular case he can exercise no discretion; he must sue.&amp;quot; The information was sustained and the injunction issued. Attorney Gen- eral v. Great W. Railway Co., 1 Drewry &amp;amp; S., 154. We have been unable to find any English statute enlarging the jurisdic- tion of the Court of Chancery in such cases; and we find all the English cases proceeding without reference to statutory jurisdiction. We find no room for doubt that this jurisdiction of English Courts of Equity is inde- pendent of all authority by statute, and has long been as well recognized as any ground of equitable jurisdiction whatever. And these views are fully sustained by the case just quoted. We cannot state the rule better than by taking it from the excellent work of Mr. Brice, so recently given to the profession: &amp;quot;Under many circumstances, the court of chancery has, on public grounds, jurisdiction to prevent corporations acting in various ways, or contrary to the intent for which they have been created. The public, however, must be represented in all applications relating to such matters, and this is done by the intervention of the Attorney General. No single person, whether a mem- ber of the corporation in question or not, is able on his own account, and of own motion, to call upon the court to interfere for his special protection. The wrong he complains of is not confined to himself—no right or privilege pecu- liar to himself is violated-the wrongs inflicted and the rights invaded affect the public, and the public, consequently, must be a party to the proceedings. The occasion upon which the court will exercise jurisdiction to restrain the doing of acts of this kind, seem to fall into the three following heads.&amp;quot; The author then proceeds to give the three heads of jurisdiction at large, which are thus classed in his own words: &amp;quot;1st. When a corporation is abusing powers given for public purposes; 2d, or is committing a breach of trust; 3d, or is acting adversely to public policy.&amp;quot; We copy this last in full: &amp;quot;When any corporation is doing acts detrimental to the public welfare, or hostile to public policy. The right of the Attorney General to interfere on these grounds was fully established in Attorney General v. Great North. Rail- way Co., where the defendants had engaged in an illegal trade in coals. It was objected that it was not competent for him to file an information. But Kindersley, V. C., said: &apos;On this point I entertain no doubt whatever. When- ever the interests of the public are damnified by a company established for any particular purpose by act of Parliament, acting illegally and in contra- vention of the powers conferred upon it, I conceive it is the function of the Attorney General to protect the interests of the public by an information; and that, when in the case of an injury to private interests, it would be com- petent for an individual to apply for an injunction to restrain a company from using its powers for purposes not warranted by the act creating it, it is &quot; &quot;Records of Railway Companies. 153 the amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000), as indicated on the margin of the above copy.

Just what should be required of the corporations in this regard is now receiving the careful con- sideration of your commissioners. PUBLICITY OF CONTRACTS. (1) Publicity of working and traffic contracts.-As a further means to the end of fair and efficient management, it is important that the state should be in possession of authenticated copies of all contracts between companies for the working of their lines respect- ively, and for the interchange of traffic; that the traffic arrange- ments made in pursuance of such contracts should also be made public at the several stations where they would be of use; and that the commission, or other state authority should be empowered to procure their amendment, or, if necessary, their supervision by due process of law. There should also be: (2) Publicity, through the commission, of all contracts between railroad companies, whether with one another, with express and telegraph companies, or with companies operating colored freight lines, or water lines. (3) Publicity, through the commission, of all agreements, leases, purchases and conveyances. FINAL LIMITATIONS UPON CORPORATE POWER. In the suggestion of remedial measures thus far, we have pur- posely advanced from the more palpable and less serious remedies to the more unusual; holding in reserve such as deal directly with the fundamental questions relating to chartered powers, organiza- tion, the prerogatives of members and officers, the issue of stock, and the creation of debt. THE RELATION OF STOCKHOLDERS TO MANAGERS. The progress of railroad enterprise in England has been charac- terized by the same features that have been shown in this country, and is thus described in a late journal: &quot;The railway system thus extended with unhealthy rapidity, until the in- &apos; &quot;138 Appendix. aforesaid on the Saint Croix river or lake to the west end of Lake Superior, and from any point on said last aforesaid route to Bayfield, together with such lands within fifteen miles of the line or route of said road or roads as shall be selected in pursuance of said act of congress in lieu of any sections or parts of sections which shall have been sold by the United States to which the right of pre-emption has attached. But it is hereby expressly understood between the parties hereto, that the said La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company possesses and does not surrender or release the right of selecting any lands within fifteen miles of and more than six miles from the route of the said road or roads between the St. Croix river or lake and the west end of Lake Superior; and, also, between the said route and Bayfield, for the pur- pose of making up any deficiency which does or may exist in the quantity of lands to which the said La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company is or may be entitled upon that point of its line extending from Madison to the St. Croix river or lake. And the said party of the second part hereby covenants and agrees to con- struct said railroads between the points to be designated by the party of the first part as atoresaid, and the west end of Lake Superior and to Bayfield, within ten years from the 3d day of June, 1856, and said roads are to be of the first class, with T rail, and in every respect as good as the La Crosse &amp;amp; Milwaukee Railroad. And the said party of the first part, in consideration as aforesaid, further covenants and agrees to construct and run its entire line of railroads to a point on the St. Croix river or lake, to be designated as aforesaid by said party of the first part, or to some convenient point easterly therefrom, so as to connect with a railroad from such point on the St. Croix river or lake to the west end of Lake Superior, and so as to make a terminus thereof at the point as afore- said on the St. Croix river or lake. And the said party of the second part for, and in consideration of the cove- nants and agreements, herein contained, on the part of the said party of the first part, has sold and granted, and does hereby sell, grant, assure and confirm unto the said party of the first part, free of all costs, charges and compensa- tions, the fuil and equal right forever of so much of its line of railroad as shall extend easterly from said terminal point on the St. Croix river or lake to the aforesaid point of intersection to enable the said party of the first part to make a terminus of its railroad at the point as aforesaid on the St. Croix river or lake. And the said party of the second part, in consideration as aforesaid, does further covenant and agree, to and with the party of the first part, that it will pay to the state of Wisconsin, on or before the first day of March in each year, four per centum of the gross earnings of said road in the year ending on the last day of the preceding December, in place of taxes on that part of said railroad hereby conveyed, as is provided by the acts of the legislature aforesaid, and also carry on, perform and obey all and singular the conditions, obligations and resolutions expressed or implied in any acts of the legisla- ture aforesaid which has been passed and which would be binding upon the said party of the first part to do and perform, so far as the said railroad, from a point as aforesaid, on the St. Croix river or lake, between townships twenty- five and thirty-one, to the west end of Lake Superior; and, also, from any point on said last aforesaid route to Bayfield may be referred to or concerned in the acts aforesaid, as if this deed of indenture had not been executed; and at all times the proper officers and agents of the state of Wisconsin shall have free access to, and the right of examining the books of the said party of the second part for the purpose of ascertaining the gross amount of earnings of the roads of the said party of the second part, and the amount of money to be paid to the state of Wisconsin in accordance with the acts of the legislature aforesaid. And, for securing to the state the afore- said per centum, it is hereby declared that the state shall have a lien upon the said railroad within the limits aforesaid, and upon all other property, estate and effects of the said party of the second part, whether real, personal or mixed, and said lien shall take and have precedence of all demands, decrees and judgments against said party of the second part. And the said parties hereto mutually covenant and agree, that they will form running connections with each other, and such as will best promote, as &quot; &quot;The Problem to be Solved. 67 ment, including Sir Robert Peel and other distinguished statesmen, reported against the practicability of this form of competition, de- clared in favor of a single management for each railway, and sug- gested the necessity to protect the public interests, in view of the important fact that the interest of the companies was to a certain extent only, that of the public.&amp;quot; It was not until 1844 that competition between separate lines of railways seems to have gained public attention. A committee then appointed, with Mr. Gladstone as chairman, had the whole subject of competition and general management under consideration for some time; making five successive reports, the third one embodying the following important conclusions:* That the indefinite conces- sions made to the earlier companies had become unnecessary; that competition between railways would do more harm to the compa- nies than good to the public; that the effect of monopoly, however, both on the public directly, and indirectly on the railway companies, was to be dreaded and guarded against; and that with regard to new lines, at any rate, the government and parliament should re- serve certain powers to be exercised after a time. It is apparent from the reports of a date even earlier than this, that the fear of monopolies and hence of consolidation (“amalga- mation&amp;quot;) of railways had taken deep root in the public and legis- lative mind-a hold it maintains to this day. The final report of the Gladstone committee quite fully discusses the question how to secure, by subsequent legislation,&amp;quot; the great- est amount of accommodation at the least cost;&amp;quot; the general con- clusion being that regulation was to be depended on rather than competition. The fruit of these reports was the passage of a law in 1844, con- taining these as the chief provisions relating to rates and fares, and to state purchase, to wit: &amp;quot;1. If after 21 years, any new railway has made 10 per cent. for three years, Treasury may reduce rates, but are to guarantee 10 per cent. The revised rates and the guarantee to continue for 21 years. &amp;quot;2. After 15 years, Treasury may buy any new railway for 25 years&apos; pur- chase of the average annual profits for the preceding three years; but if the profits are less than 10 per cent., the amount to be settled by arbitration. &amp;quot;3. No railway less than five miles in length to be bought; and no branch to be bought without buying whole railway. &amp;quot;4. Recites that the policy of revision or purchase is not to be prejudged; *Parliamentary Committee&apos;s Report (1872), page v. &quot; &quot;Official Papers and Correspondence. 57 Freight Agent of the N.

H. PORTER, TO THE COMMISSIONERS. CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN RAILWAY, Office of the General Manager, CHICAGO, October 26, 1874. GENTLEMEN: Your letter to the President of this company, of October 23, has been received, and I am directed to reply that he is very much obliged to you for informing him of Mr. Obrecht&apos;s complaint, so as to give an opportu nity of stating the facts as they really occurred. About the 16th day of October, Mr. Obrecht called at our general freight office. He did not see Mr. Wheeler at all, as he says he did, but had a con- versation with a person in the office of Mr. Wheeler. He inquired whether this company proposed to transport his lumber from points on the West Wis- consin Railway to Baraboo &amp;quot; under the law.&amp;quot; He was distinctly told that the company would do so. Mr. Obrecht has not since the 1st day of October been charged a greater rate of freight than that prescribed by the Potter law. The trouble between him and this company is this: The person in charge of Mr. Obrecht&apos;s yard at Baraboo has persistently and unreasonally neglected and refused to unload the cars promptly, thereby subjecting the company to the loss of the use of its cars, at a great inconve- nience in making up its trains. The fact of the failure to unload the cars promptly can be substantiated by abundant proof. The question whether Mr. Obrecht should pay demurrage upon cars which were not unloaded within a reasonable time has been a subject of negotiation and controversy between him and some of the officers of this company. The business done for Mr. Obrecht by this company is done at a loss in any event, but the amount of the loss is unnecessarily increased by the fact that the the company cannot get its cars unloaded within a reasonable time. There is but one way for the com- pany to secure the prompt unloading of the cars by Mr. Obrecht, and that is to require him to pay freight in advance while he persisted in detaining the cars. Perhaps the statement of Mr. Obrecht that the company charged him higher rates than those named in the Potter Law grew out of the fact that he has repeatedly overloaded the cars which were furnished him, and in one case where he had put 26,000 lbs. of freight upon a car, instead of 20,000, he &quot; &quot;8 Report of Railroad Commissioners. THE COMMISSIONERS TO SUPERINTENDENT G. W. COBB. OFFICE OF THE RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS, MADISON, May 15, 1874. G. W. COBB, ESQ., Seperintendent Mineral Point Railroad: DEAR SIR:-We acknowledge with much pleasure your letters of May 9th and 12th, enclosing instructions to agents, and accompanied by pamphlets and published sheets, showing passenger tariff to take effect May 15, 1873, and and freight tariffs taking effect September 10, 1868, June 6, 1870, July 1st, 1873, and May 1st, 1874. Also tendering the commissioners and clerk of the board passes on your line, which we deem proper respectfully to decline. The commendable promptitude with which you have acted, coupled with the cheerfulness of your compliance with the spirit, and as we believe with the letter of the law, affords the commission encouragement to hope that a ma- jority of the railway companies of the state will in like manner comply with the provisions of chapter 273. Touching the particular matters of your local freight tariff, we ask your attention to section 6 of said chapter, which provides that no corporation, etc., doing, etc., any railroad business in Class &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; (to which your road be- longs) shall receive a greater or higher rate for carrying freight than was re- ceived by said company for carrying such freight on the first day of June, 1873. It so happens that none of the tariff sheets forwarded are of that date. When you have made sure that the tariff rates shown in MS., herewith re- turned, is not in excess of those charged June 1, 1873, you may know that you have complied with the law in respect to freight.

JOSEPH H. OSBORN, GEO. H. PAUL, JNO. W. Hoyt, Railroad Commissioners, Madison, Wis: GENTLEMEN: I have before me your communication of the 8th instant, wherein you propound to me certain interrogatories respecting the rates charged for transportation of freight over this company&apos;s road at present, and those charged on the first day of June, 1873; also, as to the classification of freight as now arranged. &quot; &quot;104 Report of Railroad Commissoners. cents, the winter average heing 44.4 per cent. higher than the summer aver&apos; age, when the competition of water transport was in full force. It may be supposed that the increase in the rail rates during the winter months is caused by the increased cost of transport during that season of the year, but this is true only to a very limited extent. The chief cause of this is the absence of competition by lake and canal. This is evident from the fact that although the cost of transportation by rail is not greater in October and November than in June and July, yet the average of the rates during the former months is 44.4 per cent. higher than the average of the rates during the latter months. The pressure of traffic during the months of October and November, here the facilities for transport by water are limited, in connection with the fact that the Erie Canal is at that time taxed to its utmost capacity, causes an ad- vance in the rates on the lake and on the canal, and the rail rates at once go up to about the average for the winter months,&amp;quot; In view of the foregoing, and of a multitude of other facts, which it is not important to quote, it must be apparent that the true policy of the state is to encourage the improvement and effi- ciency of all feasible water routes, both within our own state and between the western states and the seaboard. STATE SUPERVISION NOT FULLY TESTED. We have already expressed the opinion that for this country, and certainly for our own state, executive supervision of transportation matters is the best, if not indeed the only, practical method. We admit that it has not yet been so tested in the United States that its success can be considered as fully established; but the facts that it bears the test of reason, and that it has succeeded well elsewhere, under circumstances like our own, are warrant for the conclusion that it will succeed here also—not in just the form in which it has been applied in the European states, but in a form consonant with American ideas and institutions, as well as with the nature of the case and the conditions involved. It must be admitted by us that in the one or two instances in which state supervision has been attempted in other states, the result has not been all that was hoped. But, on the other hand, it must be admitted by any who deny its practicability, that there has as yet, been no complete trial of it anywhere in this country. Even in England, where the Parliament, the government, and the public agree as to its being the only feasible plan of holding the railway corporations to a proper accountability, its resources have not been fully brought out. &quot; &apos;Executive and Legal Documents. 15 urge any valid reason against legislation which merely limits the corporate power and restricts the privilege of charging higher rates for transportation than the legislature may deem just and equitable. But it is now claimed by those who propose to disregard the law of 1874, that, although the power re- served in the constitution to alter all acts creating corporations is in terms unlimited, this reserved power is still subject to certain latent limitations which it is the duty of the courts to recognize and define; that among the latent limitations one is to be found or created which prevents the legislature from reducing the charges for transporting passengers and freight below a reasonable compensation, The result of this doctrine would be practically to repeal the constitution of the state, so far as this clause is concerned, and to restore to corporations in this vital particular that exemption from legislative control secured to them by the Dartmouth College decision, and to guard against which the clause was incorporated into the constitution of the state. The power to alter is given, by the constitution, just as clearly as the power to repeal, and it is difficult to see why a limitation cannot as well be applied to the one as to the other. If the state may take away the franchise entirely, why may it not so regulate and control its exercise as to further the public purpose for which it was bestowed. Ordinarily the greater includes the less; here the lesser power is given in express terms. The legislature may &quot;alter,&quot; and this word must be given some signification different in sense or in degree from the power to repeal. It cannot be said to apply to the right of taxation and police regulation, for these are inherent in the state, applica- ble alike to individuals and corporations, in no way dependent on the clause of the constitution referred to. It must mean that the legislature may in its discretion, instead of taking the extreme and severe measure of repeal, exer- cise the lesser and milder right, and impose such restrictions and conditious upon the conduct of the affairs of the corporation, and so limit its charges as will best promote the object of its creation and prevent the abuse of the powers and privileges granted to it. The corporations cannot justly complain of this. They have accepted their charters subject to this express reservation, and having so accepted, they hold them upon the faith of the state only, taking care to deserve its favor or com- mand its justice by the manner in which they exercise the power conferred. If a wrong is done or a mistake made in the exercise of the reserved power, the aggrieved party must resort to the legislature for redress. This was the agreement created by the acceptance of the charter and the application for re- lief must be made to the tribunal selected by the contracting parties. The courts cannot interfere, for, says Chancellor Kent, &quot;the legality of the reser- vation cannot be questioned.&quot; Should the legislature refuse or fail to correct the wrong, no worse results could ensue to the corporation than would have followed from absolute repeal. But it is hardly to be supposed that the legis- lature would fail to respond to any application founded in justice. The people cannot fail to appreciate the necessity of railroads to the business and industrial interests of the state and to the convenience and prosperity of all its citizens. They do not desire any unwilling or uncompensated service from the railroads, nor will they consent that the state should be placed in a condition of servitude to the corporations.&quot; But if this limitation, that the rates fixed by the legislature must be reason- able, exist at all, it arises, not from the reservation of its construction, but rather out of the common law rule that in the absence of any legislative en- anctment on the subject, common carriers are bound to carry all freight and passengers which are offered at reasonable rates, and cannot discriminate un- justly between shippers. In my judgment it is impracticable to apply this common law rule to railroad corporations, as a substitute for legislative con- trol and regulation. The use of railroads has increased the business of transporting freight and passengers to immense proportions: it has brought about great and radical changes in the commerce and business of the country; it has created new and diverted old channels of trade, built cities and formed states. The gigantic corporations controlling the railroads of the country, with their great wealth and influence are practically placed beyond the reach of the common law ob- ligation, and this warrants the position that legislative control ought to be &apos; &apos;Decrees Confirming Reports of Sales. 91 entered in favor of said complainant, and against said railroad company, of all the mortgaged property mentioned in this bill, and embraced in said mortgage therein mentioned.

FREDRIC P. JAMES, Assignee of NEWCOMB CLEVELAND, VS. THE MILWAU- KEE AND MINNESOTA RAILROAD COMPANY. April 18, 1866. Blll of complaint filed. Newcomb Cleveland recovered a judgment against the La Crosse and Mil- waukee Railroad Company, October 7, 1857, in the United States Circuit Court for $111,727.71 damages, and $544.15 costs, and this judgment having been assigned to Fredric P. James, he brought this suit to have the eastern division of the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad sold under said judgment, it being the first lien. January 11. 1867, a decree of sale was entered—the sum of $98,801.51 being found due on said judgment. March 2, 1867, the marshal sold, the following described premises under said decree, to wit: All and singular the railroad formerly known as the La Crosse and Mil- waukee Railroad from Milwaukee to Portage City, its depots, station houses and buildings, together with all its rolling stock, franchises and appurten- ances now in the possession of or claimed by the defendant, the Milwaukee and Minnesota Railroad Company, including all the locomotive engines, cars, rolling stock and all the materials, tools, implements and utensils and other property belonging to said road from Milwaukee to Portage City, subject &apos; &quot;Official Papers and Correspondence. 67 has been unable to obtain the cars. Had our cars not been delayed by the course he saw proper to adopt, we should have continued to have furnished them, even at a sacrifice of other and more material business interests. For the purpose of avoiding any possible error in the position occupied by this company in the premises, let me ask, if, under the circumstances, we are obliged to furnish cars for through freight destined to points on another road, when it is beyond our power to control the movement of such cars while on such connecting roads? Again, will you please inform me whether we are (or not) obliged to re- spect the orders governing the movement of foreign cars-as received from their owners-while their cars are on our track, so far as it may be in our power so to do? Again, referring to your communication, I desire to here state that since the rendering of the unfavorable (to roads) opinion by the Supreme Court, we have endeavored by all means to avoid any act that could be construed as an evidence of disrespect to the law as endorsed by that decision, and we have tried to satisfy all persons that—no matter at what cost-we should carry out the provisions of the Potter Law until the same should be honorably modified, or until the management and proprietors of the road became hope- lessly bankrupt, and then the road would stop business, with a due notice to all concerned. If you will kindly reply to my two questions fully, you will much oblige me. Also please to point out any weakness you may observe in my under- standing of our rights and duties in the matter about which I have princi- pally written. We desire not only to conform to the law, so far as it can be properly un- derstood or explained, but we desire to satisfy the legal authorities, as well as the sovereign people, of our good intentions and good faith in the premises. An early reply is hoped for. Very respectfully yours, W. G. SWAN, Gen&apos;l Supt. M. PEDRICK vs. GREEN BAY AND MINNESOTA R. R. CO. Railroad Commissioners: FAIRCHILD, Wis., Oct. 20, 1874. GENTLEMEN: Enclosed, please find a letter to me from the general freight agent of the Green Bay and Minnesota Railroad Company. I wrote to them in reference to shipping to Minnesota, and this is the answer to my letter. The distance is less than seventy-five miles to Winona, which would make the freight $15 per car load, while the West Wisconsin Company charge $8 to Merrillan, and the Green Bay and Minnesota Company charge $19, making $27. I have already shipped, and they have charged at that rate. It is very annoying to try to do anything here when they persist in overcharging on every thing that we ship. &quot; &apos;Laws Relating to Railroads. 321 transported over said roads, under the direction of the postoffice department, at such price as congress may, by law, direct: provided, that until such price is fixed by law, the Postmaster-General shall have the power to determine the same.

RESOLUTION explanatory of and in addition to the act of June third, eight- een hundred and fifty-six, granting public lands to the state of Wisconsin to aid in the construction of railroads in said state. Resolved by the senate and house of representatives of the United States of America in congress assembled, That the word &quot;northerly,&quot; in the first sec- tion of of the act entitled &quot;an act granting public lands to the state of Wis- consin to aid in the construction of railroads in said state,&quot; approved June third, eighteen hundred and fifty-six, shall, without forfeiture to said state or its assigns of any rights or benefits under said act, or exemption from any of the conditions or obligations imposed thereby, be construed to authorize the location of the line of railroad in said first section provided for, upon any eligible route within ranges sixteen to twenty-three, inclusive, east of the fourth principal meridian. And the line of railroad as now located accord. ing to the records of the general land office in pursuance of said act, is here- by authorized to be changed to within the specified limits: Provided, how- ever, that upon the construction of said railroad upon the new line, or of a sufficient part thereof, according to the terms of said act, the state of Wis- consin, its grantees or assigns, shall receive upon the route originally lo- cated, and in the manner prescribed by the act, the same quantity of lands, and no more or other, except as hereinafter provided for, as it or they would have received if such railroad had been constructed upon the line originally located. SEC. 2. And be it further resolved, That there be and is hereby granted to the state of Wisconsin, for the purpose of aiding in the construction of a railroad from the town of Appleton in said state, to some point on Green Bay, at or near the mouth of Fox River, in said state, so much of the public lands of the United States lying at or near the mouth of said river, in the county of Brown and state of Wisconsin, known as the Fort Howard Mil- itary Reserve, as may be required for right of way, tracks, turn.outs, depots, workshops, warehouses, wharves, and other railroad uses, not exceeding eighty acres, to be so selected by the state of Wisconsin or her assigns as to exclude the fort therefrom: Provided, however, That if no railroad be con- structed and in running order between the termini in this section mentioned within three years from the passage of this joint resolution, then this grant shall be void. SEC. 3. And be it further resolved, That the Secretary of the Interior be and he is hereby, authorized to cause all even sections, or parts of even sec- tions, of public land that may be brought within six miles of the new line of railroad, as herein provided for, to be sold at the same price and in the same manner as those have been upon the originally located route of railroad. 21-R.

The compa- nies finding this agreement a hard one to fulfil, the government, by laws of 1859 and &apos;63, allowed them to issue bonds, itself guaranteeing 4.65 per cent. interest thereon for 50 years, the 65 p. c. becoming a sinking fund. The receipts from the old or main lines were calcu- lated, and a sum per kilometre definitely proportioned to the in- come, was fixed, which each company might apply to its operating expenses, interest on bonds, dividends on stock, and any difference the company might have to pay between the interest guaranteed and the interest to be paid. Any excess beyond this fixed sum was applicable to any deficiency arising from the working of the new lines. If after such application of the excess, a deficiency should still exist, the government was to make it good to the extent of its guaranty. Any advance by the government to be treated as a loan, repayable with 4 per cent. simple interest. The amount of aid which had been given to railway companies up to 1864, is shown below.

MANITOWOC AND MISSISSIPPI RAILROAD. The company was incorporated March 15, 1851, with authority to construct a railway from Manitowoc to La Crosse, about 180 miles. March 11, 1854, the legislature authorized the company to construct a branch from any point east of the 4th principal meridian to the Minnesota state line. The first board of directors was elected in October, 1853. The line was first located from Manitowoc to Menasha, and the estimated cost of this division in 1854, in- cluding 5 locomotives, 8 passenger cars, 3 baggage cars and 50 freight cars, was $924,326, or $22,008 per mile. The resources of the company at the same date were: individual subscriptions to stock, $100,000; 7 per cent. bonds of Menasha, in exchange for stock, $150,000; 7 per cent. bonds of Manitowoc, in exchange for stock, $150,000; first mortgage bonds on the road at $10,000 per mile, $420,000, leaving a deficiency of about $120,000, necessary to cover costs and all contingencies. SUGAR VALLEY RAILROAD COMPANY. In Chartered in March, 1855. Company organized in March, 1856. October, 1856, the grading and masonry on that portion of the line between the Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad and Albany, a distance of 7¼4 miles was placed under contract. In 1857 the charter was so changed as to make Madison the northern terminous and extending the road southward to the state line. A charter was also obtained from the Illinois legislature for a connecting road from Freeport in that state. By an act of the Wisconsin legislature, approved April 12, 1861, the land grant assigned by act of October 11, 1856, to the La Crosse and Milwaukee Company, for the con struction of a railroad from Madison and from Columbus via Portage City to Bayfield, was declared forfeited, as far it referred to the portion of the road from Madison and Columbus to Portage City, and the charter to the Sugar Valley Union Railroad Company was extended to Portage City, and the lands belonging to that portion of the line were assigned to the Sugar Valley Union Company. On the first day of January, 1863, the grade 21.65 mlies was completed between Madison and Portage City, and the work was rapidly progressing on several sections. The right of way had been secured, for about 30 of the 36 miles, between Madison and Portage City, and depot grounds secured at Hart- man, Poynette and Windsor. On that portion of the road between Madison and the state line, depot grounds had been secured at Brodhead and Albany, the right of way procured, and the grading and bridging completed between the two points last named (8 miles), making in the aggregate nearly 40 miles of right of way procured, and 30 miles of grade completed-the whole length of line being about 80 miles. &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 159 MINERAL POINT RAILROAD.-Statement of Cost-from Reports of the Company.

Returns included in West Wisconsin Railroad report. &quot; &quot;Character and Present Condition of the Railroads. 43 The North Wisconsin has been vigorously pushed through, in fulfilment of the conditions imposed by the last legislature, and now has its northern terminus in section 7, town 33, range 14 west. From New Richmond north, it lies for the greater part of the dis- tance in a timbered region; the terminus itself in a quite dense primeval forest of hard wood, mixed with pine. It is of course impossible that this road should earn enough for some time to pay the expenses of operating it. But the valuable lands through which the line is projected, will insure its early ex- tension by sections of twenty miles, and its completion through to Bayfield at no very remote day. The road bears evidence of having been honestly built. The engineering was well done, in the first place, and the road-bed is one of the best in the state. Like the Wisconsin Valley, it is ironed with rail of 50-pound weight. It is the declared policy of the company to offer their lands at low prices and on terms that will, as far as possible, lead to their purchase by actual settlers who will develope the country along the line of the road. The Chippewa Falls and Western Railroad Company completed the section of their road, connecting Eau Claire with Chippewa Falls, on the last day of December; the first through train running over it on the 1st day of January, 1875. It gives railroad commu- nication with the rest of the world to one of the most enterprising manufacturing towns in the state, and must prove a great advantage to a large area of country around and beyond Chippewa Falls. The stock was taken by the people on the line, and the road was built at a cost of a little over $16,000 per mile, unequipped. The Galena and Southern Wisconsin Railroad is building under an old charter, and on the 1st day of this month (January), was opened through to Platteville. It is the first narrow-gauge road built in Wisconsin. Length of whole line, about thirty miles; length in Wisconsin, twenty miles. Capital stock, $650,000. Cost of road equipped, about $14,000 per mile. Amount of mortgage bonds, $10,000 per mile, or $300,000. The cost of building was considerably enhanced by the tightness of the money market, which made it necessary to sell the securities at a heavy discount. The Prairie du Chien and McGregor Railroad Transfer Company deserve mention in this connection as having, during the year, com- pleted what is considered the most remarkable and successful pon- &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 277 Oregon.. 19 19 19 19 61 Pennsylvania. 3,728 4,090 4,311 4,398 4,598 139 4,656 159 241 5,113 5,360 251 5,550 20.9 95, 274 379.5 149.1 46,000 8.2 Rhode Island. 125 125 125 125 127 136 136 136 159 3.9 1,306 8.2 South Carolina 1,000 1,007 1,007 1,076 1,101 1,139 1,261 1,290 1,320 48.5 34,000 25.7 Tennessee 1,296 1,296 1,358 1,436 1,451 1,492 1,520 1,520 1,620 81.0 45,600 27.7 Texas 465 471 513 533 533 711 865 1,078 1,578 78.9 274, 356 173.8 Vermont 587 587 587 605 614 614 675 710 721 22.4 10,212 14.1 Virginia. 1,401 1,442 1,464 1,464 1,483 1,486 1,490 1,537 1,573 55.2 38,352 24.3 West Virginia Wisconsin 365 1,010 365 365 365 387 387 1,036 1,036 1,235 1,512 1,525 485 1,725 561 576 20.8 23.000 39.9 1,878 2, 203 95.3 53, 924 24.4 157 328 483 603 200.7 140,000 232.1 Colorado • Dakota.

A COMMISSION WITH ADEQUATE POWERS. It is manifest that if the policy of state supervision of railways is to have permanency, it should also have efficiency. And it is no less manifest that there can only be efficiency where there is unity of purpose and sufficiency of authority. Your present commissioners do not covet added powers. Every personal consideration would lead them to an avoidance of in- creased responsibility. But they cannot honestly and fully dis- charge their duty to the state, as they understand it, without point- ing out what their investigations have led them to regard as abso- lutely essential to success in working out a practical solution of the transportation question. It has appeared in the foregoing discussion that specific rates of charges fixed by any authority independent of the railway compa- nies who have the responsibilities of management, are everywhere found to be impracticable-that statutory provisions for the control of a business so intricate, and involving such an infinite variety of particulars, must of necessity be practically worse than useless un- less broad and general in character, compelling observance of estab- lished principles, rather than imposing regulations for all the details of practical operations. It is no less manifest that any department or board charged with duties in this behalf should not only be charged with the general enforcement of all laws designed to pro- tect the transportation interests of the public, but should have the exercise of reasonable discretionary authority to apply such laws with the nearest possible approach to equal justice to all the inter- ests involved. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS. Having thus completed as full and careful a survey as possible of the whole field of inquiry, your commissioners present the following summary of the more important conclusions they have formed: The only form of railway control likely to prove successful under present conditions, is the legislative, supplemented by direct supervision; the legislature laying downt general rules of action, but 9½-R.

Nobody will doubt that he may enforce against public corporation, contracts and duties which they ought to perform towards him- himself; and, in doing this, sometimes the public interests are subserved, and this is all right. But it is his special interest that gives him the right to act. This might be enough for this case; but it may not be out of place to add that we have no doubt but the remedy by a bill for an injunction, sued out on the part of the commonwealth, by the Attorney General, would lie against a company to compel them to observe their charter obligations. It would, in this case, be a substitute for a mandamus, and come within the power given to courts of equity to control corporations other than municipal.&amp;quot; Buck Mountain C. Co. v. Lehigh Coal and N. Co., 50 Penn. St., 91. The same question came before the supreme court of Missouri, in 1873, upon an information in equity, against a municipal corporation. Shepley, C. J., in delivering the opinion of the court, reviews the cases at great length, and sustains the jurisdiction. This is his general conclusion: &amp;quot;It seems to me that, both on principle and authority, this proceeding is maintainable, and that, while in the case of private corporations, the courts of this country will sustain the conclusions arrived at in 2 Johns. Ch., 371, in 103 Mass., 138, and 104 Mass., 239, that the writ of quo warranto affords am- ple and efficient remedy for violation of its charter or misuse or abuse of its powers; and that, therefore, this form of proceeding will not lie; the powers of the state, through its proper legal officers, to restrain public corporations from a violation of the law will be sustained.&amp;quot; State v. Saline Co., 51 Mo., 350. There is a strong presumption that the term private corporations, as here used, is intended to designate private trading corporations; and the term, public corporations, to include all quasi public corporations, whose relations with the public involve public interests and public questions. This is indi- cated by the cases in Massachusetts on which the distinction is rested, and the language of the court in those cases; and seems to follow from many other cases cited and commented on, which certainly do not confine the rem- edy to private corporations, in the sense in which these defendants are such. And, indeed, it is not easy to see how a private trading corporation could cause public injury by a mere abuse or excess of franchise, or otherwise than as a natural person might. This construction of Judge Shepley&apos;s language is confirmed by the additional opinion of Judge Bliss, who discusses the ques- tion at some length, and recognizes no such qualification of the jurisdiction. He says: &amp;quot;How much more adequate the remedy that prevents the doing of any legal wrong, than those that are merely punitive, or that compel every tax payer to prosecute.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I am aware that the jurisdiction of a court of equity, by in- junction, even to restrict a public nuisance, hasbeen denied in Massachusetts under their statute, (Hale v. Cushman, 6 Metc., 425), but is established in Eng- land, and generally admitted in the United States; and the rule as to the proper plaintiff is, I believe, universal.&amp;quot; And this is further confirmed by the dissenting opinion of Wagner, J. He objects to the jurisdiction assumed, as injuriously affecting the rights of stockholders, which must mean those of quasi public corporations. And we feel safe in assuming that, so far as it is necessary here, this decision is in accord with the others cited on this point. In our investigations of this question, we have carefully examined all the authorities cited at the bar, and many others. It is probable that there may be others, which have escaped our attention. But we think that we have suf- ficiently shown that the jurisdiction has long been asserted and is very gen- erally recognized in the United States. And, before leaving this review of the authorities sustaining the jurisdiction, we wish to quote the terse and com- prehensive statement of its scope, given by the supreme court of Pennsylva- nia: &amp;quot;This remedy extends to all acts that are contrary to law, and prejudi- cial to the interests of the community and for which there is no adequate remedy at law.&amp;quot; Kerr v. Trego, 47 Penn. St., 292. Two cases in Massachusetts were cited for the defendants, as denying the jurisdiction. They do not seem to us to do so. &quot; &quot;Character and Present Condition of the Railroads. 39 tion in the several states named, have not yet assumed a form suffi- ciently definite to justify us in reporting to you special conclusions. We are impressed with the conviction, however, that the intelligent prosecution of this purpose is fraught with consequences of great practical importance, both to the public and to railway management. CHARACTER AND PRESENT Condition OF THE RAILROADS. The law under which the commissioners act does not impose up- on them the duty of making an inspection of the railroads of the state. Nevertheless an actual knowledge of the character and con- dition of the roads was deemed so manifestly important that the several members of the board availed themselves of such opportu- nities as could be had for examining them; and one of their number passed one or more times over each and all of the roads in Wiscon- sin, noting all such facts as were deemed most essential. It is natural, if not almost necessary, that railways built in a new state and through districts but sparsely settled should be both less perfectly constructed and less completely equipped than in the older states. The amount of business that can be done for many years, under such conditions does not warrant the building of very ex- pensive roads, or the supply of elegant station-houses and costly equipments. There is a minimum cost, however, below which it is never economy to go, under even the most unfavorable conditions as to traffic and travel. The safety of passengers and a reasonable security of the property carried, as well as of the rolling stock of the com- pany, are considerations that cannot be ignored on any account. And to guarantee these, requires the most careful and consci- entious attention to many matters-requires that the road-bed be broad, firm and substantial, the culverts and bridges well built of good material, the rail of good quality and properly laid. These are some of the essential characteristics. Without them no road should ever be opened for public use. There are still other characteristics, which, even more than those above named, determine the cost of transportation. These will be found discussed in another connection. Just here, however, it is proper to say that the roads of Wiscon- sin bear a fair comparison with the other roads of this country. They were much more cheaply graded than many of those located &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 171 WISCONSIN CENTRAL RAILROAD-Statement of Cost-from Reports of the Company. COST OF ROAD. YEAR.

No legislature con- Governments may de- ferred them, and none can take them away. fine these rigbts, and throw around them the safeguards of law; and this much they are bound to do. They are also bound to do it wisely and justly. The facts which demand the intervention of public authority are enforced and multiplied by all experience and investigation. Not merely in the theory of law, but as a practical fact, railways have become public highways, and all classes of our people are as de- pendent upon their wholesome management as upon the wholesome management of any other public property. The assumption on the part of the advocates of non-intervention, that the public has a choice between other methods of transportation and transportation by rail, is without actual truth. If the choice exists, that choice cannot be exercised, except upon such conditions as to render the privilege nugatory. As to large masses of freight, and a consider- able portion of passenger travel, rapid transit by rail is the only available alternative presented. And were the fact otherwise, it is impossible to presume, under any known axiom of good government, that interests so vast and manifold as to involve the fundamental conditions of public progress and prosperity should be surrendered to the undisputed determination of a personal discretion, based solely upon considerations of private or corporate profit. 4. That control is demanded in the interest of capital. Most assuredly, the relations of our people to capital are not to be ignored. We are not under any circumstances to overlook the grave fact that the material interests of our state are vitally depend- ent upon the safety and ample remuneration of future investment in railway construction. A consultation of the comparative sta- tistics of this report will show you that the industries of Wisconsin are far more dependent upon future investment than past expendi- ture in this direction; and we know of no consideration of material interest or public morals which can counsel indifference to the hon- orable claims of capital to ample consideration for all legitimate ex- penditure. Protection of capital from mismanagement.-It will not be assumed, however, that the interests of capital itself can be best promoted by the mismanagement of railways, or by the imposition of extortionate rates, or unjust discriminations.

The re- ceipts from the commencement were given as follows: subscriptions to stock, paid in, including stock issued to contractors for work done, $170,000; stock issued and to be issued by conversion of bonds for work done by contractors, $200,000; stock subscribed by individuals for depots, etc., $100,000; stock subscriptions of city of Janesville, $150,000; amount of bonds disposed of, $600,000, total receipts, $1,220,000. The resources for future operations were given as follows: expected subscriptions-from Fond du Lac, $100,000; Watertown, $50,000; Jefferson, $40,000; Koshkonong, $40,000; individual stock subscriptions, $350,000; bonds yet available, $600,000; total, $1,180,000. The work done was given as follows: lands, stations, machine shop, grad- ing, masonry, bridging, cross-ties, iron laid and on hand ready for laying, rolling stock between Fond du Lac and Janesville, engineering and incident- als, $1,004,648; ditto, between Janesville and state line, $199,912; expendi- tures on Madison branch, $45,000; total expenditures, $1,249,560. The esti- mated cost of completing and putting in operation the entire line from Fond du Lac to the state line, was $1,150,000: total cost of road, actual and esti- mated, fully equipped, $2,400,000-about $22,400 per mile, including all losses and contingent expenditures. Mr. B. H. Edgerton examined the road in the spring of 1854, and estimated the total apparent expenditures of the company on the whole line at $455,790 only. June 2, 1859, the property and franchises of the Chicago, St. Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad Company, were sold at public aution at Janesville, Wiscon- sin, by the trustee of its mortgage, bearing date Aug. 1, 1855, for the sum of $200,000; also, at the same time and place, by the trustees of its second mort- gage, bearing date April 6, 1857, for the sum of $40,000. [See Report of Illinois Commissioners for 1873-p. 229,] GREEN BAY, MILWAUKEE AND CHICAGO RAILROAD. The survey from Milwaukee to the Illinois State line was reported to the directors in July, 1852. Length of line from the present East Water street bridge, in Milwaukee, to the Illinois line, 38,791 miles. The estimated cost of the road, including T rail weighing not less than 60 lbs. per yard, right of way, grading, ballasting, bridging, superstructures, depots and grounds, equipments, engineering and office expenses, amounted to $551,519.20 or $14,217.71 per mile. On this basis, the cost of the road from Milwaukee to Chicago-85 miles-equipped with 9 locomotives, 18 passenger cars, 36 treight cars, 44 gravel cars, with necessary stations, depots and grounds, would be $1,208,505.35. The cost of the proposed extension of the line from Milwaukee to Green Bay was estimated at $15,000 per mile. BELOIT AND MADISON RAILROAD. At the close of the year ending December 31, 1853, the engineer made a re- port to the directors, in which he gave the length of the road at 47.65, and the cost, exclusive of equipment and interest during construction, at $875,000. &quot; &quot;68 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

DEAR SIR: In reply to your letter of October 15, I quote you rates from Merrillan to Marshall, Minnesota, as follows: Merrillan to Winona, $19 per car; Winona to Marshall, $38 per car of 20,000 pounds. We are not working under the Potter law, and, if we were, it would not apply to shipments going to Winona, or out of the state. Yours truly, * * * DAN. ATWOOD, Gen&apos;l Ft Agent. THE COMMISSION TO MR. PEDRICK. M. PEDRICK, Esq., Fairchild, Wis.: FAIRCHILD, October 21, 1874. DEAR SIR:-I am instructed by the Railroad Commissioners to reply, gen- erally, to yours of the 20th, that the &amp;quot;Potter Law&amp;quot; has no application to through freight, and that the point whether freights shipped to other states come under this act on so much of the route as is in Wisconsin, or is to be held as inter-state commerce has not yet been judicially decided. Until the question is settled by the highest tribunals, the board will refrain from passing upon it, confining their action to cases wholly within the limits of the state. It is reported that the Supreme Court of the United States will in December next, finally settle this vexed question, in a suit now pending. I am very truly Yours, H. A. TENNEY, Clerk of the Board. COMPLAINT―J. &amp;amp; A. C. STREETER vs. C. M. &amp;amp; ST. P. R. R. CO. Mr. GEO. H. PAUL: OCONOMOWOC, Wis., December 11, 1874. DEAR SIR:-We desire to ascertain of you whether there is any chance for us to get a drawback on freight. We have paid our freights under protest, and have paid in excess of the Potter law rates, from March 13, 1874, to May 1st, about $260, from May 1st to October 1st, about $600, and from October 1st to date, about $600-total nearly $1,500. We have not figured it accurately, but it will not vary much from these figures. A part of our company (Moore Galloway &amp;amp; Baker) manufacture lumber at Fond du Lac, and we receive most of our stock from them. The railway companies are now charging us the same rates that they have been since October 1, 1874, $21.00 per car from &quot; &quot;2 Report of Railroad Commissioners. GENERAL CLASSES.

CURRIER, Secretary. &quot; &quot;78 Appendix. and is properly subject to absolute legislative control. The distinction is a just one, and is very marked and manifest. It may be that the territorial laws would have survived the change, without this constitutional provision, as the laws of conquered countries are said to survive conquest. Even in that case, they would have been subject to repeal. But the territorial laws actually survived the change, by force of no such prin- ciple, but by the express provision of the constitution. That instrument ex- pressly continued them in force, until altered or repealed by the legislature, and no longer. The effect is to render subject to subsequent alteration or re- peal, all territorial laws which were then subject to alteration or repeal. This makes all such laws expressly subject to alteration or repeal, the iden- tical words of the reserved power in sec. 1, art. XI. And this use here of the very words used there, and the provision for laws expiring by their own lim- itation, raise a very strong presumption that sec. 2, art. XIV, has special rela tion to corporate charters. For there was probably no statute of the territory which would expire by its own limitation, except such charters. Indeed the whole provision for alteration or repeal is nugatory, except so far as it has relation to charter contracts within the Dartmouth College rule; for all other laws would be subject to repeal without any provision for it. The provision was probably intended to take the place of the reserved power in the terri- torial R. S. of 1839, which, being so replaced, was accordingly repealed in the first state revision in 1849. We therefore hold that the unaccepted territorial charter of the Milwaukee &amp;amp; Waukesha Railroad Company, till then subject to alteration or repeal by the territorial legislature, was continued in force by Sec. 2, Art. XIV. of the constitution, subject to alteration or repeal by the state legislature, just as a charter by the state; and all the positions of our former opinion in regard to state charters apply equally to the territorial charters of 1847, 1848. The present motion of the Attorney General must therefore be granted. ORDER OF THE COURT. STATE OF WISCONSIN VS. CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL RAILWAY COMPANY. This motion of the Attorney General in this case, to vacate so much of the order in this cause, made on the 15th day of September, inst., as excepts from the writ of injunction thereby ordered to issue, the railroad from Milwaukee to Prairie du Chien, under and in pursuance of two acts of the legislature of the territory of Wisconsin, approved, respectively, on the 11th day of Febru ary, 1847, and the 11th day of March, 1848, as in the said order were particu- larly stated, having been heretofore fully argued by the counsel of both par- ties, and submitted, and having been duly considered by the court, and it ap- pearing that the said writ of injunction has not yet been issued, it is now or- dered by the court, that so much of the said order of this court, made on the 15th day of September, inst., as exempts from the said writ of injunction, the said railroad from Milwaukee to Prairie du Chien be, and the same is hereby vacated, and that the said writ of injunction, when issued, shall include all the railroads in this state, owned, operated, managed or leased by the de- fendant. &quot; &quot;60 Appendix. And we have given some brief history of the rule, and of its application and its mischief, not for any purpose of combating it, but for the purpose of showing the significance and scope of the reserved power over corporate charters in our state constitution. For the very purpose of that reservation of power was to exclude the rule from all application to corporate charters in this state, and to restore the state all its otherwise inherent authority over its own corporations. This court has several times had occasion to discuss this reserved power, as one well understood and of undoubted efficiency. Madison, W. &amp;amp; W. Plank Road Co. v.

Crusen, 31 Wis., 209; West Wisconsin R. R. Co. v. Trempealeau, MS. January T., 1874. As long ago as 1854, six years after the adoption of the constitution, Mr. Justice Smith observed in Pratt v. Brown, supra: &amp;quot;In all instances, however, in which this power to take private propeety for public use has deen delegat- ed to corporations, the parties interested in such grant have been compelled to rely for the perpetuity of the grant, either upon the pledged faith of the sovereign power making the grant, or upon constitutional compacts inhibit- ing the power of revocation. The doctrine that a charter of incorporation, conferring certain franchises upon a company or individual, was in the nature of a grant, and hence protected from enroachment or attack by the Federal constitution, was established after elaborate argument and on full consideration by the supreme court of the United States, in the Dartmouth College case. This doctrine has, since that decision, been acquiesced in by nearly if not quite all the state courts of the Union. It is competent, never- theless, for each state by constitutional regulation or specific legislative enact- ment, to reserve the power to modify or repeal all such acts of incorporation. When the power of modification or repeal is reserved, either in the one mode or the other, it is obvious that the grantees must rely for the perpetuity and integrity of the franchises granted to them solely on the faith of the sov- ereign grantor. Hence, since the decision of the Dartmouth College case, some of the states, and our own among the number, have, by constitutional provision, reserved to their legislature the right of modification or repeal of all special acts of incorporation, and all such corporations now rest upon the faith of the state, taking care to deserve its favor by observing strictly the limits, of their powers, and accomplishing by all legitimate means the objects of their incorporation.&amp;quot; In 1863, in Kenosha R. &amp;amp; R. I. R. R. Co. v. Marsh, supra, Mr. Justice Paine said: &amp;quot;The occasion of reserving such a power in the constitution or in the charters themselves, is well understood. It grew out of the decisions of the Supreme court of the United States, that charters were contracts within the meaning of the constitutional provision that the States should pass no law impairing the obligation of contracts. This was supposed to deprive the States of that power of control over corporations which was deemed essential to the safety and protection of the public. Hence the practice which has extensively prevailed since those decisions, of reserving the power of amend- ing or repealing charters. It was solely to avoid the effect of the decision that the charter itself was a contract between the state and the corporation, so as to enable the state to impose such salutary restraint upon those bodies as experience might prove to be necessary. Undoubtedly the legislature might, under this power, impose new duties and new restraints upon corpor- ations in the prosecution of the enterprises already undertaken. And provi- sions of this nature would be binding whether assented to or not.&amp;quot; In 1870, in Whiting v. Sheboygan and F. du L. R. R. Co., supra, Chief Justice Dixon enters into an able and elaborate consideration of the subject, from which we quote: &amp;quot;And here it occurs to us to observe that, under the prin- cipies announced in the Dartmouth College case and in the numerous cases which have followed it in the same court, and by the authority of which the courts of all the states are bound, this power of the state to regulate and con- trol the franchise and fix the amount of the tolls, has been frequently wholly lost. &amp;quot;Be this matter as it may in other states, the question can never arise &quot; &apos;Official Papers and Correspondence. 21 PRESIDENT ALEX. MITCHELL TO THE COMMISSIONERS. CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL RAILWAY. MILWAUKEE, September 3, 1874. GENTLEMEN:- While we do not recognize the right or power of the legis lature to fix the compensation of railway companies, for the transportation of freight and passengers, as attempted by chapter 273 of the laws of 1874, we do not dispute the right to appoint commissioners and devolve upon them the duties usually appertaining to that office. You have heretofore been informally notified of our readiness to exhibit our books and the records and papers of this office to your inspection, and to fur- nish you any information you may require relative to the management, con- dition, income, and expenditures of the company. That there may be no misapprehension on the subject, I would say, that we will, whenever requested, exhibit to you at our office, any and all books, på- pers and records of the company relating to its management, present condi tion, income and expenditures, and will furnish you every thing necessary to enable you to make a complete and thorough examination in relation thereto, and the manner of transacting our business; and on request will furnish you any information you may reasonably ask, and in our power to give. His Excellency, Governor Taylor, in a recent public address, is reported to have stated on the authority of the Railroad Commissioners, that the &quot;Potter law&quot; entailed on the roads mentioned in class &quot;A,&quot; a loss from the tariffs in force at the time of its passage of only about five per cent. of their gross earnings. I am aware that the Commissioners would not intentionally mis- represent the position of the railway companies, but it will certainly be un- fortunate for all concerned if statements so inconsistent with the facts are given out, when the Commissioners have ready access to correct information, and the power to absolutely verify its truth. We are especially desirous that any report you may make, should state the facts correctly in regard to this company, its officers and management, and with that view tender to you every facility to make a complete and full examination of the books, papers and records of the company. Yours very respectfully. ALEX. MITCHELL. To Messss. GEO. H. PAUL, JOHN W. HOYT, JOSEPH H. OSBORN, Railroad Commissioners of the State of Wisconsin. COMMISSIONER HOYT TO PRESIDENT MITCHELL.

WISCONSIN CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY-PRESENT CASH VALUATION. MILWAUKEE, Wis., Dec. 15, 1874. To the Board of Railroad Commissioners, Madison: GENTLEMEN: Enclosed please find report as requested. I regret the delay, but its preparation required more time than I supposed. To estimate &amp;quot;actual present value&amp;quot; of the property of the Wisconsin Cen- tral Railroad Company, is impossible, if it means market value. Ties in the ground, masonry in culverts, etc., have no market value. Supposing the com- missioners to desire our estimate of the present worth of this property to us, as representing the cash cost paid up to present time for the incomplete road and equipment which is all in the possession of the Phillips &amp;amp; Colby Con- struction Company, the company has classified the items by estimating, as far as was possible. How much more or less than this estimate the property is worth to the company, depends greatly upon the settlement yet to be made in a wilderness, and the possibility of raising money to finish the railroad, and the course of legislation about railroads in Wisconsin. The construction accounts being yet open, and the enterprise incomplete, it is not possible to make any definite return to these inquiries. Yours, very respectfully, CHAS L. COLBY, Vice President.

That said act was duly published on the 28th day of April, 1874, and took effect or said last mentioned day. That in and by the provisions of said act, among other things, all the rail- roads of the state were divided into classes; all freights thereafter to be transported upon said railroads or any part thereof were classified and the compensation to be charged and received by the railroad companies owning, managing and operating said railroads for the transportation of freights and passengers over their respective roads fixed and limited as therein prescribed, and that the said defendant is mentioned and described in said chapter 273, as the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company. That there is no corpora- tion in the state by the name of the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Com- pany, and has not been since the change in the name of said corporation as aforesaid, and whenever the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company is mentioned in said chapter 273, the defendant is meant and intended to be re- ferred to and described. And the plaintiff further shows upon information and belief, that the said defendant, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company on the 29th day of April, 1874, filed in the office of governor of the state of Wisconsin, a communication in writing, signed by Alexander Mitchell, its president, in which, among other things, it announced its purpose to disregard the provis ions of said chapter 273, so far as the same attempts to fix the rates of com- pensation for freights and passengers, and to manage and operate its railroad within the state of Wisconsin without regard to its requirements. And the plaintiff further shows that the defendant, on or about the 6th day of May, 1874, adopted and issued a tariff of rates for freights to be transport- ed between local stations within the state, to take effect on the 8th day of May, 1874, and has also adopted a tariff of rates for freights and passengers trans- ported over their railroads within the state of Wisconsin, and a classification of freights, all of which are in disregard of the rates and classification fixed by said chapter 273, and contrary to the requirements of said chapter. That the said defendant has also issued to its agents and servants instruc- tions to charge, demand and receive of all persons passing over its railroad or shipping freight thereon, the rates and compensations set forth and adopted in the several tariffs and schedules so issued by said defendant as aforesaid. And the plaintiff further shows that the classification, rates and compensa- tions so adopted by the said defendant are higher and greater than those fixed and authorized by said chapter 273. And the plaintiff further shows, upon information and belief, and so al- leges the fact to be, that the said defendant has, ever since the 29th day of April, 1874, used and operated its railroad within the state of Wisconsin, in entire disregard of the provisions of said chapter 273, and is, and has been daily and habitually charging and receiving greater and higher rates and compensation for the transportation of freights and passengers upon its said railroad, within this state, than are fixed and established or allowed by said chapter 273, and that said rates and compensation are so charged and received by said defendant as aforesaid, for carrying freight which does not come from beyond the boundaries of the state to be carried across or through the same. And the plaintiff further shows, upon information and belief, that on the 12th day of May, 1874, the defendant charged and received of one David Stephenson of the city of Madison, the sum of eighteen dollars for carrying and transporting five thousand brick from the city of Watertown to the city of Madison in said state of Wisconsin, the same being one car load, and was transported by said defendant over its railroad since the said 6th day of May, 1874, in car No. 1497; that the distance between said city of Watertown and the said city of Madison, on and by the said defendant&apos;s railroad, does not exceed thirty-eight miles, and the sum so demanded and received by said de- fendant for carrying and transporting said car load of brick as aforesaid, was two dollars in excess of the sum charged and received by the said defendant for the same service during the year 1873, and was a higher and greater rate than that fixed and allowed by said chapter 273. &quot; &quot;Remedial Measures. 115 or produce of any sort, must make an extra charge to cover the contingency of a rise in the rates of transportation before he can get his purchase into the hands of the consignee; and so the pro- ducers are constantly receiving less than its real value for what they sell, and the consumer is paying more. Nor is it any better for the middle-man, unless he be so fortunate as to have special re- lations with the transportation companies who handle his shipments.. TIMELY NOTICE OF PROPOSED CHANGES OF RATES. To obviate the embarrassments just referred to, and incidentally to prevent one very common means of dscriminating in favor of particular traders and localities, every railway company should be required to give timely notice of proposed changes as a condition of the legality and collectibility of the new rates. And the notifi- cation should be made in such form and manner, moreovere as would give to all persons using the stations and lines an equal opportunity to know of the change. In most other countries such an obligation has long been im- posed; the length of notice varying from one month to six months. UNIFORMITY IN CLASSIFCATION OF FREIGHTS. Allusion has already been made to this subject in the earlier por- tion of this report, and to the purpose of the railroad commission- ers of this and the neighboring states to encourage the adoption of a system of classification more uniform for at least the northwest- ern states. Uniformity in the classification of articles of freight is hardly more important to the shipper than it is to the railway company. For where each company has its own classification, it is less conve- nient determining what the charge should be over two or more lines. Uniformity throughout the state is very desirable, and we can see no sufficient reason why greater uniformity throughout the whole country would not be a matter of great convenience. The remarks already made touching the determination of passen- ger rates apply equally in general terms to freight rates. For many of the classifications of articles of freight appear to have been in good degree an arbitrary creation-to have been formed without regard to either usual quantity, risk of carrying, convenience of handling, or other discoverable consideration. In many cases, moreover, the classifications are too rigid for the &quot; &quot;170 Appendix. PORTAGE, STEVENS POINT AND SUPERIOR RAILROAD COM. PANY, AND PORTAGE, WINNEBAGO AND SUPERIOR RAIL- ROAD COMPANY. CONSOLIDATION. These articles of consolidation made and entered into this 23d day of No- vember, A D. 1870, by and between the Portage, Stevens Point and Superior Railroad Company, party of the first part, and the Portage, Winnebago and Superior Railroad Company, party of the second part, witnesseth: That the said party of the first part, a corporation duly incorporated and organized by and under the laws of the state of Wisconsin, and as author- ized by its acts of incorporation by its President, W. W. Corning, duly au- thorized, and subject only to the approval of a majority of its board of di- rectors, for and in consideration of the covenants and agreements herein con- tained to be kept and performed by and on the part of the party of the sec- ond part, has covenanted and agreed and does hereby covenant and agree to assign, transfer to and consolidate with, and does hereby assign and transfer all its rights, powers, privileges, stock and franchises to and thereby become consolidated with the said party of the second part and covenants and agrees that the said party of the second part by and under its name aforesaid, or by whatever name it may hereafter become known, and its successors and assigns shall have the right to take and may take, have, hold, exercise and enjoy all and singular the said rights, powers, privileges, stock and franchises as abso- lutely and completely as though directly granted to and conferred upon it by law, upon the conditions and of the covenants and agreements herein on its part to be kept and performed. The said party of the second part, as authorized by law by its President, Geo. Reed, thereto duly authorized, for and in consideration of the said cov- enants and agreements and of the said assignment and transfer to it of the said rights, powers, privileges, stock and franchises, hereby covenants and agrees that said rights, powers, privileges, stock and franchises are taken and are to be held, exercised and enjoyed by it and its successors and assigns for the purpose of carrying into effect the covenants and agreements herein on its part contained, and upon the terms, conditions and limitations following to-wit: First. That immediately after the ratification of these articles by a major- ity of the board of directors of the said party of the first part, the said party of the second part shall at its own cost and charge cause to be commenced under the direction of competent engineers, a survey of the line of railroad on the most direct feasible route between Portage City and Stevens Point and have the same diligently prosecuted to completion, and complete and proper estimates of the cost of the construction of the track thereon, made by the said engineers within ninety days from the time of the ratification aforesaid. Second. That said party of the second part shall as soon as practicable after the location of the said line of railroad has been made, submit to such municipal corporations on the route of said road, as authorized by law and as it may deem advisable, propositions for aid towards the construction of said road and the procuring of the right of way and depot grounds therefor; and as soon as such right of way and depot grounds have been secured and a reasonable amount of said aid has been assured to said party of the second part, the work of construction of the track of said road shall be commenced, and the same fully completed ready for the laying of the ties and iron rails thereon within one year from the first day of June next: and that the iron shall be laid thereon and cars run over the same within two years from the said ratification hereof. Third. That on the failure by the said party of the second part to perform any one of the said covenants, on its part, herein contained, the said party of the first part shall have the right, on twenty days&apos; notice, and on payment to the said party of the second part, its successors or assigns, all such sums of money as shall have been reasonably expended by it or them, the said suc- cessors or assigns, in or about the construction of said track of railroad, to &quot; &quot;50 Appendix. the last case which we have seen in the Court of Appeals sustains the public remedy in equity. People v. Vanderbilt, 26 N. Y., 287. The jurisdiction, as applied to abuse or excess of corporate franchise, is de- nied in the last case we have seen in that court on the precise question. People v. Albany and Vt. R. R. Co., 24 N. Y., 261. We have been referred to several cases, in other courts of that state, for and against the jurisdiction. For it are Davis v. Mayor, etc., 2 Duer, 663; People v. Mayor, etc., 32 Barb., 102; People v. Albany and Vt. R. R. Co., 37 Barb., 216, reversed in 24 N. Y., 261. Against it are dicta of Vice Chancellor McCoun in Verplanck v. Mercantile Ins. Co., 1 Edwards, 88, and of Strong, J., in Smith v. Lockwood, 13 Barb., 219; People v. Miner, 2 Lansing, 407, and People v. Albany and Ver. R. R. Co., supra. We must accept this last case as authoritative on the precise point, for the present, in New York; though in view of all the authorities, it is difficult, at this day, to reconcile it in principle with the latter case of People v. Vander- bilt. The latter case goes on the ground of pourpresture, which is a special kind of public nuisance. The common law defines a nuisance as anything unlawful, which works hurt, inconvenience or damage; and a pourpresture, formerly an intrusion on the King&apos;s soil, is now defined as an encroachment upon public rights or property. It is easy to understand how the courts have, of late, applied both terms to unlawful excess or abuse of corporate franchise, as an encroachment upon and a hurt to public rights. But it is difficult to appreciate how the courts of New York continue to adhere to the physical meaning of pourpresture, in the light of all the modern authorities, and to relieve the public and individuals against material nuisance, and refuse to relieve the state against the most serious form of pourpresture, only because it is immaterial. And we must be permitted to remark that the opinion of the court in 24 New York, is destitute of authority cited to uphold it; rests on the unsup- ported dictum of the court; and, however respectable in itself, and for the au- thority of the court which utters it, does not compare favorably with the able and learned opinions of Duer, J., in Davis v. Mayor, etc., and of Hogeboom, J., in People v. Mayor, etc. In face of all the authorities, and apparently ignor- ing them, it disposes of the question of jurisdiction in this brief and bare sentence: &amp;quot;Any remedy which the public may have for a breach or neglect of duty imposed by the railroad act, must be by mandamus, quo warranto or indictment; and the performance of such duty cannot be specifically enforced in equity at the suit of the attorney general.&amp;quot; Outside of New York, this opinion can weigh little against the current of authority. We are led to believe that the singular and erratic course of the New York courts on this subject is somewhat attributable to the case of Attorney General v. Utica Ins. Co., 2 Johns. Ch., 371, in 1817, followed in 1825 by Attorney Gener- al v. Bank of Niagara, Hopkins, 354. Whatever degree of deference might be due, in this day, to the decision of so illustrious an equity Judge as Chancellor Kent, made at so early a day, we are unable to regard Attorney General v. Utica Ins. Co. as authority against the jurisdiction under consideration. It was an information in equity by the Attorney General for an injunction against the corporation to restrain it from usurping banking powers. The court held that no injury to the public or private persons was averred or apparent; which, in that day, if not now, would be adequate ground for dismissing the information. But the court goes on to discuss the equitable jurisdiction of nuisance and kindred cases, and incidentally denies the authority of equity to enjoin excess of coporate franchise; though the Chancellor leaves room for an inference that he might have held other ise, had a public evil been averred or apparent. It must be borne in mind that this was long before the era of great corporations in this country, and that the modern practice of courts of equity in England and this country, of applying the equitable remedy against nuisance to abuse of cor- porate franchise was nearly or quite unknown. And the Chancellor, passing from the single point of his decision, brings all his great learning to bear on all collateral questions, in such variety and at such length, that it is not alto- gether easy to discover what his precise views were on many subjects dis- cussed. We adopt the view of Chancellor Vroom, supra, that Chancellor Kent only &amp;quot;appears rather to question the jurisdiction.&amp;quot; Be that as it may, &quot; &apos;Records of Railway Companies. 97 at the city of Milwaukee by the marshal of the United States for said district, and James C. Carter, one of the undersigned, became the purchaser thereof at such sale, and such sale having afterwards been duly confirmed by the court aforesaid, the marshal did, on the 12th day of November, in the year last aforesaid, in pursuance of the power and authority in him vested by the decree aforesaid, execute and deliver under his hand and seal unto said James C. Carter, a certain deed dated the day last aforesaid, whereby he con- veyed unto the said James C. Carter, all the said railroad and all the property mortgaged as aforesaid as herein before described; and, WHEREAS, The said James C.

Holmes, Asahel Finch, Luther Beecher, Henry Koop and George W. Cobb, to each severally, one undivided five thousandth part of the property so conveyed to him by said marshal, and described in the said deed received by him from the marshal as aforesaid. Now, therefore, the said James C. Carter, the said purchaser, and the said Samuel I. Holmes, Asahel Finch, Luther Bucher, George W. Cobb and Henry Koop, his associates and assigns, for the purpose of organizing the said Min- eral Point Railrc ad Company anew, under and in pursuance of the provis- ions of section 33 (thirty-three), of chapter 79 (seventy-nine), of the Revised Statutes of Wisconsin, for such cases made and provided, and of the charter of said company, do hereby associate themselves together under the name of &quot;The Mineral Point Railroad,&quot; and do agree to and adopt the following arti- cles of association: Article First. The name of the re-organization hereby made shall be &quot;The Mineral Point Railroad,&quot; and its principal office be in the town of Mineral Point, Wisconsin, until elsewhere fixed by the board of directors. Article Second. The affairs of the corporation shall be managed by a board consisting of five directors, who shall be chosen annually by ballot, at the time hereinafter prescribed by the stockholders. The directors so chosen shall hold their offices for one year, or until other directors are chosen to suc- ceed them; but, until the first Monday of July next following the execution of these articles, Luther Beecher, Asahel Finch, Samuel I. Holmes, George W. Cobb and James C. Carter shall serve as directors. None but stockhold- ers shall be elected directors, and at every election where stockholders are called upon to vote, each share of stock shall be entitled to one vote; and, in cases of the election of directors, the five candidates having the greatest number of votes shall be declared duly elected. Article Third. The said directors shall appoint one of their own number to be president, and may also appoint a secretary, treasurer, superintendent, and such other officers and servants as they may find to be necessary. They shall meet at such times and places, and be convened in such manner as they may hereafter decide upon; but there shall be, at the city of Milwaukee, a meeting of the board for the purpose of the election of president and secre- tary, and the transaction of other necessary business, immediately upon the execution of these articles. Article Fourth. The capital stock of said corporation shall be five hundred thousand dollars in shares of one hundred dollars each, and upon the con- veyance to the said corporation, by the persons hereinafter named, of the property formerly belonging to the Mineral Point Railroad Company, and purchased by the said James C. Carter at the foreclosure sale herein before mentioned, which conveyance is to take place as soon as may be after the execution of these articles. The directors shall issue a certificate to the said James C. Carter for four thousand nine hundred and ninety-five shares of stock, and a certificate to each of the other persons herein before named for one share of stock; such certificate to be in the form heretofore used by the Mineral Point Railroad Company, and signed by the president and counter- signed by the secretary, and sealed with the corporate seal. Article Fifth. There shall be an annual meeting of the stockholders for the purpose of electing directors, on the first Monday of July in each year, at the office of the company in Mineral Point, or at such other place as shall be appointed by a resolution of the board of directors, of which meeting at least thirty days notice shall be given by publishing the same weekly in a &apos; &quot;&quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 237 mah, so far as the same are required for the satisfaction of the completed portion, may be sold for the benefit of the Wisconsin Railroad Farm Mort- gage Company, and those between Tomah and Black River Falls, for the benefit of the West Wisconsin Railroad Company. &amp;quot;The lands certified to the state under the act of 1856, are of sections &apos;in place,&apos; that is within the six mile limits. &amp;quot;The lands within the indemnity limits have not as yet been selected, therefore the state or its agents is entitled to select for the benefit of the Farm Mortgage Company indemnity lands within the fifteen mile or indem- nity limit of that part of the road completed between Portage City and Tomah. &amp;quot;The land grant of the La Crosse and Milwaukee road, north and west of Tomah, is now superceded by the Tomah and St. Croix Railroad grant, and all lands other than those heretofore certified under act of 1856, must be se- lected and patented under the act of May 5, 1864. &amp;quot;For the finished portion of that road they are entitled now to select the lands due for such completed part, and upon such selections being reported in accordance with the instructions contained in the enclosed circular, they will receive the prompt action of this office. &amp;quot;I am, sir, very respectfully, JOS. S. WILSON, Commissioner.&amp;quot; The report of the Farm Mortgage Commissioners, dated Feb. 2, 1874, states that since the organization of the Wisconsin Railroad Farm Mortgage Land Company, it had received in trust the title to 68,820 acres of land. Claims had been filed with the Commissioners by mortgagors to the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, and to the Milwaukee and Hori- con Railroad Company, amounting in the aggregate to $951,356.25. 44,350 acres of land had been sold, leaving nearly 24,000 acres on hand. The total receipts were $45,627.97. The Commissioners state that unless the company obtain more land, it was not probable that the dividends would ever reach 10 per cent. of the claims allowed. 1. It will be seen that the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, up to June, 1862, claimed to be entitled to the amount of lands due for the com- pletion of 60 miles of road, amounting, at the rate of six sections per mile, and 240 sections for the first 20 miles, and 120 sections for each succeeding 20 miles, to 307,000 acres of land, and at any rate to have received the certifi- cate of Gov. Bashford for the completion of 40 miles, which entitled them to 360 sections, or 230,400 acres of land. 2. That on 25th April, 1863, the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad was sold by the U. S. Marshal to W. H. White and W. W. Pratt, and that on the 5th May, 1863, those parties conveyed the same, with all the lands to which the said road might be entitled, to the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Com- pany. 3. That in June, 1863, and also in August, 1863, the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company applied to Gov. Salomon for his certificate, which was re- fused. 4. That, Dec. 16, 1863, a certified list of vacant and unappropriated lands within the six mile limits, and on the route of the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad, amounting to 324,704 acres of land, was received and recorded in the office of the Secretary of State. &quot; &quot;8 Appendix. ADDRESS BY THE GOVERNOR. STATE OF WISCONSIN, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, MADISON, May 21, 1874. To the People of Wisconsin: The act of your legislature, passed at the last session, entitled &amp;quot; an act rela- ting to railroads, express and telegraph companies in the state of Wisconsin,&apos; was approved by me March 11, 1874, in the firm conviction of the necessity and validity of such legislation. But, in order that ample time should be given to the railroad companies affected thereby to arrange their business so as to meet its requirements, the legislature very considerately directed that its publication, which was essential to its tak ing effect, should be delayed un- til the 28th day of April. 1 So far from using this period of forty-eight days for such purpose, however, two of the most powerful railroad companies, as you are aware, to wit: the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul, and the Chicago and Northwestern Rail- way Companies, appear to have employed it in conspiring against the law, and in laying plans to defeat its operation. To this end, they procured, and widely published, the opinions of counsel hitherto in high repute, denying, first, the right of the state to limit the tariffs of railway corporations; and sec- ondly, upon the basis of ex parte testimony, pronouncing this particular law invalid, on account of the rates therein prescribed being unjust and unreason- able, and gravely encouraging disobedience to its commands. Acting upon these opinions of interested counsel, and under the dictation of directors re- siding in remote parts of the country, the presidents of these companies then addressed communications to your Executive, declaring their belief in the in- justice and invalidity of the law, and their deliberate purpose to disregard its provisions. It is known to you that immediately thereafter, to wit, on the first day of May, I made a public proclamation of these facts, declaring that the law of the land must be obeyed; that while the right of all to test the validity of the law is conceded, with that right is coupled the duty of yielding obedience to its requirements until it has been pronounced invalid by competent author- ity; expressing the hope that better counsels would yet prevail with the rail- road companies of the state; and enjoining all railroad corporations, their officers and agents, peaceably to submit to the law. This counsel and pro- clamation of your Executive have been wholly disregarded. The corporations above named have arranged their tariffs without the slightest apparent regard to the classification and rates prescribed in the law, and prepared and published by the Board of Railroad Commissioners. In many cases they have even increased their rates for transportation of freight above what they were when the law was enacted and became of binding obli- gation. They have issued commands to their agents and employés, requiring of them a like obedience, under pains and penalties which, in many cases, practically amount to compulsion; thus using their influence and power to insure the criminal disobedience of many citizens, habituating them to a con- tempt for the authority of the state, when its laws are not in harmony with a supposed self-interest, and hence contributing in a high degree to weaken the respect for law in general. They are now exacting and receiving rates which the legislature, after much consideration, and the patient hearing of able counsel and officers representing their interests, has, in effect, solemnly de- clared unreasonable, unjust and extortionate, and they boldly proclaim to the authorities and people of the state, and to the world, that they will continue so to do, any law of the state, not approved by them, to the contrary notwith- standing. In a word, they have set up another law than that of the state, and have made obedience to it the supreme duty of all their corporate ser- vants and the present necessity of the whole people. No objection is made to any just contest upon the validity of the law. The courts of this state are open to every suitor, and the cause of every defend ant will be heard with impartiality and decided upon principles of justice &quot; &quot;4 Appendix. be paid the interest on our bonds and the dividends to our stockholders. It is therefore manifest that this law will take from us over three-fourths of the net income received under our present tariff, and yet the total net income of last year was not sufficient to pay six per cent. on the actual cost of the property. Comment is unnecessary upon a law which proposes thus to de- prive capital, permanently invested under the sacred promise and pledge of a great state, of a suitable and reasonable return. Can it be that such a law, and passed under such circumstances, is consti- tutional and binding? Can the sacred obligation of the state to us be thus impaired? And can our property, invested on the faith and credit of the state, pledged in our charter, be thus confiscated? I do not believe it, and shall not, until compelled to do so by the decision of the highest court au- thorized to pass upon it. The board of directors have caused this act to be carefully examined and considered by our own counsel, and by some of the most eminent jurists in the land, and after such examination they are unanimous in their opinion that it is unconstitutional and void. The board of directors are trustees of this property, and are bound faithfully to discharge their trust, and to the best of their ability protect it from spoliation and ruin. They have sought the advice of able counsel and after mature consideration, believe it their duty to disregard so much of said law as attempts arbitrarily to fix rates of compensation for freight and passengers. I regret the necessity that compels the company to take this course, but it is the only one left to preserve the property, and properly test the question 1aised by the act. An unconstitutional act is void-a law that contravenes the constitution is of no effect. It is no law. The decision of the court only ascertains and declares that it is void. It is none the less unconstitutional and void, before it is so declared, than it is afterwards. Hence, such a law has no more binding force before than after the decision of the court. It is no jus- tification for any act done or omitted at any time. The only difference is that parties obeying or disregarding it, before the courts decide upon it, are, in either case, acting upon their peril. Should we obey this law, and by so do- ing allow the property committed to our trust to suffer waste, the law would be no legal justification of our conduct should it afterward be adjudged un- constitutional, and so if we disobey it, our act will be justified or not, accord- ing as the court may finally determine. Being placed therefore in a position where we are compelled to act, we have determined to act in accordance with the advice of our counsel, as we are fully satisfied that it is only by so doing that we can protect and guard the important interests committed to our charge. It is from no disrespect to your Excellency or the constituted au- thorities of the state, that the board of directors have determined on this course. They are fully aware that they are not able to contend with the state, or defy its laws, and were it not for the fact that they are fully convinced of the unconstitutionality of this act, would not adopt a course of action which would seem, even, to contravene a law of the state. But being fully conscious that the enforcement of the law will ruin the property of this company, and feeling assured of the correctness of the opinions of the eminent counsel who have examined the question, the directors feel compelled to disregard the pro- visions of the law, so far as it fixes a tariff of rates for the company, until the courts shall have finally passed upon the question of its validity. Respectfully yours, etc., ALEX. MITCHELL, President. &quot; &quot;TABLE OF CONTENTS. I. Page. ix . 17-139 1 18-46 INDICES TO THE THREE DIVISIONS REPORT PROPER INTRODUCTION .....

OPINION OF THE SUPREME COURT On the foregoing motion of the Attorney General, to include the Milwaukee and Prairie du Chien Division of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway, in the injunction granted by the Supreme Court, September 15, 1874. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL VS. THE CHICAGO, Milwaukee AND ST. PAUL RAILWAY COMPANY. In passing upon the principal motion of the Attorney General for an injunc- tion against the defendant, we excepted from the writ then allowed, the rail- road of the defendant from Milwaukee to Prairie du Chien, built under the territorial charter of 1847, 1848. There was then no evidence before us of the time when the Milwaukee and Waukesha Railroad Company was organized under that charter. But we held that, in the circumstances and especially because there seemed to be a recognition of the corporation as organized, in the territorial act of 1848, there was a presumption that the charter was accepted and the corporation organized before the adoption of the state con- stitution. But there was sufficient doubt of the actual fact, to induce us to give leave to the Attorney General to renew his motion so as to include that road in the injunction, if he should be so advised. He has accordingly made this motion, and in support of it he produces a certified copy of the statement of subscription and payment of capital stock, required by section 2 of the charter of February 11, 1847, dated April 5, 1849, and filed as the section required, with the treasurer of Milwaukee county, in the same month, and also an affidavit of the election of the first board of directors, May 10, 1849. This is conclusive of the fact that the charter was accepted and the corpo- ration organized many months after the adoption of the constitution and the admission of the state into the Union by congress. It would have saved great trouble had the attorney general presented the fact on the first motion. It is true that the defendant has filed an affidavit showing that, as early as November, 1847, and from thence till the organization of the corporation in 1849, action was taken by the commissioners appointed by the charter to re- ceive subscriptions to the capital stock of the proposed corporation, who elected a president and secretary, and opened the books of subscription to the stock, and caused application to be made to the territorial legislature for the supplementary act of March 11, 1848, all tending towards the organization of 1849. The affidavit states that by April 5, 1849, the necessary subscriptions and payments were made, but does not state that any subscription was made before the establishment of the state government. We do not think that these statements touch the conclusion to which we have come. The proceedings led up to the acceptance of the charter, but could not, by the terms of the charter, operate as an acceptance of it. Even if it had appeared that there were subscriptions to the stock before the terri- tory had become a state, such subscriptions, short of $100,000, required by the charter, could give no right to the subscribers to accept the charter. The terms of the charter expressly exclude such a right. The charter prescribes the conditions of acceptance. It gives no such right to the commissioners. They were only officers of the territory to fulfil a given function. And it gives no such right to the subscribers, until they should have subscribed the entire capital stock and made certain payments towards it. Then and then only, the charter confers on them the right of acceptance, in the manner which it provides; that is, by filing the very certificate of April 5, 1849. On and by the doing of that, the charter declares that the subscribers should be created a corporation. And thereupon an election of directors should be had, until which the commissioners should act as directors. There may be some doubt when the corporation actually came in esse, whether on the filing of the statement or on the election. Putnam v. Sweet, 1 Chandler, 286. That question is not material here. It is very certain that, by the terms of the &quot; &quot;Determination of Cost. 21 tion was necessarily prosecuted under the immediate direction of the company interested, and that the estimates of value refer more especially to the years 1872-3, when the prices of labor and mate- rials, and particularly the price of iron, ranged higher than during the past year. Possibly the returns made by this company are the only ones received by the commissioners which give the results of actual estimates by engineers. Several of the others are state- ments of aggregates, merely, unaccompanied by schedules, and hence afford no interested party an opportunity for verification, without himself making a full inventory of the property. Moreover some of the returns include considerable amounts paid out as interest on indebtedness, as well as the sums sacrificed in the form of discount. An examination of the valuations returned will show that the total cash valuation of all the roads reported is $68,680,444; in other words, that the valuation of 1,968.74 miles of road aggregates that amount; the average per mile being $34,885.78 and the mileage and cost of each road as follows: Present Cash Valuation and reported Cost of Railroads in_Wisconsin, as returned to the Railroad Commissioners, within the month of January, 1875.

PAUL RAILWAY, GENERAL MANAGER&apos;S OFFICE, MILWAUKEE, Sept. 28, 1874. His Excellency, W. R. TAYLOR, Governor, etc.: SIR: On the 28th of April last, I, as President of this company, sent you a communication on the subject of the so-called &amp;quot;Potter Law,&amp;quot; and advising you of the course which the company had determined to pursue in relation to it, and the reasons therefor. In that communicatton, I stated that &amp;quot;the Board of Directors have caused this act to be carefully examined and considered by our own counsel, and by some of the most eminent jurists in the land, and after such examination, they are unanimous in their opinion that it is unconstitutional and void. The Board of Directors are trustees of this property and are bound faithfully to discharge their trust, and to the best of their ability protect it from spoliation and ruin. They have sought the advice of able counsel, and, after mature deliberation, believe it their duty to disregard so much of said law as attempts arbitrarily to fix rates of compensation for freight and passengers.&amp;quot; The &amp;quot;Potter Law&amp;quot; was without precedent in the history of any state or country, disastrous in its effects and wholly uncalled for by anything this company had done or failed to do. Under these circumstances, the officers of this company not only believed they were justified, but that it was their duty to decline to conform to its re- quirements until its validity and binding force were declared by the courts. That decision has now been made. The act by its terms embraces all the lines operated by this company within this state, and all of its business except &amp;quot;for carrying freight which comes from beyond its boundaries and to be car- ried across or through the state.&amp;quot; As to so much of said act as relates to interstate business, that is, passenger and freight business crossing a state line, the counsel for the state appear to have regarded it as so manifestly unconstitutional that they have not asked the court to enforce it. But as to our local business, they hold it valid and bind- ing upon the company. We shall, therefore, as law abiding citizens, at once conform our action to said decision, and endeavor to obey it in good faith until it is reversed by the supreme court of the United States, or until the law is repealed by the legis- lature of the state. Since my communication to you, before referred to, I have discovered no reason to change the views therein expressed with respect to the&amp;quot; Potter Law,&amp;quot; aside from the question of its validity. To deal arbitrarily with a question of such magnitude, and to attempt un- der form of law to coerce the railroads to serve the public for inadequate compensation, must necessarily result in failure, and be productive of conse- quences no less unfortunate to the people of the state than to the railroad companies themselves. As an example of the reasons given in support of this law, I may refer to statements recently made, apparently on official authority, as to the value of the roads of this company, based on the cost of the half-built and half-equipped lines of twenty years ago. With equal justice and propriety might the farm. ing lands of to-day, the value of which these roads have done so much to enhance, he estimated with reference to their original cost of ten shillings per acre thirty years ago. No more money can now be obtained from any one, anywhere, for the con. struction of railways in Wisconsin, or for the providing of equipment for existing lines, and a stoppage of many contemplated improvements has be come a matter of necessity. All objects and motives on the part of the &quot; &apos;Executive and Legal Documents. 13 Suydam v. Moore, 8 Barbour, p. 538, was the case of an amendment or rather an act imposing additional obligations upon railroads as to cattle guards, and the court held that the right to legislate in that respect existed, and that the policy of the enactment could not be questioned in the courts. The Northern Railroad Co. v. Miller, 10 Barbour, p. 260, was an action to en- force payment of stock subscribed by the defendant, and resisted on the ground that the legislature had amended the charter of the company. The court held that the power to amend existed, and that the individual, by sub- scribing for the stock &quot;stipulates that the legislature may alter or repeal the law, and thus change the obligation or defeat it altogether.&quot; In Perrin v. Oliver, 1 Minn., p. 202, the court decided that an act granting a ferry franchise two miles in extent could be altered by the legislature and re- duced to one-fourth of a mile, under the reserved power to amend or repeal. And so in the Erie railroad cases, 26 and 27 Penn., the court held that the language of the reservation was to be construed strongly in favor of the state, and that under it the legislature had the right summarily to repeal the char- ter of the Erie railroad. In the matter of the Reciprocity Bank, 22 N. Y., p. 9, the charter of the bank was amended by imposing an individual liability on the stockholders, not provided for by the original charter, and the Court of Appeals held that by the reserved power, as a part of the contract, the state could amend the char- ter at will, reaffirming the matter of the Olive Lee Bank, 21 N. Y., p. 9. This last case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, and is re- ported in 1 Black, p. 587. The general banking law, under which this bank was organized, provided in express terms that no shareholder should be indi- vidually liable for any contract, debt or engagement of the corporation, and the articles of association contained a similar clause. The law also provided that the legislature might at any time alter or repeal the act. The plaintiff, Sherman, became a stockholder, and subsequently the legislature passed an act making shareholders personally liable for the debts of the association. The question raised, was whether the last act was in conflict with the consti- tution of the United States, which forbids a state to make any law i.npairing the obligation of contracts. All the courts of New York held that it was not, and the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the decision, Mr. Justice Nelson remarking: &quot;Now the 32d section, which reserved to the legislature the power to alter or repeal the act, by necessary construction reserved the power to alter or repeal all or any one of these terms and conditions or rules of liability prescribed in the act; the articles of association are de- pendent upon and become a part of, the law under which the bank was or- ganized, and subject to alterations or repeal, the same as any other part of the general system.&quot; In the Penn. College cases, 13 Wall., p. 190, Mr. Justice Clifford uses this language: &quot;Charters of private corporations are regarded as executed con- tracts between the government and the corporators, and the rule is well set- tled that the legislature cannot repeal, impair or alter such a charter against the consent, or without the default of the corporation, judicially ascertained and declared. Of course these remarks apply only to acts of incorporation which do not contain any reservations or provisions annexing conditions to the charter, modifying and limiting the nature of the contract. Cases often arise where the legislature, in granting an act of incorporation for a private purpose, either make the duration of the charter conditional, or reserve to the state the power to alter, modify or repeal the same at pleasure. Where such a provision is incorporated in the charter it is clear that it qualifies the grant, and that subsequent exercise of that reserved power, cannot be regarded as an act within the prohibition of the constitution.&quot; In the case of Tomlinson v. Jessup, 15 Wall., p. 454, the Northeastern Rail- road Company was incorporated in 1851 by the legislature of the state of North Carolina. At that time there was a general law of the state, passed in 1841, providing that the charter of every corporation should be subject to amendment, alteration or repeal by the legislature. In 1855 an act was passed by which the stock of the company and its real estate should be exempted from taxation, during the continuance of the charter, which was for the term of fifty years. In 1868 a constitution was adopted, in which it was provided that the property of all corporations should be subject to taxation.

It was part of the consideration for such guaranty that the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company should operate said road from year to year in order to indemnify said company for monies paid out, and liabilities in- curred by it.

The line of this road extended from Milwaukee via Waterford, Rochester and Burlington, down the valley of the Fox river, to the Illinois state line. In 1857 a conditional contract had been entered into with the Beloit and Mil- waukee Railroad Company to connect the two lines at a point eleven or twelve miles from the city of Milwaukee, and leaving to this company but 31½ miles to build from the point of connection to the state line. The subscrip- tions to capital stock at that date were: Individual subscriptions, $155,700; corporate subscriptions, $50,000; total, $205,700. Of this amount there had been received the following payments: cash, $15,260.92; farm mortgages per- fected, $38,600; 8 per cent. bonds of town of Burlington, $35,000; 8 per cent. bonds of the town of Rochester, $15,000. Total receipts, $103,960. Disburse- ments of the company to the same date had been: for engineering, $5,142 24; right of way, $2,822.75; grading, $15,528.08; superstructure and bridging, $4,140.11; interest, discount, office, incidental and other expenses, $4,672.47. Total expenditures, $32,355-65. The resources for further operations were: In- stallments on stock called for and unpaid, $47, 964.08; installments subject to call 1857, $32, 775.00; installments subject to call, 1858, $21,000.00; farm mort- gaged on hand perfected, $38,600; Burlington Bonds, $35,000.00; Rochester bonds, $15,000; Milwaukee city bonds, voted, $34,000; first mortgage bonds of road, at $10,000 per mile, $315,000. Total resources, $539,339.08. The cost of the road complete was estimated as follows: right of way, fencing, grubbing, grading, bridging and preparing road-bed for iron, $252,000; ties, chairs, spikes, laying track and ballasting, $55,125.00; iron, 60 lbs. per yard, $220,500.00. Total estimated cost-$527, 625.00-or $16,750.00 per mile. (Re- sponsible parties offered to furnish everything above enumerated, and to do the work specified for less than $16,000 per mile, payable monthly in cash). The additional expense for interest, exchange, discounts on securities, engi&apos; neering, salaries of officers, depot grounds and buildings, locomotives, cars and incidentals, was estimated at $200,000. All these estimates for construc- tion were based on actual explorations and survey, and were alleged to cover every contingency. &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 17 COST OF RAILROADS-Details from Reports of Companies for the year ending December 31, 1873.

Of the same type is the argument that Chap. 273 violates the contracts of these defendants with their creditors. This position appears to us to rest in the absurdity that the mortgagor can vest in his mortgagee a greater estate than he had himself. Perhaps the statute may lessen the means of payment of the defendants. So would a fine for homicide, under the police power of the state. But to lessen the means of payment of a contract, is not to impair the obligation of the contract. These defendants took their franchises, and their creditors invested their money, subject to the reserved power, and suffer no legal wrong when that is exercised. It was said that chapter 273 violates the rights of property of these defend- ants. We cannot perceive that it does. Whether it will lessen the income of their property, we cannot foresee. We only know that it does lessen their rates of toll But it does not wrongfully touch their property. As far as the franchise is to be considered property, it was subject to this very limitation; and the limitation is the exercise of a right over it, which does not violate it. The right of limitation, entered into the property, and qualified it. And the act does not at all meddle with the material property, distinct from the franchise. It acts only on the franchise, not at all upon the material property. And it is sufficient to say that they acquired the material property, as dis- tinct from the franchise, subject to the alteration of the franchise under the reserved power. That was a condition, under which they chose to hold their property; and they have no right to complain when the condition is enforced. Their rights in their material property are inviolate, and shall never be vio- lated with the sanction of this court. But they are no more violated by this act, and its enforcement, than by foreclosure of a mortgage or ejectment by paramount title. It is a right over property which is enforced, not a wrong to right in property. We listened to a good deal of denunciation of chapter 273, which we think was misapplied. We do not mean to say that the act is not open to criticism. We only say that such criticism is unfounded. It was said that its provisions, which have been noticed, were not within the scope of the legislative func- tion; as if every compilation of statutes, everywhere, in all time, did not contain provisions limiting and regulating tolls; as if the very franchise altered were not a rebuke to such clamor. It was repeated with a singular confusion of ideas and a singular perversion of terms, that the provisions of the chapter amount to an act of confiscation; a well defined term in the law, signifying the appropriation, by the state, to itself, for its own use, as upon forfeiture, of the whole thing confiscated. It was denounced as an act of communism. We thank God that communism is a foreign abomination, without recognition or sympathy here. The people of Wisconsin are too in- telligent, too staid, too just, too busy, too prosperous, for any such horror of doctrine; for any leaning towards confiscation or communism. And these wild terms are as applicable to a statute limiting the rates of toll on railroads, as the term murder is to the surgeon&apos;s wholesome use of the knife, to save life, not to take it. Such objections do not rise to the dignity of argument. They belong to that order of grumbling against legal duty and legal liability, which would rail the seal from off the bond. They were not worty of the able and learned counsel who repeated them, and are hardly worthy even of this notice in a judicial opinion. We have, according to our duty, dealt with the questions we have consid- ered, as questions of law. We cannot judge of the policy or the fairness of the act. That is for the legislature. We can only say that it is the law. We cannot judge of the propriety of these informations. That is for the law of ficers of the state. We are only to determine what the law is, and to adminis- ter it as we find it, in causes over which we have no other control. And we can join in no outry against the law, which it is our duty to administer. Neither can we countenance any outcry against the railroads. We cannot consider any popular excitement against them warranted or useful. The rail- roads have their rights, and so have the people. Whatever usurpation or abuses, if any, the railroad companies may be guily of, can find a remedy in calm, just, appropriate legislation. And this court will firmly and impar- tially protect all the rights of the railroads and of the people, in all litigation which may come here. But we can take no part in popular outcry against these companies, or countenance any prejudice against them. We indorse &quot; &quot;Records of Railway Companies. 127 President of the Illinois &amp;amp; Wisconsin Railroad Company, who is known to me to be the person whose name is subscribed to the foregoing articles of consolidation or agreement, who, being by me duly sworn, deposes and says that he resides in the city of Chicago, in the said county of Cook, that he is President of the Illinois &amp;amp; Wisconsin Railroad Company, that he knows the corporate seal of said company, that the seal affixed to the foregoing instru- ment of writing is the corporate seal of said company, that it was affixed by order of said company, and he signed his name to said instrument, by like order, as president of said company.

The pontoons when in this position or open,&quot; &quot;leave a clear passage for the requirements of navigation, of four hundred feet, a passage double the distance of that of any other draw across the Mississippi river. The cost of the bridge when fully completed, will be about $150,000. The transfer toll over it is fixed by contract at one dollar per car. The capacity for business is as great as would be that of any other single track bridge on the same location, and it is as safe. The bridge has received, in various written testimonials, and otherwise, the approval of the representatives of the leading river interests and the indorsement, besides, of the United States government through its engi- neer, Gen. Humphrey, who reports it to the War Department, &quot;exceptionally free from objection on account of its obstruction to navigation.&quot; Acts legal- izing and establishing it were passed last winter by the legislature of Wiscon- sin, and by congress. The exclusive right to the use of this style of bridge is secured to me by letters patent. &quot;&quot; The only improvement required, and one which is about being made, is the adoption of long &quot; aprons on approaches, in place of short ones now in use.

Now therefore be it known, that we, the undersigned purchasers as afore- said, being desirous of forming a corporation under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Wisconsin, do hereby associate together for that purpose and do hereby declare the following to be the certificate or articles of associ ation, and we execute the same in duplicate to the end that one may be filed in the office of the secretary of state for the state of Wisconsin, and the other to remain in the records of our corporation as a record of our corporate rights, privileges and immunities.

PAUL RAILWAYS. M. PEDRICK TO THE COMMISSIONERS. FAIRCHILD, Wis., October 16, 1874. Railroad Commissioners: GENTLEMEN:-The West Wisconsin Railroad still continues to charge $15 per car load on lumber to Camp Douglass Junction; and the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad commences at that place to compute and charge on its road. Is there to be any change? This rate makes an overcharge of $9 per car load on one hundred and fifty miles. I would further inquire in reference to shipping wheat from this station to Milwaukee. The road charges 25 cents per hundred pounds, when the distance computed makes it 22 cents per hun- dred, when shipped by the shortest route. But this road will not allow us to ship over the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, preferring to take it through to Madison and Harvard Junction, and back to Milwaukee. Is there any remedy for this? Yours respectfully, M. PEDRICK. COMMISSIONER HOYT TO M. PEDRICK. October 18, 1874. M. PEDRICK, Esq., Fairchild: * DEAR SIR: - In answer to your favor of the 16th, I have to say: (1). * * The refusal of the M. &amp;amp; St. P. Co. to compute the distance from the point where the freight is first received will render them liable to penalties. (2.) That, inasmuch as the W. W. R. R. and the C. &amp;amp; N. W. R. R. have been running in connection, the latter hauling the freight received from the former via Madison, Harvard and Kenosha to Milwaukee, there would probably be no complaint made of their continuing to do so, provided the shipper should not be required to pay any extra charge on account of extra distance over the shorter route via M. &amp;amp; St. P. R. R. to the same point. If no objection were made by the shipper or consignee to such round about shipment, it is possible that the courts would decide that the companies hauling the freight were privileged to give it the usual course of shipment. But nothing is clearer to my own mind, and I doubt not that the other commissioners would agree with the opinion if they were present, than that the shipper has a right to dictate the route which his freight shall take. You certainly have the right to ship via M. &amp;amp; St. P. R. R., and cannot be legally required to pay more than the rates prescribed by ch. 273 of the laws of 1874, for the distance from Fairchild to Milwaukee, regardless of the fact that the freight passes over two lines. 5-R. R.-Doc. &quot; &quot;32 Report of Railroad Commissioners. than to let the cars go too far away, and a movement of the same kind is on foot in this country. As these roads multiply, the improvements in the methods of tranship- ment, and in the construction of the cars to accommodate each to the other in a relative proportion, will be made. But supposing it costs 10 cents a ton to transfer, after having been transported on an average, say 100 miles, we claim that the narrow-gauge road could bear the whole expense, and still beat a competing line, as to actual cost of hauling. For in the discussion last winter in the Iowa legislature, it was shown that the cost of freight on the standard gauge was 1½ cents per ton per mile, while it is conceded that on the improved gauge freight can be transported for a cent a mile per ton. It is contended that the road, if completed from Milwaukee on a narrow gauge, would receive a paying business from local traffic alone, as the aver- age distance from any other road would be perhaps 10 miles, and through a fine agricultural country. We think the people of Milwaukee, with the assistance that could be ob- tained along the line, could build the road as a three-foot one, and without doubt, at no distant day, it would become a part of a great through line from the grain fields of the west. Most respectfully yours, J. H. STERNS, Chief Engineer of the proposed Mil. &amp;amp; South W. N. G. R. R. Co. PRESIDENT ALEX. MITCHELL TO COMMISSIONER PAUL. MILWAUKEE, Nov. 20, 1874. Hon. GEO. H. PAUL, Commissioner of Railroads, Wis.: MY DEAR SIR:—In consequence of the representations of Mr. Osborn and yourself, yesterday, the day passenger train between Madison and here has been restored as it was before the recent change, except a slight difference in time. West of Madison the train will be as now, mixed. In point of fact, the passenger traine on the Prairie du Chien road are hardly paying expenses. Please inform Mr. Osborn. Yours truly, ALEX. MITCHELL, President. INQUIRY CONCERNING RAILROAD LANDS. (Answers tabulated under head of Railway Statistics.) OFFICE OF RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS, MADISON, Nov. 30, 1874. DEAR SIR:-Will you be kind enough to furnish this board with a state- &quot; &apos;Official Papers and Correspondence. 53 from Oshkosh. Have tendered the agent here the legal freight, and made demand for lumber, but they refuse to accept the freight and are holding my lumber. What shall I do in order to get my lumber? Please answer and oblige yours, J. L. ROOD. OFFICE OF RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS, MADISON, November 16, 1874. J. L. ROOD, Esq.: DEAR SIR:-Owing to my absence on official business in the northern part of the state, and the fact that your letter of the 13th was addressed to me per- sonally, it has been on my table since Saturday. You have two remedies-one to pay the charges under protest, and after- wards recover the excess; the other to replevy your lumber in the usual way. Since writing the foregoing I have heard from Attorney General Sloan, that he has received official assurances from the officers of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, that from this time forward they will adopt our construction of the law as to the computation of the charges—namely, that rates shall be computed from the point where the freight was first received. This being the case, it is presumed that the agent at your place has already received instructions to deliver your lumber on payment of the legal rates. If not, please inform us of the fact, that we may bring it to the notice of the company. Respectfully yours, JOHN W. HOYT, Railroad Commissioner. J. L. ROOD TO COMMISSIONER HOYT. JOHN W. HOYT, Railroad Commissioner: MONROE, Nov. 19, 1874. DEAR SIR: I received your letter of November 16th. The agent here had just received instructions to release my lumber and accept the legal rates. I am under obligations to you for the attention you have given to my letters, and the interest you have taken in the matter. Yesterday I received a telegram from O. E. Britt, saying, &quot;We cannot haul your cars from Janesville for two dollars. Why do you not ship all the way on our road?&quot; It is not convenient for me to ship all my lumber on C. M. and St. P. R. R. Some of it comes from Fond du Lac. That must come by the N. W. R. R. to Janesville. When I can ship from Oshkosh by C., M. &amp;amp; St. P. R. R. I am willing to do so. Yours, very truly, J. L.

With the purpose of facilitating a more complete investigation of the inter-state relations of our railway system in future, and of promoting uniformity in classification and legislation, in August last, the Wisconsin commissioners accepted an invitation to meet the commissioners of Illinois and Minnesota, at Dubuque. A sec- ond meeting was held at Madison in September, and a third is ap- pointed to be held at Springfield. The practical utility of this method of informal co-operation cannot be over-estimated. AMENDED FORM OF RAILWAY REPORTS. Among the fruits of the consultations held, is the adoption of a form of railway report, substantially uniform as to time and char- acter for the several states represented. This form is embraced in the Appendix of this report, and will be found to require from the railroad companies a methodical statement of every material fact of public concern bearing either upon the local or general affairs of the railway corporations. Substantially this form is already in force in the states of Illinois and Minnesota, and public action the ensuing year will be largely determined by the information thus ascertained. It is earnestly recommended that the modification of the annual reports of companies we have suggested, especially as to the mat- ter of date, be hereafter enforced by law. It should be under- stood, however, that the adoption of the form and date of annual report to the commissioners as stated, has no reference to the date or form of annual report of gross receipts to the State Treasurer, upon which last mentioned report is predicated the annual charge for licenses. UNIFORMITY IN CLASSIFICATION AND LEGISLATION. The efforts made by the Commissioners for promoting uniformity in the classification of freights, and also in general railway legisla- &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 107 Railway in 1873, was $18,749,500, secured on the following lines of railroad owned by the consolidated Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company: From Chicago, Ill., to Negaunee, Michigan. From Chicago, Ill., to the east bank of the Mississippi river, opposite Clinton, Iowa. From Turner Junction to Freeport, Ill. From Kenosha, Wis., to Rockford, Ill. From Belvidere, Ill., to a junction with the La Crosse, Trempealeau and Prescott Railroad in Wisconsin. From Elgin, Ill., to Geneva Lake, Wis., including the Elgin and State Line, and the State Line and Union Railroads. A description of the bonds secured on the above lines of road is contained in the following table: &quot; &quot;74 Report of Railroad Commissioners. &amp;quot;PART VII. RAILWAY MATTERS. &amp;quot;ART. 41. Such railways as are deemed necessary, either for the defence of Germany or the public intercourse, may be constructed by virtue of an imperial law on account of the empire, notwithstanding any opposition of members of the confederation, without prejudice, however, to territorial rights of sovereignty, or may be conceded for execution to private contrac- tors, and invested with the right of expropriation. Every existing railway administration is bound to consent to new railways being connected with their own at the expense of the former. The legal dispositions granting to existing railway undertakings the right to enterdict the construction of parallel or compcting railways, are hereby abolished for the whole empire, without prejudice to rights already acquired. No such right of interedict can be hereafter granted in future concessions. &amp;quot;ART. 42. The governments of the confederation engage, in the interest of the public traffic, to cause the German railways to be administered as one system, and for this purpose all new railways are to be constructed and equipped according to uniform rules. &amp;quot;ART. 43. Consequently, uniform working arrangements shall as far as possible be laid down, and especially uniform Jailway police regulations in- troduced. The Empire will take care to provide that the railways are con- stantly maintained by their administrations, in a proper state so as to guar- antee their safety, and also that they have the full complement of working ma- terial as needed for the public service. 66 &apos;ART. 44. The railway administrations are bound to establish as many passenger trains, with corresponding rapidity, as are needed for the transit traffic, and to make the proper time arrangements corresponding to each oth- er, also to establish goods&apos; trains in sufficient number having regard to the traffic, also to arrange in return for the usual remuneration, through passen- gers&apos; and goods&apos; trains, allowing the rolling stock to pass from one railway to the other. &amp;quot;ART. 45. The Empire is charged with the control of all matters of tariff; it will especially provide: &amp;quot;(1) That uniform working regulations, as soon as possible, be established for all German railways. &amp;quot;(2) That the greatest possible uniformity and reduction of the tariff shall take place, especially, that for greater distances, a reduced tariff, correspond- ing to the wants of agriculture and industry, be introduced for the transport of coals, coke, wood, ore, stones, salt, pig-iron, manure, and similar objects, and, in the first instance, so far as possible, the one pfennig tariff. &amp;quot;ART. 46. For times of public calamities, especially of dearness of the necessaries of life, the railway administrations are bound to establish, tem- porarily, for the transport especially of corn, flour, husk fruits and potatoes, a lower special tariff corresponding to the want, to be fixed by the Emperor on the proposition of the proper committees of the Bundesrath, which tariff, however, must not be lower than the lowest rates in force on the respective rail way for raw produce. &quot; &quot;92 Appendix. however, to the following liens and incumbrances thereon, to-wit: A mort- gage to Francis A. Palmer for $950,000 with interest thereon at 8 per cent. per annum since May 1, 1866; two mortgages to the city of Milwaukee for $314,000 with interest thereon from the 1st day of September, 1866; a mort- gage to Greene C. Bronson and James T. Soutter for $1,000,000, with interest at 8 per cent. per annum from March 1, 1866, and judgment rendered in fa- vor of Selah Chamberlain, in the district court of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, on the 2d day of October, 1857, for $629,105.22, and a certain lease given to said Chamberlain as security for the amount of said judgment.

Amount of decree, $896,600.84, for inter- est. Amount of principal of bonds, $2,794,000. All and singular the several tracts, pieces or parcels of land which now are or may hereafter be or constitute the site of the roadway, turnouts, engine houses, workshops, depots and other buildings, and all the other lands and real estate which now constitute, or may hereafter constitute or be a part of the roads of said railroad company from Madison by way of Portage City, to the St. Croix river or lake, between townships twenty-five and thirty-one, and from Portage City to La Crosse; and also all and singular the super- structure of said road, whether now made or to be made bereafter, and &quot; &apos;The Problem to be Solved. 69 This committee labored hard, but accomplished little more than to increase the general concern as to the growing power of mo- nopolies; to bring to light the important fact that virtual amalga- mations in the form of private arrangements, outside of the pro- visions of law, were common, and to urge the imperative necessity of constituting a department of the executive government, to have supervision of railways and canals, with full power to enforce such regulations as may from time to time appear indispensable for the accommodation and general interests of the public.&quot; 66 In pursuance of this recommendation, an act was that year pass- ed constituting &quot;The Railway Commission,&quot; consisting of five per- sons; the president, to be paid $10,000 a year, two other members at $7,500 each, and two unpaid members; the president and the two unpaid members to have the right to seats in Parliament. 9 In 1847, was established the voluntary asssociation of the repre- sentatives of railway companies, known as &quot;The Railway Clearing House.&quot; It was established for the purpose of regulating matters of joint traffic between the companies having connection therewith. This association, legalized in 1850, has gradually come to embrace all the important companies of England, and has been eminently serviceable in producing uniformity and efficiency of management. The speculative power of former years having somewhat abated, in 1851, the railway commission was abolished; the duties being re- transferred to the Board of Trade. Two years later, howeyer, the fever revived, strife among the great companies became more active than ever, and the pressure of bills again made it necessary to refer the matter to a select com- mittee. This committee, Mr. Cardwell being chairman, made, in all, five reports; the last one being especially elaborate in its dis- cussion of amalgamation and interchange of traffic. Their recom- mendations on the last head resulted in what is styled &quot;The Canal and Railway Traffic Act,&quot; passed in 1854-a very important one, in that it establishes the principles: (1) that every company should be compelled to afford to the public, in respect both of goods and of passengers, the full advantage of convenient interchange from one system of railway to another; and (2) that every company should make equal charges under the same circumstances. This act is faulty, in that the remedy, in case of infraction, lies in an appeal from the injured party to the court of common pleas, &apos; &quot;52 Report of Railroad Commissioners. J. L. ROOD TO COMMISSIONER HOYT. JOHN W. HOYT, Railroad Commissioner: MONROE, Nov. 9, 1874. DEAR SIR: I inclose you a deposition which I have made out in relation to railroad charges on lumber which I have had shipped. I would state also, that when the last six cars of lumber were received, I went to the agent here and tendered him the legal freight, which he counted and then returned to me, declining to accept it. He telegraphed to Milwau- kee to find out what he should do, and the reply he received from O. E. Britt I enclose to you. Is it better for me to let them unload the cars if they will not take the legal rate, or shall I still continue to receive them as usual, and pay what they charge? They understand that I receive all these cars under protest. Please answer and oblige, Yours truly, COPY OF THE TFLEGRAM TO MR. ROOD. J. L. ROOD. MILWAUKEE, Nov. 7. P. W. P.: Unload the lumber. Add cost of unloading to the charges. [Letter acknowledged, and referred to the Attorney General.] O. E. B. ATTORNEY GENERAL SLOAN TO JOHN W. CARY, ESQ. MADISON, NOV. 10, 1874. JOHN W. CARY, Esq., DEAR SIR: Some complaint is made that your company has charged, and are charging $13 per car for transporting lumber by the car-load (shipped at Oshkosh) from Janesville to Monroe, Wisconsin. As I construe chapter 273, laws of 1874, this is a clear violation of that law and of the injunction issued by the Supreme Court. If this complaint is well founded, we shall be compelled to proceed as for contempt against the officers of the company. I deem it proper to inform you of this complaint, that you may correct the practice of the company in this respect, or make any explanation of the charge that the company may desire, before proceedings are commenced. Yours truly, A. SCOTT SLOAN, Attorney General. MONROE, November, 13, 1874. TO JOHN W. HOYT, Railroad Commissioner: DEAR SIR: Since writing you I have had five or six cars of lumber shipped &quot; &quot;Official Papers and Correspondence. 63 dispatch just received from Mr. Osborn, until the receipt of Mr. Osborn&apos;s letter, and until a fuller understanding can be had. Yours truly, B. C. COOK, Gen. Solicitor. ATTORNEY GENERAL SLOAN TO SOLICITOR B. C. COOK. HON. B. C. COOK: MADISON, November 13, 1874. DEAR SIR:-Yours of the 11th inst. duly received, and is satisfactory in regard to the case mentioned. The St. Paul Company has, in some instances, charged higher rates than the Potter Law allows, where freight is transferre to their roads, claiming that their receipt of it was a new receipt, and that they had the right to charge as for a first haul. But Messrs. Mitchell, Cary and Merrill were here yesterday and they agreed to adopt the construction held by the supreme court in Ackley and Vilas vs. Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company. The court simply held in that case that where freight is carried by two or more roads the rates are to be computed in the same way as though carried upon but one road. They do not decide what would be a proper division of the freight earned by the connecting roads. On this subject they say: &amp;quot;We are aware of no statute which assumes to give the whole freight to one company and thus compel the other to render services without compensation. We are of the opinion that $15 per car load is the highest rate of freight that can lawfully be demanded for the whole carriage, and that the same should be divided between the two railway com- panies, on some equitable principle, to be determined by the courts in case the companies invoke the aid of the courts in the premises.&amp;quot; Nobody is perhaps at liberty to assume what that equitable principle of division of freight earnings, to which the court refers, will be. But if the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company would adopt your circular on its roads, I do not see why all cause of embarrassment and difficulty would not be re- moved; and, without intending to express an opinion on that subject, my impression is that the division on the principle stated in your circular, that is, a pro-rata of freight earnings according to distance carried, is as equitable as any that could be applied. Very truly yours, A. SCOTT SLOAN, Attorney General. GEN. MANAGER H. H. PORTER TO COMMISSIONER OSBORN. CHICAGO AND NORTHWESLERN RAILWAY, Office of General Manager, CHICAGO, NOV. 18, 1874. DEAR SIR: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 16th &quot; &quot;6 Appendix. It will be evident to your Excellency that something beyond the bare work- ing expenses of a road must be secured. The interest upon its bonds must be met. The tariff named in the act, applied to our business, would not yield the requisite sum after paying operating expenses. Can the latter be reduced? The company employs several thousand men in Wisconsin, none of whom are extravagantly paid. Were we to enforce a reduction in their wages cor- responding to that attempted to be made in our tariff, a general strike would immediately ensue, and the public would justify the men. Clearly, then, expenses cannot be reduced in that way. The next item of magnitude is the cost of renewing and maintaining the track, building and equipment. We are obliged to furnish the best appointment known to the service, otherwise the courts mulct us in heavy damages for neglect. Therefore no opportunity for a reduction in this respect is afforded. In proof of the company&apos;s willingness to reduce its tariff as rapidly and consistently as possible, the following statement of the rate charged for the past seven years is presented; to which we may add that the dividends paid stockholders have never been increased proportionally to the reductions made in the tariff, nor have they ever exceeded the rate of interest allowed by your state law: Earnings per Earnings per passenger ton freight per mile. per mile. For the year ending May 31, 1867 For the year ending May 31, 1868 For the year ending May 31, 1869 For the year ending May 31, 1870 $0 0318% 04130 $0 0310 03100 * * 29 03.31 03100 080 For the year ending May 31, 1871 03780 100 28 02,61 03180 16 For the year ending May 31, 1872 For the year ending May 31, 1873 ---- 87 02100 100 02100 This constant reduction grew out of the enlarged and improved facilities of the company for moving trains and transacting business, the benefits from which were invariably given to the public, and not reserved for the stockholders. Should Your Excellency be desirous of confirming the correctness of these statements, every facilty will be afforded the person or persons whom you may designate for that purpose. We court this investigation, in the assurance that, were the people possessed of all the facts in the case, they would de- mand the immediate repeal of the statutes which premeditate such gross injustice. For we cannot believe that, in the full light of all the circum- stances, the intelligent citizens of Wisconsin would perpetrate a wrong which, if enforced, would virtually confiscate a property that has con- tributed as much, perhaps more, than any other enterprise, to the growth and prosperity of their state. The fact that this railroad cannot be operated upon the schedule of rates contained in the acts referred to, without incurring heavy loss, as well as rendering it impossible to pay the interest upon its bonded debt, or dividends to its stockholders, places its managers in a very embarrassing position. Had the power to afford relief been vested in the commissioners, whom Your Excellency is to appoint, we should have waited and presented our case to them; but, that discretion being withheld from them, we have thought it proper to lay before Your Excellency a statement of the facts known to us, and which, we believe, were not fully known to, nor appreciated by, the Legislature when the acts referred to were passed. Very respectfully, ALBERT KEEP, President. *The records for 1869 were destroyed in the Chicago fire, and cannot be reproduced. &quot; &quot;Gross Earnings of Railways in 1873. 23 Inasmuch as the income to the state from railroads is directly affected by this apportionment, the accuracy of the return becomes a matter of special importance. The brief time allowed the com- mission has rendered it impracticable to pursue this branch of the investigation to that extent which the interests of the state de- mand. The correctness of all past apportionment made by the Chicago and Northwestern Company depends entirely upon the faith of the company. That of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Company is based upon detailed statements of the earnings of the several branches of the road lying within this state, and accords with the gross receipts of the lines as given in the printed reports of the president and directors to the stockholders of the company, and entered upon the books of the company, with the exception that the report of gross earnings to the state is a certain sum less than the sum of gross earnings of the company in the state, as shown by the books of the company for the same year. This difference is substantially the difference between the earnings of the road proper inside the state, and the earnings of the com- pany inside the state including the earnings from Milwaukee elevators and those credited to ferriage across the Mississippi river at Prairie du Chien. PAYMENTS FOR DIVIDENDS, INTEREST AND NEW CONSTRUCTION. The following facts of general importance appear from the reports of the companies for the year 1873: 1. Two roads only-the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul, and the Chicago and Northwestern-actually paid, or were able to pay, dividends on stock. 2. The aggregate amount paid from earnings for interest on debt, by all the roads, was $4,608.839.29—an average of less than 5½ per cent. on the total debt. 3. The whole amount paid and reported as cost of new construc- tion during the year 1873, amounted to $4,962,770.16, which whole sum was paid on account of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul, and the Chicago and Northwestern, or for road operated by them, except the sum of $302,222 reported by the Green Bay and Minne- sota Company, and the sum of $142,710.31, reported by the West Wisconsin Company. Accepting the reports of the companies as authority, these facts clearly demonstrate that with the exception of the two main rail- &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 135 1870 | 1st M. 71% 8914 92 ...do 89 92 Iowa &amp;amp; Minn. 82 85 2283 89 8014 8888 9112 8934 92 913% 92 92 92 9194 9434 89 93 9312 9412 95 94 88 86 90 86 87 86 87 86 85 86 82 86 821/2 84 2d Mort 1871 1st M. 8s.. 105 106 1025% 103 10334 1044 105 106% 106 ...do..71% 9312 9494 9112 93 9334 95 95 9814 97 10794 98 ...do 91 92 92 9212 93 94 94 954 95% 9614 Iowa &amp;amp; Minn. 85 8712 87 871/2 87 89 88 901/2 ཚ:33་མངཚོ 9474 95 89 8212 84 10712 97 9712 9012 981/2 98 93 2d Mort 85 88 87 8714 86 884 84 87 87 89 87 8814 1872 1st M. 8s 108½ 1104 1064 1074 107 10712 106 107 10712 108 107 108 ...do..7% 9514 98 92 9412 93 95 95 96 96 96 97 98 · 1st Mort.

The company executed its mortgage, pledging the lands covered by the grant; the bonds had been negotiated on the faith of the land grant security. The first step in perfecting the title to the lands, after 20 continuous miles have been completed, is the certificate of the Governor upon which the selec- tion contemplated by the acts cited, is based. The road was sold by United States Marshal, 25th April, 1863, to Wm. H. White and Wm. W. Pratt, who filed articles of association with the Secretary of State on May 5, 1863, as the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company. These articles of association provided that the new company should have all the rights of the La Crosse and Milwaukee Company to all or any part of the lands which had been or might thereafter be granted or acquired from the United States to aid in the construction of railroads. All moneys derived from the sale of lands to be paid to the trustees of cer- tain mortgage bonds, which were to be received at par, and accrued interest, in payment for lands. June 20, 1863, A. Finch, Jr., addressed a letter to Gov. Salomon in behalf of the Milwaukee and St. Paul R&apos;y Co., as the purchasers of the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad, Western Division, under a foreclosure sale of the land grant mortgage, so called, on that division, and requested him &amp;quot;to issue the proper certificate for the land which the said company was entitled to by virtue of the purchase.&amp;quot; August 1, 1863, A. Finch, Jr., again addresses Gov. Salomon, saying: &amp;quot;Yours of 1st received, in which you refuse to issue the certificate as re- quested by the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Co.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Is your mind fully and unalterably made up?&amp;quot; Chapter 446, of P. &amp;amp; L. Laws of 1868, approved March 6, 1868, entitled an act to incorporate the Wisconsin Railroad Farm Mortgage Land Company, re- cites as follows: WHEREAS, Certain owners of farms and other lands in this state mortgaged the same to aid in building the railroads now or recently known as the &amp;quot; La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad,&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot; Milwaukee and Horicon Railroad,&amp;quot; by reason of which the said mortgagors have suffered great injury; and WHEREAS, The &amp;quot;Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company,&amp;quot; the suc- cessors of the above named railroad companies, and the present owners of their lines of railroads, is willing to relinquish in favor of said mortgagors its claims to certain lands donated by congress to aid in the construction of said railroads, and more especially its claim to all and singular the lands to which they are or may be entitled by reason or on account of the building or construction of a railroad from Columbus, in the state of Wisconsin, by the way of Portage City, to Tomah, in said state of Wisconsin, by virtue of an act of congress, entitled &amp;quot;an act granting a portion of the public lands to the state of Wisconsin, to aid in the construction of railroads,” approved &quot; &apos;Evils of Railway Construction and Management. 59 would seem as though at least the ordinary precaution of seeing that this munificent grant had not been needlessly mismanaged would have been taken by the state, especially as section 3 of the act making the grant contains the admonitory provision, &quot;That the said lands hereby granted to said state shall be subject to the dis- disposal of the legislature thereof, for the purposes aforesaid, and no other.&quot; This subject is of special interest at this time in view of the ju- dicial decision lately rendered in Illinois, in which it is laid down as a rule &quot;that directors of railroad companies were not absolute in their powers; that they were but trustees to manage the estate of stockholders, and could no more abuse their trust, or waste and squander the property of the stockholders than could any trustee or executor, or other person charged with a fiduciary duty.&quot; The lands are received by the state as a trust, and are confided to the company to carry it into operation. The state, therefore, is responsible to the people for the faithful application of the trust. The state provides that while the lands are under its care, no part of the same shall be depredated upon, and that they shall be pre- served intact for the purposes for which they were donated. It would seem still more necessary that the duty so assumed should be supplemented by a careful supervision of the same after the disposal of the grant, and until the final application of the proceeds therefrom is made, adequate security should be required for such faithful appli- cation. Indeed, in the spirit of the decision above referred to, if there should appear a reasonable apprehension that the lands do- nated had been diverted, wasted, or squandered, it may well be con sidered if it be not the further duty of the state to require such equitable adjustment thereof as a judicial investigation should de- termine. The true disposition of these public donations was evidently in- tended to be expressed by Wm. B. Ogden, Esq., President of the Chicago, St. Paul and Fond du Lac R. R. Co. (now Chicago and Northwestern), in a memorial to the legislature of Wisconsin in September, 1856, when making application to the state for lands, in which he says: &quot;That in building the roads, they are willing that the citizens and state of Wisconsin should have and enjoy the entire benefit, profit and advantage of this munificent gift of lands to the state from the federal government, without any benefit or advantage to &apos; &quot;46 Appendix. 1 jurisdiction in cases of public nuisance, in the only case in which it had been exercised, that is, in cases of encroachment on the King&apos;s soil, had lain dormant for a century and a half; that is, from Charles I. down to the year 1795. Yet the jurisdiction has been finally sustained, upon the principle that equity can give more adequate and complete relief than can be obtained at law. Whilst, therefore, it is admitted by all, that it is one of delicacy, and accordingly the instances of its exercise are rare, yet it may be exercised in those cases in which there is imminent danger of irreparable mischief before the tradiness of the law could reach it.&amp;quot; These views were adopted by the United States circuit court of Michigan, in the same year, on a bill of injunction against a nuisance. The court as- serts both branches of the jurisdiction in equity, and says: &amp;quot;No individual has a right to prosecute for a public nuisance, in his own name or at his own instance, in this form of action, unless the nuisance be irreparably injurious to himself. The United States, through their law offi- cer, might well ask to have this nuisance, if it shall be one, abated; but the special and private injury to an individual is the only ground on which he can ask relief against it.&amp;quot; Spooner v. McConnell, 1 Me Lean, 337. And the same views were again recognized and affirmed by the supreme court of the United States, in 1851, in Pennsylvania v. Wheeling Bridge Co., 13. Howard, 518. The same question came before the supreme court of Pennsylvania in 1854, at the suit of the Attorney General against a railroad company, to restrain them from filling up a canal in the construction of their road, under their franchise. The court says: &amp;quot;The boldness of this act seems almost like a studied test of the vigilance of the canal commissioners, and of the efficiency of the remedies which the state has provided for the prevention of injuries. It is hoped that the equity remedy, being somewhat unusual and peremptory in its character, will not be applied to an act which does so little injury. But writs of capias, replev- in, foreign and domestic attachment, estrepement, prohibition and habeas corpus, are quite as efficient and peremptory in their power, and most of them much more easily obtained, and yet they are common law writs. And estrepement applies to many of the same cases as injunction, and may issue without bail. And so it was once with the prohibition. In most of the cases, moreover, in which we hear this objection to the injunction, the com- mon law allows more speedy remedy, for it permits the injured party to re- dress himself by driving off the wrong-doer. &amp;quot;The argument that there is no irreparable damage would not be so often used by wrong-doers, if they would take the trouble to observe that the word &apos;irreparable&apos; is a very unhappily chosen one, used in expressing the rule that an injunction may issue to prevent wrongs of a repeated and continuing character, or which occasion damages which are estimable only by conjec- ture and not by any accurate standard. 3 Railway Cases, 106, 345; id., 186; 1 Sim and Stuart, 607; 3 Atkins, 21; 3 Johns, ch. 501; 16 Pick., 525; 3 Whar- ton, 513. As this argument is generally presented, it seems to be supposed that injunctions can apply only to very great injuries; and it would follow that he who has not much property to be injured, cannot have this protec- tion for the little he has. &amp;quot;Besides this, where the right invaded is secured by statute or by contract, there is generally no question of the amount of damage, but simply of the right. He who grants a right cannot take it away, even on giving a better, without a new agreement for the purpose. 19 Eng. L. &amp;amp; E., 287; 16 Pick., 525; 4 Simons, 13; 8 Weed, 99; 8 Paige, 351; 2 Swanston, 253. And such was our decision in the late case of the Western Saving Fund Co. v. Philadel- phia. &amp;quot;And so it is where the public rights are invaded. In the case of the At- torney General v. The Cahoes Co., 6 Paige, 133, there was an offer to tap the state canal for a mill purpose, and it was stopped by injunction, without any regard to evidence tending to disprove damage. And in Downing v. McFad- den, 18 State R., 334, we justified the keepers of the public works in abating a house that encroached upon the enbankment of a railroad, though a jury had found that it did no injury. &amp;quot;And when railroad companies or individuals exceed their statutory pow- &quot; &quot;226 Report of Railroad Comwiissioners.

THE ILLINOIS TO THE WISCONSIN COMMISSIONERS. OFFICE OF RAILROAD AND WAREHOUSE COMMISSIONERS, SPRINGFIELD, July 13, 1874. SIR: We have for some time entertained the belief that a meeting for con- ference of the Railroad Commissioners of this and the surrounding states would be of great advantage to those participating therein, and therefore very respectfully suggest that the Railroad Commissioners of Iowa, Minne- sota, Wisconsin and Illinois meet at some central point-say Dubuque, Iowa- about the 10th of August, for the purpose of an interchange of opinions per- taining to the railroad laws of the several states mentioned, and such other matters as may have a bearing upon the subjects with which it is made our duty to consider in our official capacity. Before taking any further steps in the direction indicated, we would be pleased to have a full expression from your commission as to the propriety, in your judgment, of holding such conference. I am, very respectfully yours, Hon. JOSEPH H. OSBORN, JNO. M. PEARSON, Chairman R. R. Com. Illinois. Chairman R. R. Commissioners of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis. THE WISCONSIN TO THE ILLINOIS COMMISSIONERS. MADISON, July 17, 1874. Hon. JNO. M PEARSON, Chairman R. R. Commissioners of Illinois: SIR: Yours of the 12th inst., proposing a meeting of the Railroad Commis- sioners of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois, is at hand. In reply, we would state that the purpose meets with the cordial approval of this board, your call anticipating previous similar action which we had considered and decided upon. We regard the course you suggest as not only entirely proper and judicious, but a matter of necessity prompted by existing circumstances. We shall await positive notice of the time and place you may select for the meeting, and will arrange to be present. Very respectfully yours, WISCONSIN RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS. By J. H. OSBORN. P. S.-We have no permanent chairman. &quot; &apos;Errors of Past Legislation. 91 THR PEOPLE NOT FREE FROM CENSURE. The public itself is, therefore, by no means free from censure in this particular. The history of railway legislation in this state is unsurpassed for the indifference manifested to every public or private right and duty in this connection. The earlier enactments of the legislature bear evidence of the disposition to some pru- dence and devotion to general principles of restraint. In the course of time, however, important restrictions upon corporate ambition have disappeared, and until the reaction of last year, we know of no privilege or power which the principal railway com- panies of the state could plausibly demand, either for good or selfish purposes, which had not been unreservedly granted. An abstact of past legislation accompanies this report. It will be seen on reference to the history of this matter, that one act has succeded another, until the statute books have become burdened with the enumeration of powers and privileges made over to the corpora- tions. Many of these corporations never had an existance except in name. Others have long ceased to exist, or have been absorbed by rival corporations. THE LAW OF 1874-ITS MERITS. The so-called &quot;Potter Law&quot; is the result of a rather late awak- ening of the people, especially the producing population, to the im- portant fact, that, while none of the railway companies by whom they were served were over-prosperous, yet some of them had long been indulging in certain acts of unjust partiality, and unreasonable charges which ought to be corrected, and that the constitution of the state afforded them the basis of an adequate legal remedy. The chief merits of the law now in force are these: 1. It is based on the principle of general, rather than specific legislation. Your commissioners have devoted much time to the investigation of the principle of legislation involved, and of the practical results of experience in this particular. We cannot commend that system of legal non-intervention, conspicuously illustrated in the legisla- tion of a portion of the states, so far as it limits public control of corporate power solely to the influences of educated public opinion. But we are nevertheless forced to the conclusion that the equity &apos; &quot;136 Appendix. of the states of Illinois and Wisconsin, and that the foregoing are the articles of such consolidation. W.

WHEELER, Vice President of the Wisconsin and Superior Railroad Company. J. B. Bigelow, Secretary of said Wisconsin and Superior Railroad Com- pany, hereby certifies that the stockholders representing a majority of the capital stock of said company, have consented to the foregoing articles of consolidation.

LA CROSSE AND MILWAUKEE RAILROAD COMPANY AND ST. CROIX AND LAKE SUPERIOR RAILROAD COMPANY. CONTRACT. This indenture made and executed this tenth day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty seven, by and between the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, party of the first part, and the St. Croix and Lake Superior Railroad Company party of the second part, Witnesseth, That the said party of the first part in pursuance of authority granted in the 8th section of an act of the legislature of the state of Wiscon- sin, entitled an act to incorporate the La Cross and Milwaukee Railroad Com- pany, approved April 2, 1852, in the words following to wit: The said com- pany shall have the power to purchase from any other railroad company the whole or any part of any railroad or branch railroad owned by such com- pany, or to lease or to sell to any other company the whole or any part of the railroad, or any of its branches to be built or owned by this company, and also in pursuance of further authority granted in the 1st section of an act of said legislature, approved October 11, 1856, entitled an act to grant certain lands to the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, and to execute the trust created by an act of congress entitled an act granting public lands to the state of Wisconsin to aid in the construction of railroads in said state, approved June 3, 1856 in the words following to wit: The La Crosse and Mil- waukee Railroad Company is hereby authorized and empowered to have, possess, exercise, and enjoy the same right, privileges, functions, franchises authority and immunities with reference to the said routes, or any railroad to be built thereon as it now posseses or enjoys with reference to any route it is now authorized to occupy, or any railroad building or to be built thereon, and there is hereby conferred upon the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company all the power and authority contained in the charter of said com. pany, and in the acts amendatory thereof for the purpose of carying out the objects of this act, and of appropriating and applying the lands hereinafter in this act granted, or their proceeds, to aid in the construction of railroads by this act authorized to be built; and also in pursuance of further authority granted in the 2d section of an act of the said legislature, approved March 5, 1857, entitled an act to amend an act to incorporate the St. Croix and Lake Superior Railroad Company, approved February 24, 1853, in the following words to wit. It shall be lawful for the said company to receive, and for the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company to grant and convey to the said St. Croix &quot; &quot;Gross Earnings of Railways in 1873. 25 No one will assume that the net earnings, as stated, were exces- sively large. The only question to be determined is, whether the sum named and set apart as net earnings, represents the whole amount that should be properly assigned to that account. It appears from the accounts of the company that of the total earnings of the company for 1873, amounting, as above stated, to $9,046,123, the sum of $6,594,560 was paid for operating expenses on a line 1,399 miles in length, while the whole cost of operating the same road the previous year for a line averaging 1,289 miles in length, was but $4, 695,616-the increase of road over 1872 being about 8 1-2 per cent., and the increase in operating expenses over 1872 being about 40 1-2 per cent. It also appears from the report of the General Manager of the company for the year 1873, that the increase in the operating expenses for that &amp;quot;due to the year, was improvement made in the condition of the track during the year, by the purchase and use of 5,834 tons new iron rails and 6,103 tons steel rails; the cost of which, together with the expense of new ties, ballasting, etc., was charged wholly to operating expenses.&amp;quot; Referring to the manager&apos;s statement of operating expenses for 1873, we find that the expenditures for repair of track, bridges, fences, buildings, locomotives, cars, tools and machinery, make the sum of $2,024,495.80; that the expenditures for management and general office, foreign agency and advertising, station service, con- ductors, brakemen, engineers, firemen, wipers, train and station supplies, fuel consumed, oil and waste, personal injuries, damage to property, other loss and damage, legal expenses, New York office, taxes, insurance and miscellaneous purposes make the sum of $2,970,012.50; that the expenditures for stock-yard, Mississippi river ferry, rent of locomotives, rent of cars and expenses of eleva- tors, make the sum of $82,220.41, and that a still further expendi- ture was charged to operating expenses, as follows: For renewal of track For new bridges... For new buildings.. For new tools and machinery Amounting to $1,408,459 93 41,787 48 62,411 89 5,172 32 $1,517,831 C2 Obviously, a portion of this last sum of $1,517,831.62 should have been included in the cost of new construction and in the statement of net earnings. Certainly, the cost of new steel rail, whether laid upon new line, or substituted for old iron rail upon old line, &quot; &quot;138 Report of Railroad Commissioners. 1873 YEAR.

SEPARATE COST AND EARNINGS OF WISCONSIN LINES. Among the duties imposed upon the commissioners, is that of separating cost, receipts, easnings and debt of roads lying partly in and partly out of this state, in such a manner as to determine the proportion in each case belonging to Wisconsin. The commission- ers have partially complied with this injunction of the law. But a full and accurate determination of the facts requires further in- quiry. The difficulties pertaining to such an investigation will be more apparent, when we remind you of the almost inseparable rela- tions existing between the various parts of our principal lines. The property and business of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway extends to five states and one territory. One portion of its road was constructed by the company; another portion was constructed by agents or representative companies in the interest of the gen- eral organization; another portion was acquired by purchase or consolidation, while another portion is operated under lease or other special contract, temporary or permanent. The debt contracted in the construction and acquisition of these various lines is sometimes general and sometimes local, while the receipts and expenditures are so necessarily divided and apportioned as to render the discov- ery of their source and cause in most cases problematical, if not impossible. The difficulties intimated are much enhanced by the fact that no state lines are usually recognized on the books of the company. &quot; &quot;Records of Railway Companies. 133 STATE, CITY And County of New York-SS.

That your petitioner has reason to believe that the several acts, omissions and things as herein alleged and set forth, and divers other particulars and specific violations of the provisions of said chapter 273 and of the laws of the state to remedies to be herein specified and set forth, can be established by proof.

Where the monarch is at once wise, just, and efficient, the affiairs of a company may be admirably managed under such a system. Nevertheless, it is not a safe system. There occur to us two ways in which the state may exercise a conservative power for the improvement of this condition of things: First. By providing that the election of directors shall be upon some well-devised system that will put a check upon the one-man power, giving to bona-fide shareholders some opportunity to ex- ercise a conservative influence upon the management. A very simple method would be to provide that a definite number of shares should be entitled to elect one director. This would insure representa- tion to the minority who aren ow practically ignored. Secondly. By providing for a just representation of the state itself in the board of directors. This method is not without precedent, and it seems to us both important in the interest of the public as well as of stockholders and creditors, and without just objection so far as existing boards of direction are themselves concerned. It is manifest that a state director, watchful of the public inter- ests, would be a conservative element of great value in such a board, although his vote should be but as one to thirteen in the de- termination of such questions as would be decided by them. He would also, in many instances, be of immense service to the honest company by staying public suspicion, and giving to the state a bet- ter understanding of the real condition and wants of the corpora- tion. In the case of all companies having grants of public lands to aid in the construction of their roads, such a representative is still more unquestionably important. Where the state gives lands of its own- —which it does not ordinarily do—there is a manifest pro- priety in its having a voice in their management. And in the case of congressional grants, the state, as trustee of the general govern- ment in the interest of the public improvement of the country, is under the same obligation to see that its agents, the companies, use them in harmony with, and to the best advantage of the trust. &quot; &quot;Remedial Measures. 99 the state, operated by the state under contract, and owned and operated by corporations: NAME OF COUNTRY.

As you appear to have been in correspondence with the Commissioners, what rate do they say I am entitled to for hauling this lumber from Janesville to Monroe? Truly yours, O. E. BRITT. COMMISSIONER HOYT TO J. L. ROOD. J. L. ROOD, Esq., Monroe, Wis. MADISON, OCTOBER 21, 1874. DEAR SIR: Your communication of the 9th addressed to Commissioner Os- born, and enclosing a letter of the 14th from O. E. Britt, General Freight Agent of the Milwaukee &amp;amp; St. Paul Railroad, is at hand. From these letters it appears (1) that you have been considerably overcharged by the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company, for the transportation of lumber from Janes- ville to Monroe; and (2) that such charge has been properly made by authori- ty of Mr. Britt, on the theory that the law allows the St. Paul Co., to com- pute the distance on which their charge shall be based, not from the place where the freight was received by the first company carrying it on its way to the place of consignment, but from the point where they, the said Chicago Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Co., received it. If your lumber was delivered to the C. &amp;amp; N. W. R. R. Co., at Oshkosh to be carried from that place through to Monroe, and was received by said com- pany for continuous transportation from the Junction to the latter place, without objection or stipulation as to delivery at Janesville and transshipment therefrom, then it is unquestionable that the construction put upon the law by Mr. Britt is wholly without warrant, and that, if insisted on, it will neces- sitate legal proceedings in pursuance of the injunction recently granted by the supreme court. With the view to such a contingency, the Railroad Commissioners have laid your case before the Attorney General, and forward herewith the form of an affidavit to be duly executed and returned to them at your earliest con- venience. In concluding your letter of the 19th, you ask, &quot;can the companies refuse to carry other cars than their own on their respective roads?&quot; I know of no law compelling them to haul other cars than their own over any portion of their roads respectively; but if the shipment is made on the above named conditions, there will be little inducement to transship, and if transshipment is made, it cannot be at the expense of the shipper. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, Per H. A. TENNEY, Clerk of the Board. JOHN W. HOYT, Railroad Commissioner. &apos; &quot;&quot; &apos;130 Report of Railroad Commissioners. degree of harmony between the several functional parts of the com- pany itself. If upon these we are to depend for the subsequent minimum of governmental interference, it becomes a proper subject of inquiry: (1) What are the essential requirements? (2) What means are at our disposal to secure them? Evidently, to start with, the requirements are a total revolution in the railroad management of the country. So long as the irregu- larities which notoriously exist through the entire management of these corporations are suffered to continue, so long may we expect that the public will insist upon legislation, the character of which has thus far marked the progress of the railroad agitation, and so long may we expect the theory of state or national ownership to receive serious consideration. The evils which have crept into the management of railroads cannot consistently be expected to be eradicated by enactments which leave the original cause of the trouble intact. The powers which have been granted these corpo- rations, and which have been concentrated in the hands of the offi- cers, and in many cases that of the president alone, have encour- aged wide departures from legitimate business transactions, always at the ultimate expense of the company, and thus, indirectly, that of the public, and in many cases for the mere private emolument of individuals. Foremost in the train of evils which now exist in railroad mat- ters, is that of an entirely deranged and distorted basis. The stockholder, who is the proper owner of the road, is practically im- potent, no interest in the road being attached to his ownership. The funded debt is perhaps largely in excess of the stock itself, and the assumed &quot;cost&quot; represents values which never had a place in the property. STATUTORY LIMITATIONS UPON THE POWER OF DIRECTORS. If the restraints so imposed are to be effectual, they should go no further than will be recognized as reasonable and necessary; a provision of law, for example, prohibiting- (1.) The making a bonded debt until the company shall have first received for stock at least a certain per cent. of the estimated cost, or a certain proportion in the form of securities approved by the state authorities. This would prevent many enterprises from fall- ing into the hands of mere speculative adventurers, and, by fur- &apos; &quot;Railway Statistics. 139 WISCONSIN CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY-Statement of Stock and Debt-from Reports of the Company.

Chap. 272, Laws of 1866, authorizes said company to extend its road from &quot; &quot;70 Report of Railroad Commissioners. instead of a tribunal specially competent to hear and grant relief, in a more summary manner. In 1865 a royal commission was appointed, consisting of the Duke of Devonshire and twelve other distingu shed gentlemen, charged with the duty of considering the subject of railway com- munication, especially the interchange of traffic and the diminution of charges. The report of this commission, presented in 1867, con- tains a vast amount of evidence relating to these and other railway questions, together with their conclusions; the most important of which are in substance as follows: That it is not expedient for the government to avail itself of its reserved right to purchase railways. That parliament should not interfere with the incorporation and financial affairs of railway companies, leaving such matters to be dealt with under the &amp;quot;Joint Stock Companies Act; &amp;quot; limiting its own action to regulating the construction of the line and the relations between the public and the companies so incorporated. That railway companies should be bound to run at least two trains a day for third-class passengers. That it would be &amp;quot;inexpedient, even if it were practicable, to adopt any legislation which would abolish the freedom railway com- panies enjoy of charging what sum they deem expedient within their maximum rates, when properly defined, limited as that freedom is by the Traffic Act.&amp;quot; That railway companies should be required to make stated re- ports to the Board of Trade in such form as the board may pre- scribe. In 1872, another Joint Select Committee on Railway Companies Amalgamations was appointed, consisting of the Marquis of Salisbury, Earl Derby, Earl Cowper, Lord Redesdale, Lord Belper and five eminent members of the House of Commons. The report of this committee deals with the same general questions so often treated of before, and urges with much force the committee&apos;s rea- sons for the following, among other, conclusions: That past amalgamations have not brought with them the evils which were anticipated. That competition between railways exists only to a limited ex- tent, and cannot be maintained by legislation. That combination between railways is increasing, and is likely to increase, whether by amalgamation or otherwise. &quot; &quot;76 Appendix. The Attorney General having established the fact, as we now hold it to be established, we signified our intention to confine the further discussion of this motion to the legal effect of the fact on the question of the right of the state to alter or repeal the charter. Two other points were discussed, how- ever, which we shall briefly notice. It was urged, against the views we had before expressed, that the state stat- utes authorizing the mortgage of the road built under the territorial charter, and authorizing the purchasers on foreclosure to organize anew with the ter- ritorial franchises, operated as a grant from the state of the franchises of the territorial charter. We cannot think so, for the reasons assigned in our form- er opinion. The franchise is quasi property. And by whomsoever held, un- der whatsoever chain of title, is derived from the territorial charter, not from the state statutes. The state statutes did not create it, and do not grant it. They simply authorized the sale and purchase, and the organization by the purchasers of a new corporation, to hold the old franchise under the old grant. The state statutes are merely enabling acts, conferring no franchise, but only authorizing the transfer of the title to existing franchises. It one purchase under a statute, enabling a person otherwise incompetent, to convey, or en- abling a corporation before unauthorized, to convey, he surely does not take his title from the state; he takes his title by authority of the state, but he takes it from his grantor. The title of the Milwaukee and Prairie du Chien Company to the franchise was derived from the territorial charter, though so derived and held by permission of the state. The question turns on the title of the vendor, not on the license given to him to convey; on the title to the thing purchased, not on the license of the purchaser to hold it. The au- thority given to the purchasers to organize a corporation to operate the rail- road, is very similar to authority given to an alien to hold real estate. Both take the authority from the state, but not the title. All these state enabling acts might be repealed without impairing the franchises of the territorial charter, however the appeal might affect the title to them. We have no doubt of this position; and we think that it is fairly recognized in Vilas v. Milway- kee and P. du C. R. R. Co., 17 Wis., 497. It was suggested with much ingenuity that, as the territory was the crea ture of the United States, the state upon its organization succeeded to the the sovereign rights of the United States in the territory, as well those re- served by the United States as those delegated to the territorial government; full sovereignty subject only to the federal constitution. And that, as the or ganic act of congress reserved to that body the right to annul all acts of the territorial legislature, the state succeeded to that right. We cannot think so. Waiving all questions of the sovereign rights of the United States over the territory, the state came into the Union,&amp;quot; on an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatever.&amp;quot; The United States derive their pow- ers from the states, and the states theirs from the United States. And though Wisconsin became a constituent of the United States&apos; as one born out of due time,&apos; it is none the less an equal constituent with the original states. On its establishment, it took no governmental rights or powers from the United States, as a State. As a member of the Union, it took, in common with all the other states, such rights as the federal constitution confers on the original states, as members of the Union. The sovereignty and rights of the sover- eignty of this state came from no organized power. They are inherent in and are derived from its people. The power of congress over territorial leg- islation was an incident to the territorial condition, and lapsed, with the ter ritorial government, when the state came into being. This state, ipso facto, assumed all political authority within its boundaries, not limited or surren- dered by the constitution of the United States. And the source of all legisla tive authority within its bounds must now be found in the state and federal constitutions, and nowhere else. On the argument of the principal motion, it was not suggested at the bar, and it wholly escaped our attention, that a general act concerning corpora- tions in the territorial revision of 1839, reserved to the territorial legislature, power to amend, alter or repeal all subsequent acts of incorporation.

We have been referred by the defendant&apos;s counsel to some authorities holding that acceptaace of a charter applied for, or beneficial to the corpo- ration, may be presumed; and that, in similar cases, slight acts of the corpo- rators looking towards acceptance, are sufficient to establish it. But these authorities relate to charters naming the corporators and delaring them in- corporated, without preliminaay steps, ipso facto, by force of the charter. These rules have no application to charters not naming the corporators and prescribing conditions and formalities by which indeterminate persons may become incorporated. We take the distinction to be correctly stated by Angelland Ames, Sec. 83: &amp;quot;A corporation created by statute, which requires certain acts to be done, to establish its existence; but this rule does not ap- ply to corporations declared such by the act of incorporation.&amp;quot; Such a charter is held to be a contract between the political body granting it, and the corporators under it. The territory of Wisconsin proffered such a contract by the charter in question. So proffered, it remained a mere pro- posal, in fieri, until accepted according to its terms. Who could accept it? Not the commissioners, as we have seen. Only the subscribers. When could they accept it? Only upon subscription of the full amount of capital stock. How could they accept it? By making and filing the statement of subscrip- tion. And the commissioners could do no act, at any time, tending to prove acceptance, because they had no right to accept. And the subscribers could do no act tending to prove acceptance, before the subscription of the whole capital stock; because, until then, they had no right to accept. Such evi- dences of acceptance, as the defendant relies on, must be accompanied by a present right to accept, or they go for nothing. The territorial charter remained a naked, unaccepted proposition, until April 5, 1849, long after the territory had ceased and the state was in existence. The defendant, however, insisted that, be this as it might, the territorial act of March 11, 1848, recognized the corporation as organized; and that there- fore it is not competent for the state now to question its organization prior to the passage of that act. The act of 1848 does prima facie imply such a recognition; but as we said in passing on the former motion, that is not con- clusive. That is a matter on which the legislature might well be misled or misinformed. And, even if the act declared in terms that the corporation had then been organized, we cannot see how such a declaration could prevail over the manifest fact, that the corporation was not organized for upwards of a year after. But the act contains no such declaration. It is entitled an act supplementary to the original charter, and gives new powers to the corpora- tion authorized by the original charter, giving them throughout to the cor- poration so authorized, by its corporate name. Without the fact of the [sub- sequent organization, that seems to imply present organization of the corpor- ation. But the language of the act may well go upon either theory, that the legislature understood that the corporation was not organized, or that it was misled into a belief that it was. The use of the corporate name throughout the act does not necessarily imply that the corporation was already in esse. It is quite consistent with the truth that it was still only in posse. And the fact, now appearing, does away with a different presumption of fact, as we held it would do in our former opinion. › Some cases were cited to show that legislative recognition in a subsequent statute of a corporation de facto, will cure irregularities in its organization and waive forfeitures incurred. People v. Manhattan Co., 9 Wend, 351; Rail- road Co. v. Barnard, 31 Barbour, 258. We do not perceive the application of these cases to aid the view of the defendant. The principle on which they rest appears to us to go the other way. Such recognition has relation to a corporation in esse, waiving irregularity and forfeiture. An act of the legis lature, relating to a corporation, not creating or authorizing one, may well have the effect of condonation, but not of creation. It goes by way of con- firmation or release: and there must be a corporation de facto to be confirmed or to be released. Here there was no corporation de facto to confirm or to release. The inherent trouble of the defendant&apos;s position is that it goes to contradict an admitted fact, and it gives life to a corporation a year or so before it was born. &quot; &apos;Railway Statistics. 101 CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN RAILWAY. ROCK RIVER VALLEY UNION RAILROAD COMPANY. The construction of this road from Fond du Lac via Janesville to the Illi nois state line, a distance of 108 miles, was placed under contract April 30 and August 30, 1851, and work commenced at Fond du Lac in the summer of that year. The contractors, Bradley &amp;amp; Strong, agreed to build the road ready for the rail, including the laying of the rail, but not the price of the iron, from Fond du Lac to Janesville, 86 miles, for $665,000, or about $7,733 per mile; and from Janesville to the state line, about 22 miles, for $306,000, or about $13,900 per mile. For the road from Fond du Lac to Janesville the contract- ors were to be paid one-half in money, and the other either in money or the mortgage bonds of the company at 90 cents on the dollar, at the option of the company. For the road from Janesville to the state line, the contractors were to be paid one-half in money, one-quarter in stock at par, and one-quarter in money, or in bonds of the company at 90 cents on the dollar, at the option of the company. The whole expense of the right of way from Fond du Lac to Janesville was estimated at $10,000, most of the land having been donated by the farmers along the line. Before the close of the year 1851, the president of the company alleged it had received subscriptions of stock to the amount of $1,200,000, on which over $300,000 had been paid in, and its issue of bonds was limited to $1,209,000. The president of the road further declared that this aggregate of stock and bonds ($2,400,000) &quot;all that is needed to build the road.&quot; Nov. 5, 1851, Edwin F. Johnson, Chief Engineer of the company, pub- lished a statement of the estimated cost of the road from Fond du Lac to the Illinois state line, 107.27 miles, as follows: Contract for single-track road bed, embracing everything necessary to render the road complete, ready for operation, excepting right of way, fencing, iron rails, chairs, spikes and buildings, $971,000; 1,100 tons iron rails, at $55.00, $605,000; chairs and spikes, $48,000; right of way and fencing, $100,000; engineering, general ex- penses and interest account, $100,000. Total cost, $1,824,000—nearly $17,000 per mile. Mr. Johnson added: &quot;From the Illinois state line to Chicago, the distance is about 75 miles, and 12 miles further to the Indiana state line; making in all in the state of Illinois, 87 miles, nearly. The surveys upon this portion are yet incomplete. Enough, however, is known to justify the opinion, that this portion will not exceed in cost per mile the part in Wiscon- sin, and that the curves and gradients will be equally favorable. I feel confi- dent that the entire cost of a single track railroad, with the requisite turns- out, from Fond du Lac to Chicago, 182 miles, laid with T rail, weighing from 54 to 60 pounds per lineal yard, will not exceed $3,000,000 or $3,200,000. This amount is exclusive of what may be required for station houses, depot build- ings and equipments, or rolling stock. If the latter be included, the average cost may amount to $20,000 per mile; or, for the entire line, from Fond du Lac to Chicago, $3,600,000.&quot; &apos; &quot;Laws Relating to Railroads. 289 Laws relating to the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad, and the Roads merged in and absorbed by it.

On sworn proof that said stock had been subscribed for in good faith, and five per cent. ac- tually paid in, the commissioners were declared a body corporate and politic, with perpetual succession, and vested with all the privileges, franchises and immunities incident to a corporation. They were required to give thirty days notice, by publication, of the time and place of meeting for the pur. pose of electing nine directors, and the meetings for this purpose were re- quired to be held on the first Monday of July in each year. The affairs of the corporation were to be managed by the board of directors, to be chosen annually by ballot, by votes of the stockholders. The board was authorized, to appoint one of their own number as president, and the term of office was fixed at one year. They were also authorized to appoint a secretary, treas- urer, engineers, and such other officers as were necessary. At each annual meeting a complete statement of the company&apos;s affairs was required to be exhibited for the year preceding.

The price of railway stock and bonds in any market depends less upon the rate of interest prom- ised than upon the character of the enterprises upon which they are based. Most of all, they depend upon the legitimate management of the property in which the purchase money is invested. The history of all railway management furnishes an instructive les- son upon this topic. It is an almost unbroken history of broken faith and depreciated credit. Stocks originally sold under sanguine as- surances of large returns, have become worthless paper. Bonds doubly assured on their face and by every apparent source of securi- ty, in many cases possess but a speculative and uncertain value. Tables appended to this report furnish but an inadequate impression of the fluctuating and unreliable character of the assurances and re- wards furnished capital for investment in the railways of our own state. Original sources of capital.-In the beginning, a very large pro- portion of the credit and capital necessary to the construction of Wisconsin railroads was furnished by citizens and municipal corpo- rations of the state. This at a time, too, when the state was thinly populated and its people comparatively poor. And originally the profits of railway investment were far more promising than now. The cost of construction was absolutely less, and the operating ex- penses very much less in proportion to gross receipts. Insecurity of railway investments.-At the present time, how- ever, popular confidence in railway stocks has practically departed. No farmer, no merchant, no retired capitalist seeks to invest his surplus funds or labor in any railway company in which he does not himself possess control. And this want of confidence and re- fusal to contribute to public enterprises of this class, are in no manner measured by the real merits of the enterprise itself. On the contrary, they are the fruit of the common judgment, that rail- way capital is the sport of speculative management. Depreciation of bonded security.-Nor does this want of confi- dence extend to stock subscriptions alone. The bonded debts of railway companies are also rapidly becoming the object of sus- picion. And this on precisely the same ground that originally de- teriorated the market value of capital stock. The stock is no longer &quot; &apos;98 Report of Railroad Commissioners. solidated mortgage upon the entire property and franchises of the company, to secure the payment of bonds to the amount of $35,000,000. Of these, $26,225,000 were set apart to exchange for an equal amount of bonds pre- viously issued and secured on different divisions of the road, and the re- mainder were to be used only &quot;for the purchase of steel rails, the erection and completion of bridges across the Mississippi river, the erection of grain elevators at Chicago and Milwaukee, and the further equipment and perma- nent improvement of the mortgaged property.&quot; Also in March, 1874, the di- rectors declared a dividend of seven per cent. on the preferred stock, from the earnings of 1873, and the same was paid from the new issue of consoli- dated bonds, in place of net earnings of 1873, used for the purchase of new steel rails and other improvements of the road. RACINE, JANESVILLE AND MISSISSIPPI RAILROAD COMPANY (NOW THE WESTERN UNION.) The original line proposed extended from Racine to Janesville. Before proceeding to the construction of the road the route was changed to the present line of the Western Union road. The construction of the entire line from Racine to Beloit was first contracted April 1, 1853, and the work was vigorously prosecuted until the death of the contractor in the following month of August. January 2, 1854, another contract was made for the grading, bridging and masonry between Burlington and Beloit, about 42 miles. The work on this contract amounted to about $220,000, $95,000 of which was payable in the bonds of the town of Beloit at 95 cents on the dollar, and the balance in cash. A separate contract was made for ties. Depot grounds were secured in Ra- cine and Beloit, the former including 15 acres of land and 3,000 feet of river front. The directors estimated the total cost of the road, fully furnished and equipped in all departments, at $1,340,000, or $20,000 per mile for the 67 miles from Racine to Beloit. To meet this cost the following resources were relied upon: Stock subscription, $619,100; stock towards construction, $50,900; first mortgage bonds, $670,000. Total resources, $1,340.000. The capital stock consisted of the following items: Racine city bonds, $300,000; Beloit bonds, $100,000: Delavan bonds, $25,000; Racine town bonds, $50,000; private subscriptions in Racine, $93,000; ditto in Beloit and on line, $51,100. Total stock, $619,100. In January, 1854, about $60,000 of Racine city bonds, and all the bonds of Beloit and Delavan had been negotiated, and over $37,500 had been paid on personal subscriptions. The details of estimated cost from Racine to Beloit, by the engineer, were as follows: Grading, ma- sonry and bridging, $342,036; 6,233½ gross tons of rail on track, at $7,800 $486,216.90; chairs and spikes, $600 per mile, $39,648; ties, $58,113.75; laying track and dressing up, $400 per mile, $26,432; ballasting and raising track, $86,710; 3½ miles of turn-outs, $37,710; eight locomotives, $72,000; eight &apos; &apos;10 Report of Railroad Commissioners. The charter of this company was passed by the legislature during the ses- sion of 1863; was approved and became a law of the state, April 1, 1863. This charter, among the numerous powers and privileges granted therein, provides in section seven (7), that: &quot;The directors shall have power to pre- scribe a tariff of prices for the transportation of freight and passengers, and to alter or change the same; or, in their discretion to empower the superin- tendent or other agents to prescribe or alter such tariffs.” Relying fully upon the assurance given by the state, as contained in the par- agraph quoted, this company proceeded to construct its present line and to negotiate for the money required for the purpose. This assurance or pledge upon the part of the state, furnished the basis upon which the company was enabled to successfully prosecute such negotiations, and upon which its bonds were taken by the first or original holders. Had the good faith and honesty of the state, in giving the assurance, been for a moment questioned, it is needless to say that the bonds could never have been sold, consequently the road that has so largely contributed to the development of the natural re- sources of Northwestern Wisconsin, would never have been constructed. Upon the question as to the legal right of the state to break its faith, so sol- emnly pledged and to withdraw, after the investments were made and the work completed, the assurance it so voluntarily proclaimed as an inducement to se- cure the building of a much needed outlet for the products of this territory, I have no desire now to enter, but wish simply to present to your honorable board certain premises, from which you may readily conclude that the exercise of such a right (assuming it to exist), as applied to this company, would be an act of the grossest injustice and productive of irretrievable disaster, not alone to the innocent holders of its securities (whom it would defraud), but to the agricultural and industrial interests of the state so largely dependent upon the operation of the road for their present and future prosperity. The manage- ment disposed of an amount of bonds barely sufficient to meet the original cost of construction; since which it has always been the aim of the company to make such reasonable rates for passenger and freight traffic as would en- able them to satisfy the interest maturing semi-annually on these bonds held by investors in Europe and America; and I am free to say that only by the most rigid economy in the operating of the road and conduct of its business, has it ever been able to realize net earnings sufficient to promptly meet these legitimate and important obligations. The stockholders having great confidence in the future welfare of the state, as a result of her valuable systems of railways, being content to await a growth of traffic and consequent increase of net revenue, before realizing any returns from their investments. This line as you are undoubtedly aware, runs through a new country, sparcely settled, with a corresponding scarcity of business, and will not in the near future, prove at all profitable to any company who would assume to operate it. By way of explanation I will say, that a road cannot be considered as being profitably operated, that eannot earn sufficient money above running expenses, to pay the interest on its bonded indebtedness, a fair interest upon &apos; &quot;Railway Statistics. 261 Legal and Railroad Passenger Rates-continued.

December 31, 1854, about seven miles were graded, ready for ties and iron. The engineer estimated that the entire cost of completed road from Horicon to Berlin-42 miles- with equipment, under contracts made, would reach $794,800, or less than $19,000 per mile, as follows: Contract for road-bed, $226,800; iron rails, $252,000; buildings, $30,000; equipment, $100,000; chairs, spikes, frogs and switches, $16,000; right of way and fencing, $50,000; side track, two miles, $20,000; contingent expenses, $100,000. This estimate was made under the order of the directors to make the estimate high enough to cover cost in any contingency. Waupun had voted to exchange bonds with the company to the amount of $50,000, and Berlin to the amount of $100,000, and depot grounds had been secured at Horicon, Waupun, Ripon and Perlin, without cost to the company. The resources of the company were: Stock sub- scribed, $305,900; mortgage stock, $160,000; stock to contractors, $55,100; Berlin and Waupun bonds, $150,000; first mortgage bonds, $420,000; county and town bonds, to be voted, $270,000. Total resources, $1,361,000. Total amount expended to December 31, 1854, $31,094.35. RIVER DIVISION. This road was chartered May 22, 1857, under the corporate name of &quot;Min. nesota and Pacific Railroad Company.&quot; Subsequently it became the &quot;St. Paul and Chicago Railroad Company.&quot; It runs from La Crescent, opposite La Crosse, to St. Paul-a distance of about 128 miles. Work first commenced on this line in September, 1865; a portion of the road was opened for traffic in December, 1869, and the whole line was completed for business in 1872. In Aug., 1873, the road possessed seven water stations, one iron bridge 600 feet long, and 41 wooden bridges and trestles (aggregate length 8.118 feet). The rolling stock consisted of ten locomotives of an average weight of 60,000 lbs., one snow-plow, twelve first and second class passenger cars, four sleeping cars, ten mail, express and baggage cars, and 250 freight cars. The funded debt was $4,000,000 in 7 per cent bonds. This road was bought by the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, January 1, 1872, all its rolling stock, equipment, appurtenances and franchises included. The price paid was $3,000,000 in the bonds of the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company, secured by a mortgage on the road from La Crescent to St, Paul, and $1,000,000 in addition were issued on the completion of the road to La Crescent, which sum of $4,000,000 is the total purchase price of the road-$31,250 per mile. (See appendix B.) The gross earnings for the year ending August 31, 1873, were $632,765.80, and the net earnings, $248,617.18. Amount paid for interest the same year was 290,033.32. Gross earnings per mile, $4,943.48. Operating expenses per mile, $3,000.14. Net earnings per mile, $1,942.39.

HASTINGS AND DAKOTA DIVISIONS. This road was originally chartered February 20, 1857. Its original cor- porate name was the &quot;Hastings, Minnesota River and Red River Railroad Company.&quot; The name was subsequently changed to &quot; Hastings and Dakota Railroad Company.&quot; The line now extends from Hastings to Glencoe, a dis- tance of 74 miles. The work of construction commenced in May, 1868. It was first opened for traffic in 1871, and was completed to Glencoe in August, 1872. The following is an inventory of property for the year ending August 31, 1873: engine houses, 3; water stations, 6; wooden bridges (aggregate length, 427 feet), 2; other trestle work (aggregate length, 3,430 feet), 39. Rolling stock—locomotives (average weight, 40,000 lbs.), 3; snow plows, 1; first and second class passenger cars, 4; mail, express and baggage cars, 2; freight cars estimated, 75. The capital stock issued in 1873 was $750,000. The funded debt, $1,350,000. The road was sold to the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company, July 1, 1872, which paid for the same $1,350,000 in bonds secured on the road, and $750,000 in the common stock of the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company, making a total of $2,000,000 for the purchase price of the road, a rate of about $27,000 per mile. The gross earnings of the road for the year ending August 31, 1873, were $55,736.46, or $743.15 per mile, while the operating expenses for the year were $80,770.95, or $1,076.95 per mile. This road was sold to the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company June 29, 1872, on the terms above specified, the sale including the following rolling stock: &quot;five new locomotives, first class; seventy-five new box freight cars, and four new passenger cars.&quot; (See appendix, p. 118.) MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL. The Milwaukee and St. Paul Company was organized by articles of asso- ciation filed with the Secretary of state May 5, 1863. The company pur- chased the &quot;Milwaukee and Western&quot; Railroad at public sale under a de- cree of the United States district court, in Milwaukee, June, 1863. The Milwaukee and St. Paul company also purchased the &quot;Milwau- kee and Horicon&quot; Railroad at public sale, under a decree of the United States district court, at Milwaukee, June 12, 1863. The road was bid in by Russell Sage and Washington Hunt for $670,000. On the same day—June 12, 1863-the western division of the La Crosse and Milwaukee Road was deliv- ered into the possession of the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company, under a decree of the United States district court in a foreclosure suit instituted by the owners of the land grant mortgage, on that portion of the La Crosse and Milwaukee road between Portage City and La Crosse.

We shall, therefore, simply present the salient points in the history of such action; giving as correctly as we can the present status of those few states which either have been or are now espe- cially active in their efforts to protect the people against what is deemed railway oppression. 1. The problem in New York. Ere the twentieth year of railway experience in New York, the evils of mismanagement on the part of railroad companies had be- come so important as to demand legislative action, and finally the appointment, in 1855, of a board of railroad commissioners, charged with duties similar to those imposed upon the commissioners of this state. The report made by this first board of commissioners is one of much interest. Even thus early most, perhaps all, the evils of which complaint is now made, had crept into the business of con- structing and building railroads. The same spirit of speculation, building in advance of due preparation, and managing in the in- terest of corporators instead of the corporation and the public, was rife, as will appear from the following quotations from that re- port: * * * * * &quot;In many cases, those who desire the benefits of a railroad furnish too small a portion of its cost to insure a proper watchfulness in the expendi- tures. As so much of the money is obtained by borrowing, it is likely to be carelessly expended or squandered.&quot; “In the natural anxiety to secure the work, estimates are presented, under- rating the cost and over-rating the prospective profits. These under-estimates require an earlier resort to loans, and the first bonds being exhausted before the completion of the work, the issue of a second becomes necessary, while the equipment is either left wholly or in part to be obtained by a floating debt, pledge of income, or some other financial chicanery. * * * Such a process sinks the value of the stock to its lowest ebb, and the con- tinued drains for the payment of heavy interest, keeps it there beyond the hope of recovery.&quot; Touching the management of the roads themselves, the New York commissioners say: &quot;To the errors made in the first construction of some roads is added a con- stant increase of the capital from year to year, until the point is reached where the profits of even a large business are insufficient to meet the interest &apos; &quot;Official Papers and Correspon dence. 61 * * * * * &amp;quot;From the wording of the last clause of section 5 of chap- ter 273, to wit: &apos;In computing the rates for carrying any freight, according to the provisions of this act, the distance for carrying such freight shall be computed from where it is received, notwithstanding it may pass from one road to another,&apos; it would seem to be inferred that, should a company elect to receive freight for forwarding to points beyond its corporate jurisdiction, that it would do so with the understanding that it assumed the responsibility of adjusting compensation with its connecting companies, equally with that for the delivery of the goods. The law provides for the manner of comput. ing distance when freight passes over more than one road, and inferentially, also, for carrying at the maximum charges for the whole distance.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The law seems to make provision for each road separately, leaving the adjustment of compensation as heretofore existing between connecting com- panies to themselves, defining only the conditions between each separate road and the people, and fixing the limitation of charges.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We are led to the conclusion that although no part of the law provides directly that the companies shall pro-rate with one another, yet it would seem that an absolute necessity for adjustment between them would arise both as to compensation for carriage as well as equipment, or else they would be constrained to refuse freights for destinations beyond the limits of their own lines and stations.&amp;quot; You will notice from the above that the commissioners do not assume that the roads should, or should not, pr-orate between themselves; the cammissioner understanding that the proportionate adjustment of rates between connecting roads is entirely within the roads themselves; the law only designing that when a company accepts freight for a destination beyond its corporate jurisdiction, the rates charged shall be ascertained by compu- tation for the whole distance from where it is received to its destination, notwithstanding it may pass from one railroad to another.&amp;quot; 66 Hence the commissioners would not desire to have the circular you pro- pose to issue, and which will amount to a specific mode of dividing compensation between connecting roads, to be understood as their interpreta- tion of law. Very respectfully yours, J. H. OSBORN, Railroad Commissioner. ATT&apos;Y GEN. SLOAN TO SOLICITOR B. C. COOK. B. C. Cook, Esq., Solicitor C. &amp;amp; N. W. R. R.: MADISON, Nov. 10, 1874. DEAR SIR: Complaint is made that your company is charging for trans- porting lumber by the car-load, received from the West Wisconsin Railroad and carried over your road, higher rates than allowed by the &amp;quot;Potter Law.&amp;quot; That you charge in such cases $8 per car for the first 25 miles carried over your road, treating it as originally shipped on your road, and making no al- lowance for the fact that the lumber had come to you from the West Wiscon- sin Railroad. I think this a violation of chapter 273, Laws of 1874, which provides that the distance for carrying freight shall be computed from where it is received, notwithstanding it may pass from one railroad to another. If this complaint is well founded, we shall be compelled to take proceed- ings against the officers of your company for a violation of the injunction. I deem it proper to inform you of this complaint, in the hope that you may &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 115 LA CROSSE AND MILWAUKEE RAILROAD-Statement of Cost-from the Reports of the Company.

Co., your attention is particularly directed to tariff of the Railroad Commissioners of the said State, dated Mad- ison May 14, 1874, in which is the following: &amp;quot;In all cases distances are to be computed from localities where freight is received, notwithstanding it may pass from one railroad to another.&amp;quot; 66 You will hereafter way-bill freight from your station to the junction point with such roads as are included in classes A&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;B&amp;quot; at the strict mile- age pro rate of the roads, as allowed by the commissioners&apos; table and which is the same as our tariff of October 1st, for the whole distance, noting in the body of the way-bill the total miles from station of shipment to station of des- tination, and showing the number of miles to be transported by this company, and the number of miles by connecting railroads. Station agents at junction points will show this circular to the agents of connecting roads, and ask them to deliver to them expense bills for freight consigned to our road, with similar information entered thereon, and agents of this company must not receive any such freight destined for our road, from any connecting roads unless the charges are first corrected to their pro rata proportion of the whole charge for carriage from point of shipment to point of destination, when both are within the state of Wisconsin.

Your information that the commissioners or courts had decided that com- pensation for through carriage of freight should be pro rated is not correct, and is probably based upon the contents of a letter from this board to W.

THE CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL RAILWAY. In Quo Warranto. To the Supreme Court of Wisconsin- The Attorney General of the state of Wisconsin respectfully shows, that the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company is a corporation, other than municipal, duly created and organized by the laws of the state of Wisconsin, that the said company, on the first day of January, 1874, owned and operated about six hundred miles of railroad within the said state of Wisconsin, and ever since that time has used, managed and operated the same in the transportation of freight and passengers upon its railroad. And your petitioner further shows, that the legislature of the state of Wis- consin, at its annual session in the year 1874, duly passed an act entitled &quot; an act relating to railroads, express and telegraph companies in the state of Wis- consin,&quot; approved March 11, 1874, and being chapter 273 of the laws of said year 1874; that said act was duly published on the 28th day of April, 1874, and took effect on that day. That in and by the provisions of said act, among other things, all the rail- roads of the state were divided into classes; all freight thereafter transported upon said railroads, or any part thereof, were classified, and the compensa- tion to be charged and received by said railroads for the transportation of freights and passengers over their respective roads fixed and limited as there- in prescribed. And your petitioner further shows upon information and belief that the classification of said railroads and freights, and the rates of compensation for the transportation of freight and passengers upon said roads, as fixed and established by said chapter 273, are just and reasonable and within the proper exercise of the legislative power. And your petitioner further shows that the said Chicago Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company on the 29th day of April, 1874, filed in the office of the Governor of the state of Wisconsin, a communication in writing signed by Alexander Mitchell its president, in which among other things it an- nounced its purpose to disregard the provisions of said chapter 273, so far as the same attempts arbitrarily to fix rates of compensation for freights and passengers, and to manage and operate its railroads within the state of Wis- consin without regard to its requirements. And your petitioner further shows that the said Chicago Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company on or about the 6th day of May, 1874, adopted and issued a tariff for rates for freights between local stations within the state, to take effect on the 8th day of May, 1874, and have also adopted and established a tariff for rates for freight and passengers transported over their roads within said state of Wisconsin, and a classification of freights, all of which are in disregard of the rates and clasifications fixed by said chapter 273, and contrary to the requirements of said chapter that the said Railroad Company have also issued to their agents and servants instructions to charge demand and receive of all persons passing over their road, or shipping &apos; &quot;234 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

Gen&apos;l Land Office.&amp;quot; Chap. 89 of the P. and L. Laws of 1872, approved March 22, 1872, repeals the grant conferred by chap., 175 of G. L. of 1865 upon the St. Croix and Lake Superior Railroad, to lands acquired by the state through the acts of congress of June 3, 1856 and May 5, 1864. * * * provided, Nothing in the act shall be construed to impair the rights of the Wisconsin R. R. Farm Mortgage Co. to the grant of land made by congress to the state of Wisconsin, June 3, 1856. By sec. 1, chap. 98, P. and L. Laws of 1872, approved March 23, 1872. The &amp;quot;Wisconsin Railroad Farm Mortgage Land Company&amp;quot; was declared to be the legal successor (as to the rights acquired and conferred in, and to a portion of the lands granted by congress to the state of Wisconsin by an act approved June 3, 1856) of the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, as fixed and reserved in and by the contract entered into by and between the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, and the St. Croix and Lake Superior Rail- road Company, which contract was executed by the said companies, on the 10th day of March 1857, and was as required by law, filed and recorded in the office of the Secretary of State, on the 19th day of November, 1857. (Page 298.) The portion of the contract referred to, reads thus: &amp;quot;But it is hereby expressly understood between the parties hereto, that the said La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company possesses, and does not surrender or release the right of selecting any lands within fifteen miles of, and more than six miles from the route of the said road or roads between the St. Croix river or lake and the west end of Lake Superior, and also between said route and Bayfield, for the purpose of making up any deficiency which &quot; &quot;Executive and Legal Documents. 17 States, which prohibits the passage of any law impairing the obligation of contracts. The views already expressed apply somewhat to this objection, but the direct and obvious answer is that the creditor contracts with the corpora- tion precisely as the corporation contracts with the state, and both must take notice of, and are bound by the conditions and reservations in the charter. The courts will read the contract with the creditor, as if the legislative conditions were printed therein in full. The charter is granted by the state and accepted by the corporation, and the creditor contracts with it subject to the power of the grantor to alter or impair the obligation. No right can vest, for it is agreed by both the grantee and the creditor that none shall vest. The creditor makes his investment cum onere, and cannot complain that the alteration of the charter impairs his obligation, because by its terms it admits of the very alteration imposed. It may be folly for the creditor to invest, in view of this possible interference, but he assents to the terms and takes the risk of just such interference. The creditor gains no right which the company did not possess, and the state surrenders none of the power it had reserved. A mortgagee stands in no different relation in this respect, than any other creditor. The extent of the mortgage lien is to be measured by the interest of the mortgagor in the property to which the lien attaches, and the courts will not by construction so enlarge the lien as to relive it from the burdens or restrictions to which it is subject, much less will they give to the mortgage such sancity and force as to repeal a fundamental law of the state, or essentially change its meaning and intent. The examination of these questions and the principles governing them might be further extended, but it seems hardly necessary. The conclusion reached is that said chapter 273 is not obnoxious to any of the objections urged against it, but is a constitutional enactment, and as such entitled to obedience. A. SCOTT SLOAN. Attorney General. APPLICATION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE STATE OF WISCONSIN VS. THE CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN RAIL- WAY CO., In Quo Warranto. To the Supreme Court of the state of Wisconsin. The Attorney General of the state of Wisconsin respectfully shows that the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company is a corporation other than municipal, duly created and organized by the laws of the state of Wisconsin, that the said company on the first day of January 1874, owned and operated about five hundred and sixty six miles of railroad within the said state of Wisconsin, and ever since that time has used, managed and operated the same in the transportation of freight and passengers upon its said railroad. And your petitioner further shows, that the legislature of the state of Wis- consin at its annual session in the year 1874, duly passed an act entitled an act relating to Railroads, express and telegraph companies in the state of Wisconsin, approved March 11, 1874, and being chapter 273 of the laws of said year 1874, that said act was duly published on the 28th day of April 1874, and took effect on that day. That in and by the provisions of said act among other things all the rail. roads of the state, were divided into casses; all freights thereafter transported upon said railroads or any part thereof were classified, and the compensation 2-R.

The law imposes duties impossible of accomplishment. Under the old law of Wisconsin, not yet repealed, railroad com- panies are required to report to stockholders, in February, a state- ment of affairs for the year ending on the 31st day of December of the previous year, and a copy of this statement is required to be filed with the Secretary of State. Under the law of last year, the Railroad Commissioners are required to report, in January, a far more complete statement of railway affairs for the year ending on the 31st day of the preceding month. The incongruity and im- practicability of the duty thus imposed upon the commissioners, admits of no explanation more charitable than that of undue haste and misapprehension in the enactment of the law. 7. The law inadequately provides for enforcement. Experience has shown this to be a weak point-one responsible for much useless trouble to the public concerned, and entailing heavy aggregate expenses upon both people and companies. Trust- ing to this element of weakness in the law, the leading railway com- panies were at first regardless of its provisions; and it is safe to say that, but for the unusual course finally resorted to by the executive, the law would have been practically a useless instrument in the hands of the people. It is now manifest, both from experience, and from the nature of the conditions, that any law seeking the ends proposed by the &amp;quot;Potter law&amp;quot; should not only be enforced by the state, and at the expense of the state, but that it should make adequate provision for en- forcement through the agency of some branch of the state govern- ment duly authorized and reqnired to commence prosecutions when- ever the public interests require it. The deficiencies of the law, as seen from the commissioners&apos; present point of view, will appear from the discussions under the head of remedial measures. REMEDIAL MEASURES The conditions which are to characterize the relative position of railroads and governments, seem already to be indicated. While experience everywhere has demonstrated the necessity of interpos- ing public authority to protect the interests of the public, the char- 7-R. R. &quot; &apos;Executive and Legal Documents. 63 1 alter or repeal the charter granted to the Sheboygan and Fond du Lac Rail- road Company, is certain. This is a power reserved by the constitution. The railroad can, therefore, be controlled and regulated by the state. Its use can be defined; its tolls and rates for transportation may be limited.&quot; It was argued for the defendants that the power is a limited one. It is so said in Miller v. State and Holyoke v. Lyman, supra; and in some Massachu. setts cases, that it must be reasonably exercised. But the remarks in the for- mer cases seem to relate to the property, rather than to the franchise, and are vague. And it seems to us that the legislature is the sole judge of the rea sonable nature of the original charter. And so that court itself says in effect in Mayor v. Norwich &amp;amp; W. R. R. Co., supra. But these dicta are too vague and general for either guidance or authority. The reserved power in our constitution is a positive provision entering into all charters under it, and must be construed as it is written. We cannot con- strue away its meaning, or hold it to mean something else, which we or oth- ers might consider wiser or better. We are bound, in our construction of it, by the very words used. We refer to a large number of cases on this point of construction, collated by Dixon, C. J., in 26 Wis., 451. The power is lim. ited by its own words only. Any limitation of it must come from those words. And we must be guided in our construction of the words used, if the words will admit of it, by the purpose of the provision, to do away in this state the rule in the Dartmouth College case, so far as it relates to charters of private corporations. The power to repeal can bear but one construction; for, in this use, the word has but one meaning. The power to alter depends on the meaning of the word, alter. To alter is to make different, without de- stroying identity, (Crabb ;) to vary without entire change, Webster and Imp. Dict.) A corporate charter of one kind, cannot be altered to a charter of an entirely different kind. But a corporate charter may be altered so as to make it different in detail, so long as the general identity of the corporation remains; so that it is varied, without entire change. This is the obvious meaning to lawyer or layman. Arguments ab inconvenienti cannot weigh gainst the manifest meaning of the word used; they may go to impeach the wisdom of the power, but not to impair its import. We think that Mr. Justice Paine recognized the true limit, depending on the word used, in Kenosha R. R. Co. v. Marsh, supra: &quot;I suppose it would hardly be claimed that the state, even where this power of amendment is re- served, could, by amending the charter of a railroad company so as to pro- vide for a new and entirely different road, impose any obligation on the cora- portion to build it.&quot; That is a particular application of the rule, not to alter so as entirely to change. But it is unnecessary to pursue this topic further, as there can be no doubt that there is as unquestionable an exercise of the power to alter as can well be. The charters of the defendants gave them an unlimited right to toll. The alteration limits the right. This is strict alteration, or there is no such thing as alteration. This is just what Strong, J., says in Olcott v. Supervisors, supra, and Dixon, C. J., says in Whiting v. Sheboygan R. R. Co., supra, the legislature can do under the power to alter. We shall not discuss the question whether the defendants have a right to take toll, as intimated by Mr. Justice Strong in the state freight tax case, 15 Wallace, 232, without any franchise to take it, as an attribute of ownership. They certainly could not have a right to exact what they might please. But the question is not here, because these corporations accepted a franchise to take toll, and must be held to take it under the franchise. And we need hardly notice the point made, that, the franchise to take toll without limitation, once granted, inheres in the railroad as property, beyond the reach of the reserved power to alter. Logically considered, this is only a denial, in another form, of the reserved power to alter. If the franchise inhere in the property by the use of it, and be revocable, then it would be severed from the property by repeal; and, upon alteration, would in here,jonly, as altered. A building is real estate, by being attached to the soil; but if it be taken down, the brick and wood do not still inhear in the land. The re severved power would be nugatory, if the mere use of the franchise could operate to put it beyond alteration or repeal. The position is a mere petitio principii. &apos; &quot;118 Report of Railroad Commissioners. FOX LAKE RAILROAD-Statement of Stock and Debt-From Reports of the Company. STOCK AND DEBT. YEAR.

Subject to this reserved right, and under the rule in the Dartmouth College case, charters of private corporations are contracts, but contracts which the state may alter or determine at pleasure. Contracts of that character are not unknown in ordinary private dealings; and such we hold to be the sound and safe rule of public policy. It is so in England. It is so under the Federal government itself. The material property and rights of corporations should be inviolate, as they are here; but it comports with the dignity and safety of the state that the franchises of corporations should be subject to the power which grants them, that corporations should exist as the subordinates of the state, which is their creator, durante bene placito. This is a question of state law, not of federal law. We give full scope to the federal constitution, as interpreted by the federal courts, but we stand clearly outside of both. This question could be brought within the Dart- mouth College rule, not by interpretation of the federal constitution, but by interpretation of the state constitution only. That is our function. We ac- cept the construction of the federal constitution as the federal courts give it- But we give construction to our own constitution for ourselves. And there we might well rest. But the exercise of this reserved power has been sanctioned by the federal and other state courts. The general banking law of New York, of 1838, provided that stockhold- ers of banks under it should not be personally liable for the debts of their banks, unless they should expressly so declare by their articles of associa- tion; but the law reserved power to the legislature to alter or repeal it at any time-the very words of our constitution. Under this law, a bank was or- ganized in 1844, and the stockholders declared, by their articles of associa tion, that they should not be liable for the debts of the banks. Afterwards, the constitution of the state, of 1846, declared the stockholders liable, and the legislature of 1849 passed an act to enforce that liability. The courts of New York held the stockholders liable; and the supreme court of the United States affirmed the judgment, holding that the constitutional provision and act of 1849 impaired the obligation of no contract, either in the general banking law or in the articles of association, because the reserved power subjected the contract and the stockholders to the change made in their liability. Sher- man v. Smith, 1 Black, 587. See also 21 N. Y., infra. In the Pennsylvania College Case, 13 Wallace, 190, the opinion of the court states that &amp;quot;Cases often arise where the legislature, in granting an act of in- corporation for a private purpose, either makes the duration of the charters conditional, or reserve to the state the power to alter, modify or repeal the same at pleasure. Where such a provision is incorporated in the charter, it is clear that it qualifies the grant, and that the subsequent exercise of that reserved power cannot be regarded as an act within the prohibition of the constitution. Such a power also, that is, the power to alter, modify or re- peal an act of incorporation,-is frequently reserved to the state by a general law applicable to all acts of incorporation, or to certain classes of the same, as the case may be, in which case it is equally clear that the power may be exercised, whenever it appears that the act of incorporation is one which falls within the reservation, and the charter was granted subsequent to the passage of the general law, even though the charter contains no such condi- tion nor any allusion to such a reservation. Reservations, in such a charter, it is admitted, may be made; and it is also conceded that, when they exist, the exercise of the power reserved, by a subsequent legislature, does not im. pair the obligation of the contract created by the original act.&amp;quot; The same point is ruled in many cases, amongst others, in Miller v State, 15 Wallace, 478; Tomlinson v. Jessup, 15 Wallace, 454; Holyoke Co. v. Lyman, 15 Wallace, 500; McLaren v. Pennington, 1 Paige, 102; Re Oliver Lee&apos;s Bank, 21 N. Y., 9; Perrin v. Oliver, 1 Minn., 202; Mayor, etc. v. Norwich &amp;amp; W. R. R. Co., 109 Mass., 103; Parker v. Metropolitan R. Ř. Co., 109 Mass., 506; Stephens v. Smith, 29 Vermont, 160. In Olcutt v. Supervisors, 16 Wallace, 678, a case from this state, turning on the relations of a railroad company and the state, the court takes occasion to say of the reserved power in our constitution: &amp;quot;That the legislature may &quot; &quot;32 Appendix. court to understand, and alleges, that in and by the provisions of the said last named act, it is among other things enacted, that all the railroads of the said state be and aredivided into classes, and that all the freights to be transported upon said railroads or any parts thereof, within the state of Wisconsin, after the passage of the said last mentioned act, be and are classified, and the com- pensation to be charged and received by the companies owning, managing and operating said railroads, were fixed and limited as therein prescribed. And the said Attorney General further, as aforesaid, shows and informs the court that the said defendant, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, instead, as he had well hoped and believed it would do, of con- firming the use, operation and management of its said railroad within the limits and conditions, and according to the regulations and prescriptions of the last aforesaid act, and without attempting to exceed the powers granted to and conferred upon it by law, and particularly without attempting to dis- regard the provisions and requirements of the act last aforesaid, in the trans- action of its said business, and in the operation of its said road, did, imme- diately after the said act took effect, to wit: on the 29th day of April, A. D. 1874, file in the office of the Governor of the state of Wisconsin, a communi- cation in writing, signed by Alexander Mitchell, its president, in which, among other things, it announced its intention to disregard the provisions and requiremenis of the said last named act, being chapter 273 of the laws of 1874, so far as it provides and fixes the rates of compensation for the trans- portation of passengers and freights within said state, and to manage and operate its railroads to and from and between its various stations within said state, regardless of the requirements of said act of the legislature, and in de- fiance of law. And the said Attorney General further, as aforesaid, avers, and gives the court to understand and be informed, that the said defendant, combining and confederating with divers persons, at present to the said Attorney General unknown, whose names, when discovered, the said Attorney General prays that he may be at liberty to insert herein, with apt and proper words to charge them as parties defendant hereto, and contriving how to wrong and injure the plaintiff and all the people of the state of Wisconsin, in the premises, has absolutely refused, and still does so refuse, to comply with the requirements of the aforesaid act, and has adopted and issued a tariff of rates for freights and passengers transported over its roads within said state, and a classification of freight, each and all of which are in disregard of the classi- fication and rates fixed by the said last mentioned act, and contrary to the requirements thereof. That said defendant has also issued to its officers, agents and servants (each and all of whom the plaintiff prays may be made parties defendant to this article, with apt and proper words to charge them) instructions to charge, demand and receive of all persons passing over their road or shipping freights thereon, the rates and compensations therefor in the said tariff and schedules so issued by the said defendant, which said last mentioned rates and compensations are different, higher and greater than those limited and authorized by the said act, and in excess of the power and authority conferred upon the defendant by law; and that the said defendant, its agents, servants, officers and employes have all the time, since the said 28th day of April, 1874, charged, demanded and received of and from persons carried over their said railroad, and of and from persons shipping goods, wares and merchandise to be carried between places in this state, rates and compensations therefor higher and greater than those fixed and authorized by the said last mentioned act of the legislature, and greater and higher than said defendant is empowered by law to ask, demand or receive. And the said Attorney General further, as aforesaid, alleges and shows to the court that the said defendant has, ever since the 28th day of April, 1874, used and operated its railroad within the state of Wisconsin in direct viola- tion of the act last above mentioned, in defiance of law, and contrary to the authority granted to it by law, and that it still does so use and operate its rail- road, and now is daily and habitually charging and receiving greater and higher rates and compensations for the transportation of freights and passen- gers upon its said road within this state, than are fixed, established and al- lowed by the said last mentioned act of the legislature; that said rates are so charged and received by said defendant as aforesaid, for carrying freights &quot; &quot;Summary of Conclusions. 139 12.

The loading of the car was done by Mr. Obrecht, and the overloading was not only unjust to the company in reducing amount of freight, but in endanger- ing the car itself from the over-weight, and certainly the company had a right to charge 26,000 lbs. when that amount was actually carried. This car was weighed, and its weight was accurately determined. I am directed by Mr. Keep to say to you that this company, in all cases, will carry freight at the rates named in the Potter law; that it is not true that we have refused to do so for Mr. Obrecht; nor would it insist on the payment of freight in advance from him, as it has the right to do under the law, if he would agree either to unload the cars within a reasonable and proper time for that purpose, or in default thereof, to pay demurrage for the detention of the cars, what such proper and reasonable time shall be, to be also agreed upon according to the usual rule adopted by railroads in such cases. Mr. Keep instructed me to say that this company will use the utmost frank- ness with the commissioners in reference to any matter of complaint, giving the facts in each case as they are understood by the officers of the company, and that he earnestly desires to avoid all just causes of complaint or irritation, and to cultivate the same good feeling between the company and its patrons in Wisconsin, that it would do if its business were prosperons and remuner- ative. Very respectfully, B. C. COOK, General Solicitor of Company. To the Board of R. R. Commissioners of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis. OFFICE OF RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS, MADISON, November 6, 1874. Hon. ALBERT KEEP, Pres&apos;t. C. &amp;amp; N. W. R. R. Co.&apos; DEAR SIR: Complaints continue to be received by the Commissioners, of illegal charges for freight by the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Com- pany. Your communication of October 26th, through Mr. Cook, distinctly stated that your company &amp;quot;would, in all cases, carry freight at the rates named in the Potter Law.&amp;quot; It is possible that the understanding of the law by the company may not be in accordance with that of the Commissioners and Attorney General. On no other supposition can the charges which are re- ported to have been made, be accounted for. A single example will serve to illustrate the cases: A car of lumber sent from Rudd&apos;s Mills to Madison, is, in accordance with the &amp;quot;Potter Law,&amp;quot; understood to have been received at Rudd&apos;s Mills, and to be chargable with rates for 112 miles, which, legally, would be $18.50. As the charge reported to be made for the service is $28, some other view of the law must be held by the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Company. Section 5 of the Potter Law provides, that in computing the rates for carrying any freight, the distance for carrying such freight &amp;quot;shall be computed &quot; &quot;201 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

Secretary of State. &quot; &quot;96 Report of Railroad Commissioners. 1871, the increase in the total stock and debt of the company was $6,267,268. Nearly all this increase was thus apportioned: for purchase of road from Nora Springs to Algona, 63 miles, bonds, $1,008,000, preferred stock, $504,000 and common stock $504,000-total, $2,016,000-$32,000 per mile. For purchase of road from Austin to state line-11 miles-preferred stock, $176,000 and common stock $176,000; total, $352,000-$32,000 per mile. For purchase of road from state line to Mason City-29 miles-preferred stock, $400,000 and common stock $400,000; total, $800,000-$27,586 per mile. On Prairie du Chien Railway stock-preferred stock, $835,000 and common stock $833,000, total, $1,668,000. For purchase of Western Union stock, it being a majority of that stock at 75 per cent. in St. Paul common stock, $1,500,750. For diyi- dends on earnings of 1869, $828,900. For dividends on earnings of 1870, com- mon stock, $747,291. Dec. 31, 1871, the total cost of the whole road, less cost of Western Union stock, was reported at $39,279.100, or $38,580 per mile. During the year, the company earned 7 per cent. net on its preferred stock, and over 6 per cent. on its common stock. It paid 7 per cent. in cash to its preferred stockholders, and deferred the dividends on the common stock, haying used the amount for this purpose in the improvement and acquisition of additional property. January 1, 1872, the company leased the Oshkosh and Mississippi Railroad from Oshkosh to Ripon, 20 miles, paying as a rental therefor, 35 per cent of the gross earnings. The company also leased the Hastings and Dakota road, from Hastings to Carver, 48 miles, finished to Glencoe July 1, 1872, making 75 miles in all, paying as a rental therefor $1,500 per mile of finished road per annum, and subsequently purchased the same for $1,350,000 in bonds, and $750,000 in stock, $28,000 per mile. The company also purchased, January 1, 1872, of the Chicago and St. Paul Railroad Company, the line extending from St. Paul to Winona and La Crescent, then in operation from St. Paul to Wi- nona, 103 miles, and not completed to La Crescent, 27 miles. The price paid for this road was £800,000 in 7 per cent. bonds of the company, payable in Lon- don in 1902, about $30,000 per mile. The company also purchased the Sabu- la, Ackley and Dakota Railroad, from Sabula to Marion, Iowa, 87 miles, pay- ing therefor $1,485,000 in bonds, and $825,000 in common stock; total, $2,310,000, about $26,550 per mile. These purchases increased the length of lines both owned and operated by the company from 1,018 miles to 1,283 miles, exclusive of the Western Union, all leased road, and the contemplated road from Winona to La Crescent.

DEED CONVEYING THE MINNESOTA CENTRAL RAILWAY FROM AUSTIN TO THE STATE LINE-11 MILES-TO THE MILWAU- KEE AND ST. PAUL RAILWAY COMPANY. This indenture, made the 15th day of February, A. D. 1870, by and between the Minnesota Central Railway Company, a corporation duly incorporated under the laws of the state of Minnesota, of the first part, and the Milwaukee &quot; &apos;The Problem to be Solved. 75 &quot;The foregoing provisions, as also those contained in Art. 42 to 45, do not apply to Bavaria, The Empire, however, remains invested with the right, even as concerns Bavaria, to lay down, by legislative means, uniform rules for the construction and equipment of such railways as are of importance to the defense of the country. “ART. 47. All railway administrations are bound unconditionally to obey the demands of the authorities of the Empire as regards the use of the rail- ways for the defense of Germany. In particular, soldiers and all war mate- rial must be transported at uniformly reduced rates.&quot; The laws now in force wisely regulate the matter of through shipments; under general restrictions, leave the companies consid- erable freedom as to tariffs; require publicity of rates, as in France; are steadily arriving at a desirable uniformity in the matter of classification and working arrangements; and distinctly assert the right of state supervision. Considerable complaint is made since the Franco-Prussian war, of a want of facilities for the rapidily growing traffic, but the system as such appears to have the approval of the people. 4. The Austrian railway system. The Austrian closely resembles the German system, being mixed as to ownership and state management. In fact, however, but a very inconsiderable proportion of the lines is worked by the state. The concessions are granted by the emperor for a term not exceed- ing 90 years, when the line, with their appurtenances, become the property of the state, the rolling stock still remaining the property of the companies. Every charter includes a maximum of rates or charges, but under the maximum the company has general license, subject to a triennial approval by the minister of commerce, and the further provision that when the net profits exceed 15 per cent. the government can reduce the maxima. The government has guaranteed interest on a large proportion of the aggregate cost of the roads. The management is obnoxious to but little censure. In some respects, it is most admirable. The passenger service is es- pecially good. 5. Other countries having similar systems. Italy, Russia and the Scandinavian states have essentially the German and Austrian systems. They are the more backward of the European states in their railway development, especially Rus- sia, which has but 1 mile of railway to 284 square miles of area, and &apos; &apos;84 Report of Railroad Commissioners. acter, and because it does not allow the companies to explain the reason of the discrimination, but forfeits their franchise upon an arbitrary and conclu- sive presumption of guilt to be drawn from the proof of an act that might be shown to be perfectly innocent. In these particulars the existing law violates the spirit of the constitution. The judgment of the circuit court ousting the appellant of its franchises, must therefore be reversed.&quot; In May, 1873, a new law was passed; a leading characteristic be- ing that it recognizes the principles laid down by the supreme court, namely, that railroad charges must, under the common law, be reasonable. Accordingly it prescribes what shall be prima facie evidence of extortion and unjust discrimination, and imposes upon the railway companies theburden of proof that the act complained of is just and reasonable. It also requires the commissioners to prepare schedules of rates for the several roads, with power to change them at discretion; these rates, likewise, to be held judicially reasonable until otherwise declared by the verdict of a jury. Under its provisions the com- missioners prepared schedules of rates, and have since been actively employed in enforcing the law, though without the most gratifying success. The corporations are many of them persistent in operat- ing their roads under their own tariffs, and others, affecting a substantial compliance with the law, are seeking by various means to render it odious with the public. The report of the commissioners for 1874 indicates confidence in the wisdom of the present policy and in the final triumph of the law over all opposition. 9. In Wisconsin. The railway legislation of Wisconsin, while it is due in general to the same causes which have induced restrictive legislation else- where, was hastened, we may say pricipitated, by the impolitic and unjust action of some of the railway companies in making an increase upon their usual charges-already considered quite too high. —in the autumn of 1873, when, for the first time in three years, the product of our agricultural industry had come up to the annual average. The practical character of the law passed at the next subsequent session of the legislature is quite fully considered in another por- tion of this report; while its validity is ably set forth in the opin- ions of the Supreme Court of the state, and of the United States &apos; &quot;184 Appendix. Third. Any surplus rental, if any there be, shall be paid to the party of the first part within thirty days after the expiration of each year, such pay. ments to be made at the office of the party of the second part in the city of New York. Provided, however, That whenever it shall be reasonably apparent to the parties hereto that the amount of average yearly rental accruing under the terms of this lease to the party of the first part, shall be sufficient, from the earnings of the year, to pay the interest on the bonds aforesaid and the sink- ing fund for such year, then and in that event the party of the second part shall pay over to the party of the first part, within thirty days after the close of each and every half year, any surplus rental which shall remain, after pay- ment or reservation of the half year&apos;s interest, and the amount then due upon said sinking fund. All such payments shall be made free and clear of and from all taxes charges, impositions and assessments, and such rent shall be so paid during The whole of said term, notwithstanding any future action of either of the parties hereto, or of any majority of the respective stockholders thereof, as to and concerning any other matter herein contained. And in order to secure the individual interest of each stockholder of the party of the first part in and to the said rent, the right is hereby given to each and every stockholder to prosecute such suits as may be necessary in the premises to recover his proportionate amount thereof, using, if needful, the name of the corporation; and this provision may, if desired, be indorsed upon the certificate of stock issued by the party of the first part. 9. The said party of the second part further covenants and agrees that it will maintain the line of railroad hereby leased in good condition and re- pair, and will maintain the equipment thereof in a suitable and proper condi- tion to transact all the business of said road during the continuance of this lease, and that it will operate the said line of railroad, at all times as the bu- siness of said road may require; and that it will keep in proper form the ac- counts of the business and operations of said line of railroad hereby leased, showing all the receipts to a participation in which the parties of the first part are entitled by their agreement and the source thereof; and a general and approximate abstract of the said business shall be made up as often as once a month, and that it will at all reasonable and proper times submit to the inspection of the said party of the first part, or its authorized agent, the books containing the entries of the gross receipts, and will give any needful and proper information as to the same. 10. Full statements showing the receipts and disbursements on account of the company, on, from and in behalf of the line of the railroad hereby leased, made in such form as to exhibit accurately the amount and character of the gross receipts of the railroad hereby leased, shall be delivered as often as once annually, if required, to the party of the first part, and the party of the second part shall, in due season, furnish to the party of the first part all such statements and information, so far as it may have the control thereof, which shall be necessary to enable the party of the first part to comply with any requirements of, and in the making of reports under its charter as re- quired by the laws of the state. 11. And the said party of the second part does further covenant and agree that in regard to all fines and penalties imposed by law for the commission of any act prohibited, or the omission of any act or duty enjoined in the op- eration of said railroad, and in respect to all damages or injury to persons or property in anywise arising from the acts or negligence of the party of the second part or its agents, and in respect to damages or injuries to persons in anywise arising or accruing upon said road during its operation and manage- ment by the party of the second part, and generally in reference to all inci- dental and accidental risks and liabilities assumed by a railroad corporation owning and operating its road, the party of the second part shall become and it agrees to be liable to the same extent as if it were the actual owner of the line of railroad hereby leased, and to assume and pay all such demands and liabilities, and to protect the estate hereby leased against the effect, charge or lien of any judgment or decree rendered on account of such liability. 12. The party of the second part hereby agrees to pay all taxes which may be assessed by virtue of the laws of the state of Wisconsin, or the United &quot; &quot;REPORT. To the Honorable Legislature of the State of Wisconsin: The Railroad Commissioners, in submitting their first annual re- port, deem it proper to make mention of the inherent difficulties of the task assigned them, and the extraordinary embarrassments they have encountered. In some of its provisions, the law under which they were re- quired to act was found to be technically imperfect, and in other respects obviously impracticable. Construed in the most literal manner, it imposed duties for which neither the time allotted them, nor the means at their command, were found sufficient. In addi- tion to this, it became manifest to the commissioners soon after their appointment, not only that the law was met by the more pow- erful railway corporations with a determined resistance, the public press teeming meanwhile with declarations of its injustice, imprac- ticability and unconstitutionality, but that, on the other hand, that portion of the public interested in the execution of the law, and even prominent jurists whose opinions had the weight of authority, were looking to the board for the enforcement of all its provisions. Moreover, quite early in the season, as is well known, the vital principle of the law-involving the constitutional relations of the state to corporate power-was vigorously contested before the courts of the state and of the United States. While the progress already made toward a final settlement of the fundamental issue thus created-progress chiefly due to the efforts of the executive department—and the consequent acquiescence, for the time being, of the railroad corporations in the settlement of the issue thus cre- ated, have relieved the commissioners in a good degree from some of the embarrasments they met at the outset, it should nevertheless be borne in mind, that from first to last, they have found themselves in the midst of circumstances less than favorable to the most satis- factory progress of their labors. 2-R.

J. W. HoYT, Commissioners: GENTLEMEN :—I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your com- munication of the 4th inst., in which you do me the favor to request a brief but complete description of the pontoon railway bridge at Prairie du Chien. This bridge, it is proper to say, was built and is being operated by me by virtue of an agreement with the Milwaukee, Chicago and Saint Paul Railway Company. It was finished for the passage of trains on the fifteenth day of April last, since which time it has been in successful use. It is located be- tween Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, and McGregor, Iowa, at which points it connects the river termination of the Prairie du Chien and Iowa and Minne- sota divisions of the St. Paul Company&apos;s lines. It extends across both chan- nels of the Mississippi river and an intervening island, the total length being seven thousand and two hundred feet. The structure consists of sub- stantial piling except its pontoon draws, of which there are two, one across each navigable channel. Each pontoon is four hundred feet long, thirty feet wide, five feet deep, trussed through and through, provided with suitable machinery, and operated by steam power.

FROM PORTAGE CITY, BERLIN, DOTY&apos;S ISLAND OR FOND DU LAC, IN A NORTHWESTERN DIRECTION, TO BAYFIELD, AND THENCE TO SUPERIOR, ON LAKE SUPERIOR. (Wisconsin Central.) This grant was made May 5, 1864, vol. 13, page 66, U. S. Statutes. The grant is ten miles wide, and deficiencies are to be selected within twenty mile limits. The grant was conferred by the legislature of the state of Wisconsin, partly upon the “ Winnebago and Lake Superior Railroad Company,&amp;quot; and partly upon the &amp;quot;Portage and Superior Railroad Company.&amp;quot; The former April 6, 1866, chap. 314; and the latter April 9, 1666, chap. 362. The two companies were consolidated under the name of the &amp;quot;Portage, Winnebago and Superior Railroad Company,” March 6, 1869, chap. 257. By joint resolution, adopted by congress June 21, 1866, the words, &amp;quot;in a northwestern direction,&amp;quot; were construed to authorize the location of the road from Portage City, by the way of Ripon and Berlin, to Stevens Point, and thence to Bayfield, and thence to Superior, on Lake Superior. By act of the legislature of the state of Wisconsin, approved February 4, 1871, the name of the company was changed to the &amp;quot;Wisconsin Central Rail- road Company.&amp;quot; In 1869, the quantity of land estimated to be included in this grant, as shown by the report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office for that year, was 1,800, 000 acres. But, in the report for 1873, this estimate was re- duced to 750, 000 acres.

AMENDMENT OF ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION OF MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL RAILWAY COMPANY. At a meeting of the stockholders of the Milwaukee &amp;amp; St. Paul Railway Company, held at the office of the company, on Thursday, the 20th day of June, A. D. 1867, the following resolutions were passed: Resolved, That our articles of association be, and the same are hereby, amended by adding thereto the following amendment: Amendment of the Articles af Association of the Milwaukee &amp;amp; St. Paul Railway Company. The undersigned, a majority in interest of the various classes of stock in the Milwaukee &amp;amp; St. Paul Railway Company, hereby amend our articles of association, so that the directors are authorized to make one or more mort- gages or trust deeds upon the whole or any part of any line of railway, in- cluding its equipments, supplies and franchises, which shall hereafter be owned or the possession thereof acquired, by the Milwaukee &amp;amp; St. Paul Rail- way Company, in a similar manner and form as the mortgages upon our pres- ent line of road, and to the same amount per mile, which mortgages or trust deeds may contain the covenants and agreements usual in railway mortgages. The future mortgages made by this company may bear a rate of interest not exceeding eight per cent. per annum, and bonds secured thereby may be in sums of one thousand dollars ($1,000), or five thousand dollars ($5,000), each, or in such other amounts as the directors think expedient. And a stock vote having been called thereon, the following stockholders voted in the affirmative: NAMES. Scrip. Preferred. Common. J. Bacon and H. Gassett, Trustees.... 28 9 A. H. Barney 400 70 Robt.

In addition to this amount, a small amount in stock has been distributed in dividends to represent that portion of the net earnings used in completing the construction of and im- proving the property. These stock dividends amount to 2 8-10 per cent. per annum. With these stock dividends added to the cash dividends above named, at their nominal value, and the whole amount received on the investment for interest and cash and stock dividends, amounts to only six per cent. per an- num of the actual cost of the property. I submit to your Excellency, and through you to the people of the state, whether this is more than a fair and reasonable return for the capital invested in these improvements. Is it not far below such reasonable amount? The best and most careful economists ad- mit that not less than ten per cent. per annum should be allowed on such in- vestments. Yet less than one-half that amount has been received in cash, by this company, and the legislature now attempts to assume the regulation of our income and reduce it to a point barely above operating expenses. The company is now engaged in re-laying its road with steel rails, and when that and other improvements shall have been completed, it is hoped that mo- derate and reasonable dividends may be made on the actual cost of the road, and that our increased facilities may enable us to reduce the rates charged for passengers and freight. The directors of this company have at all times had a due regard to the interests of the public and a desire to furnish transportation at the lowest possible figure, and although not receiving a fair and reasonable return on their investments, they have, for the last four years prior to 1873, steadily re- duced their rates of freight and passengers, from year to year, as will be seen from the following table, showing the charge for freight per mile, and aver- age per mile for passengers, for each year, from 1867 to 1873, inclusive: Freight per Passengers ton per mile. per mile. 1867. 1868 1869 1870. 1871. 1872 1873. 86 92 $0.04 $0 03,40 03,0% 10 02-188% 02 03100 03100 43 02-40% 02 Foo 50 5 75 54 03 03-700 03700 0318% 42 The law in question proposes to reduce our passenger rates 25 per cent., and our freight rates about the same, thus deducting from our present tariff about 25 per cent. of our gross earnings. The same legislature also imposed upon us an additional tax of one per cent. of our gross earnings, which is equivalent to taking three per cent of our net earnings. It is not pretended that we are now running too many trains or too great a rate of speed to accommodate the public, or that any less attention and ex- pense can be bestowed upon our road bed and track or rolling stock, consist- ent with the safe operation of our road. Hence it is impossible for us to decrease the expense of operation and repair, and those expenses must remain as before the passage of the law, provided we continue to operate the road as a first class road and so as to accommodate the public. The entire reduction in our rates made by this act is, therefore, a reduction from our net earnings. The average expenses of operation are not less than two-thirds of our entire gross earnings, leaving a net of about one-third. This act, as we have seen, proposes to take from us twenty-five per cent. of our passenger and freight earnings, and the additional tax of one per cent. of our gross earnings, all of which is equivalent to taking from us twenty-six per cent. of our gross earnings. Therefore, deducting this amount, equal to twenty-six per cent. of our entire gross earnings, from thirty-three per cent., our average net earnings on business would leave us only seven per cent. of our gross earnings, as the entire net earnings of the road, out of which must &quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 173 ST.

All may go on the relation of a private person, and may involve private right. It is the duty of the court to confine the exercise of its original jurisdiction to ques- tions publici juris. And hereafter the court will require all classes of cases, as it has hitherto done some, in which it is sought to put its original juris- diction in motion, to proceed upon leave first obtained, upon a prima facie showing that the case is one of which it is proper for the court to take cognizance. Although the writ of injunction was at no time properly a jurisdictional writ, it has long been held to be a judicial writ only, used to give effect to the general jurisdiction of courts of equity, yet in the early history of the English chancery, the use of the writ rested on a jurisdiction of its own, bor- rowed from the Roman law by the Churchmen who first sat in that court. 1 Spence, 668. And this early use of the writ as a quasi jurisdictional writ, has aided us in giving to it the construction and use in the constitution, which we adopt. We ought, perhaps, earlier in the discussion, to have indicated another section of article VII of the constitution, which has aided our conclu- sion. Section eight gives jurisdiction to the circuit courts, original in all matters, civil and criminal, within the state, not excepted in the constitution or thereafter prohibited by law, and appellate from all inferior courts and tribunals, and supervising control over the same, and also power to issue writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, injunction, quo warranto, certiorari and all other writs necessary to carry into effect their judgments, etc., and general control over inferior courts and jurisdictions. A great jurisdiction compre- hending as C. J., Stow remarked in Putnam v. Sweet, the united powers of the English courts of the King&apos;s Bench, Common Pleas, Exchequer and Chan- cery. The same writs are granted to those courts as to this. It is impossible for a lawyer to suppose that they are granted in the same sense and with the same measure of jurisdiction, to this court as those courts. Such a proposi- tion would shock the legal sense of any professional man. And the distinct- tion is to be looked for, and is readily found, in the general constitution and functions of those courts and of this. The writs are given to the circuit courts as an appurtenance to their general original jurisdiction; to this court for jurisdiction. Those courts take the writs with unlimited original juris- diction of them, because they have otherwise general original jurisdiction. Other original jurisdiction is prohibited to this court, and the jurisdiction given by the writs is essentially a limited one. Those courts take the prero- gative writs as a part of their general jurisdiction, with power to put them to all proper uses. This court takes the prerogative writs for prerogative jurisdiction, with power to put them only to prerogative uses proper. The circuit courts take the writ of injunction with all the powers and all the uses of the English court of chancery. This court takes it as an integral ele- ment of its jurisdiction of prerogative writs. And it would be a rude and criminal emasculation of the judicial charter of the state, to disfranchise this court of all jurisdiction or use of injunction, as it would be a wild and reck- less delusion, undiscerning the symmetrical distribution of judicial powers in the constitution, to attribute to this court the same jurisdiction and uses of the writ which the circuit courts have. And so the difficulty which seemed so great, becomes so little, and is over- come, as difficulties often are, by being directly met and carefully examined. And thus we find that Smith J., was more apparently than really inaccurate in Attorney General v. Blossom when he classed injunction with the other writs given, and called the whole group prerogative and original writs. For, in our view of its use, the injunction given to this court seems to become a quasi prerogative writ, and founds jurisdiction as if it were an original writ. It is certainly competent for the constitution to give new writs or to put old writs to new uses; to make any writ, by the use to which it puts it, prerogative or original; and to found jurisdiction on any writ, as in case of a prerogative or original writ. And this it appears to have done, in effect, with the injunc- tion which it gives to this court. We therefore hold that the court has original jurisdiction of an information on behalf of this state, in the nature of an injunction bill in chancery, in all cases coming within the scope of original jurisdiction conferred on this court &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 113 MILWAUKEE AND MISSISSIPPI RAILROAD, ALSO MILWAUKEE AND PRAIRIE DU CHIEN RAILWAY-Statement of Cost- from the Reports of the Company.

The motion for an injuction is overruled. SUGGESTIONS BY JUSTICE DAVIS. In view of the decision just rendered, we trust it will not be considered out of the line of our duty to make a suggestion concerning this litigation to the counsel for the defendants. It is manifest that the questions involved are grave ones, and that the courts of last resort will ultimately have to pass upon them. It is equally manifest that a speedy decision, in which all par- ties are vitally interested, cannot be obtained unless there is harmony of ac- tion on the part of both the complainants and defendants. In the meantime, while this litigation is in progress, would it not be better for the defendants, as far as lies in their power, to have prosecutions for penalties suspended? These prosecutions are not required to settle rights. They are attended with great expense, and if enforced while an effort is making in good faith, to test the validity of this legislation, must cause serious irritation, and cannot be, as it seems to us, productive of any good results. PETITION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR AN IN- JUNCTION. In Supreme Court. THE STATE OF WISCONSIN VS. THE CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN RAIL- WAY COMPANY. A. Scott Sloan, Attorney General of the state of Wisconsin, who sues for the said state in this behalf, and in its name, comes here into the supreme court judicature of said state, before the justice thereof, at the capítol, in the city of Madison, on the eighth day of July, in the June term of said court in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, and for and in the name of the said state, gives the court here to understand and be informed, and shows and alleges that the above named defendant in this action, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company is a corpora- tion duly created, organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the said state of Wisconsin. And the said Attorney General, in the name and in behalf of the said state, further gives the said court here to understand and be informed, and charges and alleges the truth to be that the said defendant, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company was incorporated by an act of the legislature of the state of Wisconsin, entitled &amp;quot;an act to incorpo- rate the Madison and Beloit Railroad Company, approved August 19, 1848, and an act of the legislature of the state of Wisconsin, entitled &amp;quot;an act to amend an act, entitled &apos;an act to incorporate the Madison and Beloit Railway Company,&amp;quot; approved February 19, 1850, and the acts amendatory of the afore- said acts, and supplementary thereto. And the said Attorney General further gives the court to understand and be informed and avers that by an act of the legislature of the state of Wis- consin, entitled an act to authorize the railroad companies therein named to consolidate their capital stock, approved March 10, 1855, the said railroad company was authorized by its board of directors to select, choose and adopt for itself any name that a majority of the directors might see fit, and that subsequently a majority of said directors did duly select, choose and adopt the name of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway for said company. &quot; &quot;Remedial Measures. 113 be the enactment of stringent provisions of law requiring a greater publicity of rates of freight, together with sufficient pre- vious notice of changes in rates. The commissioners are of opin- ion that the adoption of such a requirement would not only prove beneficial to the public, but also to the companies. Under a sys- tem of practical secrecy in charges, favoritism is the necessary rule, and every shipper is inclined to demand proof from the company of that partiality to himself which he knows is claimed and obtained by others. The interests of business, moreover, demand certainty and uniformity in current expenditure, and no man with personal cred- it and fortune at stake ought to be subject either to the caprice or partiality of public agents. Whatever the rate demanded for any class of freight, that rate should be equal to all under the same cir- cumstances, and be definitely known to all, and none should be subject to the loss or annoyance of changes in that rate without an allowance of sufficient opportunity to accommodate his business to the exigency. The enforcement of such a regulation, furthermore, would necessarily go far toward removing public suspicion of spec- ulative management on the part of the directors and agents; and if accompanied by accurate reports of business done, under its proper classification, would strongly tend to extinguish any just cause of complaint on this account. Publicity of rates is nearly or quite universal in continental Europe, and is likely to become so in England also, if we may judge by the vigorous manner in which the necessity for publicity is urged by the Joint Select Committee of 1872, who say: &amp;quot;&amp;quot; Passenger fares are comparatively simple, and the companies are now re- quired to exhibit at each station a list of all the fares from that station to every place for which tickets are there issued. But with rates for goods it is very different. There are distinctions of all sorts. There are the rates to each station on the company&apos;s own line; there are the rates to every station on the lines of every other company to which the company books (or ships); aud those rates will vary according to the arrangements made by the com- pany with every other company over whose lines the goods are carried. There are the seven or eight classes of goods for which the company charge differ- ent rates. There are the equal mileage charges where the principle of equal mileage is adopted, and the special rates charged in the more numerous cases, where sea or other competition induces the company to charge special rates. And there are the numerous cases still less reducible to principles or rules capable of general statement, where the companies, in consideration of large and eonstant custom, or for other reasons, make especially favorable bargains with particular traders.&amp;quot; * * * * 8-R.

The grounds on which this jurisdiction rests are ancient; but the extent of its application has grown rapidly of late years, until a comparatively obscure and insignificant jurisdiction has become one of great magnitude and public import. The modern exercise of this jurisdiction has kept pace with the multiplication of great corporations in England. The cause may be found in the language of Lord Eldon already quoted, and the motive, in the lan- guage of Lord Cottenham, three times repeated: &amp;quot;I have before taken occa- sion to observe that I thought it the duty of this court to adapt its practice and course of proceedings as far as possible to the existing state of society, and to apply its jurisdiction to all those new cases which, from the progress daily making in the affairs of men, must continually arise; and not from too strict an adherence to forms and rules established under very different cir- cumstances, decline to administer justice and enforce rights for which there is no other remedy.&amp;quot; 1 Mylne and C., 559; 4 ib., 141, 635. In our day the common law has encountered in England as in this coun- try, a new power, unknown to its founders, practically too strong for its or- dinary private remedies. The growth of great corporations, centers of vast wealth and power, new and potent elements of social influence, overrunning this country with their works and their traffic, throughout all England, has been marvelous during the last half century. It is very certain that the country has gained largely by them in commerce and development. But such aggregations of capital and power, outside of public control, are dan- gerous to public and private right, and are practically above many public restraints of the common law and all ordinary remedies of the common law for private wrongs. Their influence is so large, their capacity of resistance so formidable, their powers of oppression so various, that few private persons could litigate with them; still fewer private persons would litigate with them, for the little rights or the little wrongs which go so far to make up the measure of average prosperity of life. It would have been a mockery of justice to have left corporations, counting their capital by millions-their lines of railroad by hundreds, and even, sometimes, by thousands of miles- their servants by multitudes-their customers by the active members of so- ciety-subject only to the common law liab.lities and remedies which were adequate protection against turnpike, and bridge and ferry companies, in one view of their relations to the public; and, in another view, to the same lia- bilities and remedies which were found sufficient for common carriers who carried passengers by a daily line of stages, and goods by a weekly wagon, or both by a few coasting or inland craft; with capital and influence often less than those of a prosperous village shopkeeper. The common law reme- dies, sufficient against these, were, in a great degree, impotent against the great railway companies-always too powerful for private right, often too powerful for their own good. It was in these circumstances that the English courts of equity applied their restraining jurisdiction, at public or private suit, and laid on these great companies the strong hand of equitable control. And all England had occasion to bless the courage and integrity of her great judges who used so ably and so freely and so beneficially the equity writ, and held great corporations to strict regard to public and private right. Every person suffering, or about to suffer their oppression, by a disregard of corpo- rate duty, may have his injunction. When their oppression becomes public, it is the duty of the Attorney General to apply for the writ on behalf of the public. And in this country, where the judicial tone is less certain, it is re- freshing to read the bold and true words of which English Equity judges do not spare the utterance. One of these corporations having violated an in- junction, V. C. Shadwell says: &amp;quot;Considering then their conduct to be at once contumacious and otherwise illegal, to be wrongful against the plaint- iff individually, wrongful against the Queen&apos;s subjects at large, and of, I had almost said, scandalous example; whatever amount of inconvenience may be the consequence of acting against the defendants on this occasion, I think it right to deal with them according to their merits. The consequence may &quot; &quot;44 Report of Railroad Commissioners. toon railway bridge now in use in this or any country. There is no other pontoon in the world that opens so wide a passage or that is so completely under command. The expense of operating it, in the event of boats or rafts requiring to pass, is but slight, and the economy of its use, as compared with the former means of transfer, is as one dollar to five dollars per car transferred. An interesting communication on the subject of this bridge, from Gen. John Lawler, patentee and builder, will be found on pages 37 and 38. RAILROADS IN CONSTRUCTION. Of railroads in actual construction, no portion of which is yet opened for use, there are two-the Chicago and Tomah Railroad, and the The Chicago and Tomah Road is now in progress in the valley of the Kickapoo. Work commenced at or near Wauzeka, on the Wis- consin river, in Crawford county. The objective point is Tomah. Thirty and a half miles are now under construction; the funds being wholly furnished along the line. It is the purpose of the company to lay maple rail at first, leaving the purchase of iron until the increase of traffic renders it necessary.

Assuming this to be but the beginning of an investigation of the whole subject of railway transportation, and hence realizing the importance to the legislature and the public of all the data that can be furnished in aid of just conclusions, the commissioners have spared no pains either in collecting facts for their own use, or in collating and preparing for publication such of them as will need to be accessible in the future. OFFICIAL PAPERS OF THE COMMISSION. Under this head are published a number of the circulars, blanks and written inquiries sent out during the season, with the answers thereto; also, a few of the complaints made of violations of chap- ter 273 of the laws of 1874, since the injunction granted to the state by the Supreme Court took effect, and was publicly and offi- cially acquiesced in by the companies who were parties to that suit, together with portions of the correspondence relating thereto.

In those foreign countries where the practice of the government is to manifest its authority by prompt and decided measures, crush- ing out at once the first indication of an opposing element, we find that the circumstances which developed the necessity for its inter- ference with railroad corporations found ready response, and the strong arm of the superior power stretched forth to withold, to regulate, to control, and finally possess, if deemed essential for the public interest. Such seems to have been the case in many conti- nental European states, while in Great Britain the practice pre- sents features more in harmony with the character of that govern- ment; and while no governmental ownership or control interferes or competes with citizens in their business enterprises, it at the same time exercises a regulating supervision intended to protect the public. STATE OWNERSHIP INAPPLICABLE. It is hardly worth while to give any extended consideration to what may be termed the &quot;ownership theory.&quot; However practica- ble such a system may be under continental European governments, and within the limits of their national lines, it is obviously far less practicable in this country than even in Great Britain. While the public reports of Great Britain upon the subject of railroads, an- nounce dissatisfaction at every method which had been attempted, yet they in nowise recommend the adoption of whole or partial ownership, considering it not in consonance with the spirit of that government. Brief allusion to the main points of the ownership theory and the general principle tried in Great Britain, may perhaps serve to make apparent where the advantages or disadvantages lie. The principal object ostensibly aimed at by the state control of railways is the regulation of charges; and the argument used in favor of state ownership is, that the state could regulate the charges not only of the road or roads that it owned, but also, by competition, regulate them upon others which the state did not own. This being the theory, ownership in Europe, wherever employed, is only partial, as will appear from the following tabular statement, showing the mileage of European railways owned and operated by &apos; &apos;Evils of Railway Construction and Mauagement. 63 naturally enough, in such cases, this view of the matter enters into the understanding of all subordinate officers and employès. 1. Disregard of the public convenience. The results are, a disregard of the interests of thepublic and a bearing which repels those whom the corporations have need to conciliate; And where these characterize the general management, there must, of necessity, follow a general failure to appreciate the wants of the public; and, again, as consequents of such failure, re- pression of industrial enterprise, where there ought to be every encouragement; a lack of the patronage the company would other- wise secure; and finally, the deep-seated and permanent ill-will of the people with whom they have to do such business as they do not succeed in preventing or in driving away. This unfortunate disposition on the part of many railway man- agers has been fostered and strengthened by the readiness with which legislatures have yielded to their demands, and the almost absolute freedom from restraint of any sort which the corporations have hitherto enjoyed. 2. Failure to appreciate the real interests of company. Again, this cultivated disregard of the desires and interests of the public is not unfrequently accompanied by a lamentable lack of judgment as to what are practically the real interests of the com- pany served, by a short-sightedness and lack of comprehension which results in the adoption of a narrow and prejudicial, rather than a broad and liberal policy, so essential to the building up of a prosperous business where there was none before, or to the proper nursing of a traffic already begun. It is not uncommon for railway companies to fail entirely of important gains because their man- agers are unable to see the advantage that would come of better local facilities for the shipping of freight, of cheap trains at conve- nient hours, or of rates low enough to stimulate production and encourage travel. The subject of unjust discriminations has been already alluded to under the head of &quot;Management in the Interest of Managers.&quot; Such discriminations are not always made, however, in the interest of managers, or the friends of managers. Sometimes they have origin in the false impression that they are essential to the business prosperity of the company.

Yours truly, A. SCOTT SLOAN, Att&apos;y General. SOLICITOR B. C. COOK TO ATTORNEY GEN. SLOAN. CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN RAILWAY Co., Office of the Gen. Solicitor, Hon. A. SCOTT SLOAN, Att&apos;y Gen. of Wisconsin. CHICAGO, NOV. 11, 1874. DEAR SIR: Yours of the 10th inst. is received. I thank you for calling my attention to the matter of complaint. By referring to the communication sent yesterday by H. H. Porter, our General Manager, to Mr. Osborn, Rail- way Commissioner, you will see that the over-charge, to which you refer, was a mistake. It is impossible to prevent mistakes occurring at any time, much more is it impossible now, when the rates of freight and the manner of doing business have been entirely changed by the Potter Law, so as to produce very great confusion, especially when freight is received from other roads. In the matter referred to in Mr. Osborn&apos;s letter to Mr. Porter, instructions were issued from the General Manager&apos;s office to refund the amount claimed to be an over charge. There is no design on the part of this company to charge any higher rates than allowed by the Potter Law. In case where such charges are made, they will be immediately refunded. There is a question to which I wish to call your attention particularly. When freight is delivered from one road to another, is the rate to be com- puted by the second road only at the lower price fixed by the Potter Law, and is one road to be paid one price for carrying freight, say fifty miles, and the other road to be paid a far less sum for carrying the same freight fifty miles over its road, or should the whole amount of the freight for 100 miles be pro-rated between the two roads? I will be glad to have an official construction of the law upon this point, in order that we may avoid any question in relation to over charges on goods received from another. I freely confess to you that I cannot determine what the meaning of the Potter Law is in this regard. I am anxious, and so are all the officers of this company, to avoid any just or reasonable ground of com- plaint. It is said that the supreme court have decided in the Oconomowoc case what the principle shall be. If they have done so, and if the question is settled, we shall abide by it, however injuriously it may affect our interests. Will you please give me the substance of the Oconomowoc decision in brief statement. I also wish to direct your attention to the whole correspondence between Mr. Porter and Mr. Osborn, and to say, that the circular, a copy of which was sent to Mr. Osborn by Mr. Porter, will be withdrawn in compliance with a &quot; &apos;120 Report of Railroad Commissioners. This subject has been already alluded to under the head of &quot;inefficiency of management,&quot; and hence may be the more likely briefly discussed in this connection. Its importance is not to be overrated. If railroad managers were sufficiently impressed with this impor- tance nothing further would be necessary, since the companies have in fact every motive for giving satisfaction to the public and avoiding the many expenses entailed by accidents, whether to per- sons or property. But as these natural motives do not invariably prove sufficient, it seems to be the duty of the state, as a means of promoting safety of travel, as well as economy of transportation, to see at least that the roads are kept in safe condition, To this end, no further legislation would be necessary, perhaps, than to duly authorize and empower the commissioners to make or procure such inspection, and to enforce suitable regulations in that regard, as is now done in some of the other states. IMPROVEMENTS IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY. Kindred to the matter of inspection is that of inquiry into the merits of various mechanical improvements looking to the safety of travel, such as automatic couplers, security platforms, safety switches, train brakes, etc. Where large pecuniary interests are involved in the introduction of any new invention, great caution is necessary, but the end sought is of sufficient importance to demand the attention of the state. BETTER POLICE REGULATIONS. The law of 1873 confers no power and imposes no duty upon the cosmmissioners respecting what may be termed police regulations in the management of railways. Some of the provisions of other stat- utes extend to this department, but no efficient system has been adopted, and the requirements are comparatively few and insuffici- ent. In this department of progress the railway management of the United States is far behind that of Europe, and that of Wis- consinsin far behind that of most of the older states of our own country. And yet no phase of the question of railway legisla- tion is of greater practical importance to the public, and that too, in respect to powers of the government which are undisputed. Safety of life and the due protection of property, as well as the comfort and convenience of passengers, largely depend upon the &apos; &quot;294 Report of Railroad Commissioners. the same terms generally as other towns were empowered to grant aid. Act approved July 13, 1853. Chap. 407, Laws of 1853, authorizes the Milwaukee and Watertown Rail- road to construct a branch road from the village of Columbus, in Columbia county, to Stevens Point, in Portage county, and when said extension was decided upon, to increase its capital to $2,000,000. All powers, privileges and immunities of the company&apos;s charter were extended to the proposed branch line. Act approved July 13, 1853. Chap. 47, Laws of 1854, authorizes the Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad Company to increase its capital stock to such an amount beyond the original sum named in the charter, as it may deem necessary to provide and secure means for the completion and equipment of said road between Milwaukee and Watertown, and to such additional amount as may be necessary to ex- change for such securities as have been or may hereafter be made converti- ble into the capital stock of said company by resolution of the board of di- rectors. Act approved Feb. 15, 1854. Chap. 110, Laws of 1854, amends the first section of the amendatory act of July 13, 1853, and the several acts amendatory thereto, and authorizes the Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad Company to lay out and construct a branch road from the village of Columbus via Montello, Steven&apos;s Point and Wausau, thence northerly through the valley of the Wisconsin river, by the most feasible route, to the head waters of the Montreal river, thence to the state line, and down the valley of said river to some practicable point on lake Superior, and to increase the capital stock to such an amount as the directors anight esteem expedient to carry out the provisions and objects of the act. Branch roads were required to be constructed in divisions; the avails of all stock liabilities for the construction and equipment of each, to be applied specially to and belong to the same. Act approved March 8, 1854. Chap. 294, Laws of 1854, authorizes the Watertown, and Madison Railroad, at any time after its organization, to consolidate its capital stock with that of the Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad Company, upon terms to be mutually agreed upon; the consolidated company to enjoy all the rights, privileges and immunities of the original companies. Act approved April 1, 1854. Chap. 220, Laws of 1855, authorizes and requires the mayor and common council of the city of Watertown to loan the credit of the city to the extent of $90,000, of which $40,000 was subscribed to the Milwaukee and Watertown, and $50,000 to the Watertown and Madison Railroad Company, with the usual provision as to security for the loan. Act approved March 23, 1855. Chap. 320, Laws of 1856, authorizes the city of Milwaukee to loan its credit to the Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad, to aid its construction between Watertown and the village of Columbus, in the sum of $35,000, upon the usual condition as to security. Act approved March 28, 1856. Chap. 517, laws of 1856, amends an act to incorporate the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, approved April 2, 1852, by authorizing it to consolidate its capital stock with the Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad Company. Upon consolidation, the charters of the two companies were &quot; &quot;Laws Relating to Railroads. 281 a judgment in favor of David Merrill, rendered Jan. 12, 1859, against the origi. nal company.

R. COMPANY. Capital stock, $5,000,000. Shall be managed by eleven directors, who shall be stockholders, and possess all the powers of the corporation. Direct- ors shall be chosen by the stockholders, and the number may be increased to fifteen. Directors may receive land or other estate, real, personal or mixed, in payment for stock; may mortgage their property to any extent, on such terms as they may think proper; may make any contract or agreement they may think proper, with any other railroad company, for the leasing or pur- chase of the whole or any part of said other railroad, or may lease or sell this road to any other company or persons, on such terms as they may think proper. The company may construct a road from some point in the city of La Crosse, by the way of Trempeleau and Fountain City, to Prescott, with such branches for connection with the Milwaukee and La Crosse Company, as the company shall determine: provided, this company shall not connect with the western division of said Milwaukee and La Crosse Road more than four miles out of the corporate limits of the city of La Crosse. The com. pany may &amp;quot;connect with any other railroad in this state,&amp;quot; and may &amp;quot;extend their line so far as may be necessary to make such connection,&amp;quot; and may consolidate with such other company. The company may create any debt and issue bonds not exceeding in amount the amount of the capital stock &quot; &quot;Records of Railway Companies. 105 tion is authorized to issue an additional amount of said bonds not exceeding two millions of dollars, and unless the corporation shall purchase or acquire either the Milwaukee and Horicon Railroad, or some or all the bonds which are a first lien thereon, in which event the corporation is authorized to issue an additional amount of said bonds not exceeding four hundred thousand dollars, all of said bonds shall bear an interest of not exceeding seven per centum per annum, the principal and interest payable in the city of New York, the interest semi-annually, the principle within thirty years from date, they shall also contain a provision, that if the company make default in the payment of interest or in the application of the sinking fund, as hereinafter provided for six months, the principal shall thereupon become due without demand or notice. The said corporation shall have power to secure the pay. ment of all of the bonds above authorized to be issued, by a mortgage or trust deed upon this purchase and all the real and personal property of the compa- ny now owned or to be hereafter acquired by them, and to embrace the entire corporate property and all its purchases and privileges. The mortgage shall also contain a provision for a sinking fund for the payment of said mortgage-bonds, by which the new company shall obligate themselves to pay to the trustees of said mortgage-bonds all such sums of money, less the expenses of sales, as shall be received from the sale of any lands which may have been or shall hereafter be donated or granted by either the United States or the state of Wisconsin to aid in building the road, or that shall in any manner be acquired by this company. And said lands shall be fairly, equitably valued and classified by the company or by such persons as they together shall appoint; and upon sale of said lands said mortgage-bonds may be received at par and accrued interest in payment therefor, and the bonds thus received in payment shall be imme- diately cancelled. The company shall keep a proper registry or account of all the bonds thus paid by them, and the number or amount of bonds thus cancelled shall be reported by said company to the stockholders at each annual meeting, and said bonds shall be presented and shown at each meeting, and said trust deed shall contain all other reasonable and proper provisions for making said lands the most productive and available to the company as a sinking fund for the payment of said bonds. The bonds received by said mortgage shall be convertible at the option of the holder into the preferred stock, at any time within ten days after any divi. dend shall have been declared, and become payable on said preferred stock. The said mortgage-deed and bonds shall be signed by the president or vice president and secretary, and the seal of the company shall be affixed thereto; and except, as herein expressly provided, the corporation shall have no power or authority to mortgage or otherwise encumber their property, real or personal, unless the assent in writing of a majority in interest of the owners and holders of all the capital stock, issued by said corporation, shall be first had and obtained authorizing the same, and no assent shall be taken from agents or by proxy, unless the power of attorney, held by the agent or proxy, shall expressly authorize such assent. And in the event of this company acquiring the said Eastern Division of the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad, the said mortage or trust deed shall also contain a provision requiring so many of the mortgage-bonds, above authorized to be issued, as are reserved for the payment of the first mortgage Eastern Division, to be cancelled from time to time, as the present sinking fund on that mortgage shall have cancelled of that mortgage. The said mortgage or trust deed may also contain covenants and agree- ments, authorizing bondholdors to vote in all stockholders meetings as fol- lows: each one hundred dollars of the principal of the outstanding bonds shall be entitled to one vote, and giving the bondholders the same pro rata voice in the management of the company with, and as if they were stock. holders to the amount of their bonds.

The immediate government and direction of the affairs of the company, shall be vested in a board of not less than nine or more than thir- teen directors, and after the period for which the present directors are desig. nated expires, said directors shall be chosen by the stockholders of the said company by ballot at their annual meeting in each year, and shall hold their &quot; &quot;Executive and Legal Documents. 45 has been misunderstood. It was a bill filed by one individual against anoth- er, to stay building an hospital for people infected with the small-pox, very near the homes of several tenants of the plaintiff. The court said, if it were a nuisance at all, it was a public nuisance; that bills of that sort were founded on nuisances at common law, and if a public nuisance it should be an infor- mation in the name of the Attorney General; and then it would be for his consideration whether he would file such information or not. Chancellor Kent throws out a doubt whether it was not meant that the Attorney General might file an information in the King&apos;s Bench. Such has not been held to be the meaning by English lawyers or courts, and it appears to me their con- struction is the right one.&amp;quot; This is feeble language compared with the English cases cited. It is cer- tainly not true in our day, that the English courts rarely exercise the juris- diction; and the caution which the Chancellor attributes to Lord Eldon has long since passed out of the court. It may be safely assumed that the Chan- cellor of New Jersey who asserted the jurisdiction then, would be less timid in doing so now. But in that day he adds: &amp;quot;The very fact, however, that there may be a doubt on the subject by intel- ligent jurists, should be sufficient to induce caution on the part of this court. In cases of public nuisance there is an undisputed jurisdiction in the com- mon law courts by indictment, and a court of equity ought not to interfere in a case of misdemeanor, when the object sought can be as well attained in the ordinary tribunals.&amp;quot; And so, asserting the jurisdiction, he denied the motion. In 1836, notwithstanding the cases presently noticed in 2 Johns Ch.-and Hopkins, Chancellor Walworth asserted and enforced the jurisdiction in New York. The Attorney General filed an information to restrain the de- fendant corporation, claiming a right so to do, from tapping a canal. The Chancellor sustained the jurisdiction and the injunction, saying: &amp;quot;This court has jurisdiction to restrain any poupresture or unauthorized appropriation of public property to private use, which may amount to a pub- lic nuisance, or may injuriously affect or endanger the public interest. And when the officers entrusted with the protection of such public interests, act- ing under the sanction of their official oaths, believe the intended encroach- ment will prove injurious to the navigation of the canals, private persons should not be permitted to interfere with the waters or embankments of the canals, contrary to law, upon a mere opinion, although under the sanction of an oath, that the intended trespass upon the public rights would not be an in- jury to the public. Att&apos;y General v. Cahoes County, 6 Paige, 133. In emer- gency, the New York chancery overlooked Chancellor Kent&apos;s coy doubts and nice subtleties, and assumed the jurisdiction which he had involved in such learned obscurity. In Georgetown v. Alexandria Canal Co., 12 Peters, 91, which was a bill to re- strain the defendants from erecting a nuisance under their charter, decided in 1838, in the supreme court of the United States, thus state the jurisdiction: &amp;quot;Were it even admitted that the canal company had exceded the authority under which they are acting, nevertheless, as the Potomac river is a navigable stream, a part of the jus publicum, any obstruction to its navigation would, upon the most established principles, be what is declared by law to be a public nuisance. A public nuisance being the subject of criminal jurisdiction, the ordinary and regular proceeding at law is by indictment or information, by which the nuisance may be abated, and the person who caused it may be punished. If any particular individual may have sustained special damage from the erection of it, he may maintain a private action for such special damage, because to that extent he has suffered beyond his portion of injury in common with the community at large. Besides this remedy at law, it is now settled that a court of equity may take jurisdiction in cases of public nuisance, by an information filed by the attorney general. This jurisdiction seems to have been acted on with great caution and hesitancy. Thus, it is said by the Chancellor in 18 Vesey, 217, that the instances of the interposition of the court were confined and rare. He referred, as to the principal author- ity on the subject, to what had been done in the court of exchequer, upon the discussion of the right of the attorney general, by some species of informa- tion, to seek, on the equitable side of the court, relief as to nuisance and pre- ventive relief. Chancellor Kent, in 2 Johns., ch. 382, remarks that the equity &quot; &apos;22 Report of Railroad Commissioners. sioners, and illness on my part confining me to my house, some delay in acknowledging your esteemed favor of the 3d inst. has been necessary. While the prompt and courteous manner in which the officers of your com- pany have responded to our inquiries heretofore, and the informal assurances we have had from some of them have induced the belief that no refusal would be made to any reasonable request for information in the future, it will be to the Commissioners additional satisfaction to know that your denial of the validity of the law under which the Commission was organized, is mainly or wholly confined to those provisions which &quot;fix the compensation of railroad companies for the transportation of freight and passengers,” that you &quot;do not dispute the right to appoint Commissioners, and devolve upon them the duties usually appertaining to that office.&quot; It has been our purpose, in the fulfilment of our plan of conducting the work of the Commission, to supplement our study of the important general questions involved, and our inquires into the history of railway construction, legislation and management in this state, as derivable from public and pub- lished records, by a careful examination of the books and records of the several railway companies, and it will be a source of satisfaction that you have been pleased to anticipate our request, by politely inviting the Com- mission to make such investigation of the records of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad Company. Touching your allusion to &quot; a recent public address&quot; by His Excellency, Governor Taylor, in which he is reported to have made certain statements concerning the loss entailed by the Potter Law on the roads mentioned in class &quot;A,&quot; I am not able to speak advisedly, my illness having prevented the reading of the address at the time of its publication, and no copy of the same being now at hand. I may say, however, that from data contained in the published reports of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company, and data furnished upon request by the general freight agent of the company, the Commission have mathematically reached the conclusion that the difference between the receipts of that company on the freight business of 1873, had the same been done under the tariffs adopted by it last April, and the amount that would have been received on the same business had it been done under the pro- visions of chapter 273 of the laws of 1874, is less than five per cent., the cal- culation being confined to the business done within the state. You are perfectly right in assuming that the Commission have no other pur- pose than to deal justly and impartially with the important matters entrusted to them; and that they fully intend to make their official report as complete as possible, and trustworthy in every respect. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, Your obedient servant, JOHN W. HOYT, Railroad Commissioner. &apos; &quot;180 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

Sold at a dis- count, inflated, unlimited by law, and often misappropriated, its actual amount and value ultimately become subject to the discre- tion of the managing board. The bonded debt, subject to the same conditions and influences, is liable to the same possible dilu- tion and depreciation. Public consequences of insecurity for capital. This tendency to financial demoralization, wholly prejudicial to regular invest- vestment, is of startling import in all its history and possible con- sequences. One of the immediate results is the fact that the pub- lic is held responsible for the payment of interest on a vast capital, nominal and not actual, and rendered nominal, at least, in great part by means which no intelligent judgment can sanction or ap- prove. 5. That the necessity for control is a growing one. That the demand for a judicious control is a growing one, is ap- parent from the rapid development of our country, and the conse- quent need of increased facilities, duly guaranteed and protected. It is especially apparent in the case of the northwestern states, whose resources are so incalculable, and whose growth in popula- tion has been so unprecedented during the recent years. Here are millions of an industrious, energetic, and progressible people, gath- ered from all parts of the new and old world, for the very purpose of availing themselves of the extraordinary opportunities afforded by our fertile soils, our forests of timber and our rich and varied mineral resources. They came as to the garden-spot of the whole world, and they will make it a garden in fact, if their industry is properly encouraged. Transportation, easy, prompt and cheap, is a condition of the growth of this new empire of the northwest, which the economist cannot fail to recognize, and which legislatures cannot ignore. Somehow, it must be insured, or a nation&apos;s growth is retarded. REMAINING QUESTIONS THOSE OF KIND AND DEGREE. The first questions being fully settled, let us now consider the great questions of the present, namely: what should be the form and nature of the control to be exercised, and to what extent is it proper to carry it? These are in fact the questions which at this moment agitate the &quot; &apos;Executive and Legal Documents. 29 And the said Attorney General further, as aforesaid, gives said court to un- derstand and be informed, and states the fact to be that the said defendant on the first day of January, 1874, owned and operated about five hundred miles of railroad within the said state of Wisconsin, and ever since that time has used, operated and managed, now does use, operate and manage the same in the transportation of freights and passengers upon its said railroad. And the said Attorney General further, as aforesaid, gives the court to un- derstand and be informed, and shows now here that the legislature of Wis- consin, at its annual session in the year 1874, duly passed an act entitled “an act relating to railroads, express and telegraph companies in the state of Wis- consin,&quot; approved March 11, 1874, which said act was duly published on the twenty-eighth day of April, 1874, and took effect on said last mentioned day, and thence hitherto has been and still is in full force and operation. And the said Attorney General, further, as aforesaid, informs and gives the court to understand, and alleges that in and by the provisions of the said last named act, it is, among other things enacted that the railroads of the said state be, and are divided into classes, and that all freights to be transported upon said railroads, or any parts thereof, within the state of Wisconsin, after the passage of the said last mentioned act, be, and are classified, and the com- pensation to be charged and received by the companies owning, managing and operating said railroads for the transportation of freight and passengers over their respective roads, are fixed and limited as herein prescribed. And the Attorney General further, as aforesaid, informs the court, and shows that the said defendant, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Com- pany, instead, as he had well hoped and believed it would do, of conforming the use, operation and management of its said railroad within the limits and conditions, and according to the regulations and presentations of the last aforesaid act, and without attempting to exceed the powers granted to and conferred upon it by law, and particularly, without attempting to disregard the provisions and requirements of the last aforesaid act in the the transac- tion of its said business and in the operation of its said road, did immediately after the said act took effect, namely, on the 29th day of April, A. D. 1874, file in the office of the Governor of the state of Wisconsin, a communication in writing, signed by Albert Keep, President of the said railway company, in which, among other things, announced its intention to disregard the provis- ions and requirements of the said last mentioned act, being chapter 273 of the laws of 1874, so far as the same provides and fixes the rates of compensation for the transportation of freight and passengers within said state, and to man. age and operate its railroad to and from and between its various stations within said state regardless of the requirements of said act of the legislature and in defiance of law. And the said Attorney General further, as aforesaid, avers and gives the court to understand and be informed, that the said defendant, combining and confederating with divers persons, at present to the said Attorney General unknown, whose names when discovered, the said Attorney General prays, that he may be at liberty to insert herein, with apt and proper words, to charge them as parties defendant hereunto, and contriving how to wrong and injure the plaintiff and all the people of the state of Wisconsin in the pre- mises, has hitherto also lately refused, and still does so refuse, to comply with the requirements of the aforesaid act, and has adopted and issued a tariff of rates for freight between local stations within the said state, and a tariff of rates for freights and passengers transported over its roads within said state, and a classification of freights, each and all of which are in disregard of the class- ification and rates fixed by the said last mentioned act, and contrary to the re- quirements thereof. That said defendant has also issued to its officers, agents and servants (each and all of whom the plaintiff prays may, when their names shall be discovered, be made parties defendant to this action, with apt and proper words, to charge them) instructions to charge, demand and receive of all per- sons passing over their road or shipping freights thereon, the rates and com- pensation therefor, in the said tariff and schedules so issued by the said defendant, which said last mentioned rates and compensation are different from and higher, and greater than those fixed, limited and authorized by the said act, and in excess of the power and authority conferred upon the defendant by law, and that the said defendant, its agents, servants, officers &apos; &quot;Evils of Railway Construction and Management. 53 the same in the different cases. To point out that the roads of England, e. g., cost three-and-a-half times as much as the average for the United States, and five-and-a-half times as much as the average cost in this state, would prove nothing certainly, for there is, in this case very great difference in the necessary cost of con- struction. English railway engineers commenced their works in a most ex- pensive way; and they have not even yet learned the art of cheap building as it is everywhere understood in this country. They do not now build roads, as at first, wholly of iron and stone, with granite sills and cross-ties firmly established upon macadamized road-beds, deep enough to be secure from the action of frost, for the reason, that they were altogether too costly even for English capitalists, and yet not so good for use as those built of a more elastic material. They do, nevertheless, even now build much more substantially than we do with double track of the heaviest iron and steel; with broad road-beds of the best material; with stable bridges of iron and stone; with expensive crossings above or be- low the track. They equip them, moreover, with the best engines and rolling stock that can be built, and they supply their more nu- merous stations with permanent, and often elegant depots, freight and passenger houses affording ample facilities for every depart- ment of the business, and every needed comfort for travelers. And there, also, the right of way requires an enormous expenditure- sometimes more than it costs to construct and equip one of our roads. #1 1 There is still another reason why such comparisons are not alone conclusive, namely, that the English roads may also have cost more than was legitimate, as they probably did. It is only when one fairly considers all the conditions and circumstances of con- struction in any two or more cases compared, that a fair conclusion can be reached. If the circumstances are very nearly the same with two roads, and one is found to have cost $60,000 per mile and the other $35,000, the inference is legitimate that one has been more economically, perhaps more honestly built, than the other. Or, again, if one built through an old and hilly country, where expensive right of way, deep cuttings, heavy stone work and costly bridging are inevitable, is reported to have cost $30,000 per mile, while another, built over a level, open prairie, with neither cuts nor embankments, and little or nothing for right of way, has cost &quot; &quot;Remedial Measures. 117 road, speed of trains, distance of carriage, bulk of business, risks incurred and the earnings of return trains, all relate immediately to the question of cost. Some classes of freight must be trans- ported speedily, or its value is lost or depreciated. Other classes require special protection from the accidents of breakage, leakage or fire. Ou one road, freights can be carried with safety and rapid- ity, and all the equipment of the company is in constant use in both directions. On another road, the service is inadequate, or freight is taken at cheap rates in otherwise empty cars, or empty cars must be sent a long distance to transport freight one way only. The cost of transportation in winter is greater than in summer. During one year the avenues of commerce are poorly patronized, and the sources of trade inert, while in another year business activ- ity demands extraordinary expenditure of money and energy. These illustrations of varying cost according to varying cir- cumstances, might be extended profitably so as to include the rela- tions of various points of traffic to railway cost, including all the exigencies arising from competition with rival routes by rail and water. As a matter of fact, there are sections of railroad lines in this state which would become practically worthless were their managers denied the exercise of a la.ge degree of discretion in securing business. We argue from facts like these, that an exercise of the power of discrimination cannot be profitably measured and defined by a fixed rule of law. But we do not conclude, therefore, that manifest evils of discrimination cannot be materially mitigated, or even wholly abrogated, under the direction of public authority. Admit- ting the necessity of discrimination, we do not admit the necessity of unjust discrimination. Under precisely the same circumstances, all men are entitled to the same service for the same price, and vio、 lations of this general principle ought not to be tolerated or ex- cused. Doubtless many complaints of discrimination are without just foundation. Doubtless, also, many, if not most of the actual grievances suffered by community from selfish railway management might be averted through the informal intervention of intelligent public authority. Under all circumstances, the right of appeal, the influences of public opinion and the duty of arbitration, the last fortified with a limited but undoubted power of legal control, are important sources of public relief, if not of complete reform.

But we have to do here with the right under the franchise, not with a right which might have existed without the franchise. We have no doubt of the general authority of a state legislature to regulate the tolls of a corporation of this character, as a necessity of public welfare and public order, under the sovereign power of police, when the exercise of that power is not in some way suspended or restrained. But the right of the corporation here to take tolls at discretion, being thus fixed by express franchise in their charter, there seems to us to be no room for doubt that, viewing the charter as a contract, the franchise is a positive grant to take tolls in the manner and to the extent prescribed by it, subject to such judicial construction and control as it may bear; and is a vital part of the contract of the charter within the authorities. We are not considering the charter as a mere statute. We are considering it, in obedience to the Dartmouth College rule, as a contract. We are not giving our own views of its effect. We are looking at it in the mirage of Federal construction. Considering this matter of purely state law and state polity, we are sitting in vinculis, bound by an interpretation of the prohibi tion in the Federal Constitution, on a subject with no Federal relation, which we think it ought not to bear, and which, it is admitted, it was not in- tended to bear; but which, while it stands, emasculates state authority over state corporations. We are sitting on this question of state law and state polity, not so much as the supreme court of Wisconsin, as an inferior Fed- eral court. And we are bound, on this subject, to rule, not as we think, but as the Federal Supreme Court thinks. The adjudications of this court on state law and state policy, having no possible relation to Federal law or Fed- eral policy, have been frequently overruled by that court, without excuse found in the Federal constitution. We do not mean to give an opportunity now, with excuse. On this point, we admit and defer to their authority. It is an evil example, subversive of judicial order and judicial authority, not becoming judges or courts, to disregard the authority of courts within their peculiar and appropriate jurisdiction, whether it be of Federal by state courts, or of state courts by Federal. We do not propose to follow a bad example. And, in all questions under the Federal constitution, it is the duty and choice of this court to follow, as nearly as it can, the principles and spirit of the adjudications of the Federal Supreme Court. We think that the state ought to possess the same power over this, as over other railroads. And we think that the right of the state to control territorial charters, independently of the reserved power, ought to exist, as one well founded in principle. We are even inclined to think that the weight of state authority is in favor, rather than against it, even under the Darmouth Col- lege rule. We have considered, with great interest, an able and instructive note of Judge Redfield to the case of Philadelphia, W. &amp;amp; B. R. R. Co. v. Bowen, Am. Law Reg., March, 1874. We think, however, that the distinguished jurist had too little in his view the spirit and scope of the decisions of the supreme court of the United States, and that he shows rather what the law ought to be, and would be but for those decisions, than what it is under them. He seems to think that the Darmouth College rule is being pushed to such an extreme as will ultimately defeat it altogether, by a reductio ad absurdum. So many are beginning to think, and so we think. But we think that he errs in laying the blame on those who oppose the extent of the rule, which we think belongs to those who support it. But, after very deliberate consideration, we find that the principle and state authority leave us no room for doubt, that this case comes within the prohibition, under the decisions of the supreme court of the United States, We think that the rule to be gathered from all the decisions, and which should govern us, is accurately stated in Judge Cooley&apos;s excellent work, and we give it in his own words: &amp;quot;The limit to the exercise of the police powers in these cases must be this: the regulations must have reference to the comfort, welfare or safety of soci- ety; they must not be in conflict with any provision of the charter; and they must not, under pretence of regulation, take from the corporation any of the : &quot; &apos;Executive and Legal Documents. 55 than directory to the legislature, as it leaves the whole matter, after all, to its judgment.&quot; Clark v. Janesville, 10 Wis., 119. And, as a directory provision, it proved to be largely unavailing, as our statute books abundantly show. Therefore came the amendment of 1871, prohibiting special legislation in this and other cases This amendment prohibits the legislature from passing special laws, amongst other purposes, for granting corporate powers or privileges, except to cities; and directs that the legislature shall provide general laws for pur- poses for which special acts are so prohibited, which shall be uniform throughout the state. It was contended that this amendment, prohibiting the grant of corporate powers by special act, operates as a repeal of the reserved power of altering existing special charters by special acts; that the prohibtion to grant corporate powers includes, not only the creation of new corporations, but also the grant of new powers to existing corporations, and by inference the limitation or regulation of existing corporate powers, by special acts; and so confines the reserved power to alter special charters, to general laws. The difficulty of altering special charters by general laws, which shall be uniform throughout the state, is very apparent. And if this were the true construction of the amendment, it would almost follow that special charters could no longer be repealed by special acts, and that the whole reserved pow- er was relegated to general laws. It was even said by counsel that the char- ter of a corporation, organized under general law, could be repealed only by repeal of the general law; so that one corporation of one kind could not be subjected to repeal without repealing the charters of all corporations of the same kind under the same general law. This is almost an argument ad ab- surdum. And it is all a very inconvenient and, we may say, dangerous con- struction, which we should be very unwilling to adopt. We shall not stop to dwell here on the importance of the reserved power. We may do that later, in a more appropriate connection. We shall only as- sume here that it is a power of great significance and gravity; of such mo- ment, that it is impossible to believe that the legislature and the people in- tended to surrender or impair it; very hard to believe that they suffered themselves to surrender or impair it, by implication, in an amendment de- signed for quite a different purpose, quite consistent with the reserved power, But the purpose of the amendment, so far as it affects sec. 1, Art. XI, ap- pears to us very manifest. It was designed to act on the first clause only of the section, taking away the legislative discretion and changing the directory provision into a prohibitory one; and not to touch the second clause of the section at all, leaving the reserved power where it found it, to be exercised thereafter as theretofore, upon the special charters, by special acts. The amendment is prospective only, not retrospective. I prohibits an old way and provides a new way of creating corporations, but was not designed to affect existing corporations in any way. If it could operate to take away legislative control over existing charters, it might well be argued as it was in Indiana-that it operates to repeal them altogether. We can see nothing in the letter or spirit of the amendment to warrant us in giving it a construction to impair the reserved power. Under the rule of constructive repeal, we are bound to give such construction to these constitu- tional provisions as will leave both to stand together. It is not for us to wrest so great a power from the legislature, by construction, unless the legislature and the people have made such construction inevitable. And we feel bound to hold, and find no difficulty in holding, the phrase in the amendment, to grant corporate powers or privileges, to mean in principio donationis, and equivalent to the phrase, to grant corporate charters. This is implied not only by the word, grant, but also by the word, corporate. A franchise is not essentially corporate; and it is not the grant of franchise which is prohibit- ed, but of corporate franchise; that is, as we understand it, franchise by act of incorporation. There are cases in Iowa with some bearing on this question, which were not cited, but which we have carefully considered. The constitution of that state of 1857, Art. III, sec. 30, prohibits local or especial laws in certain cases; among these, for the incorporation of cities or &apos; &quot;18 Report of Railroad Commissioners. start. It would require a good sized commercial college force to do the work, and would beat me out of a season&apos;s vacation. I beg leave to offer you the following as approximating to some of the in- formation asked for. On the 19th of March last I furnished the General Manager with the fol- lowing statement: 66 &apos;By actual calculation the loss to this company by the Potter Law, as compared with present tariffs rates, would be on the business of 1873, as fol- lows: On grain, flour and live stock Eestimated loss on lumber, agricultura implements, and other car-load freight in the special classes. $200, 152 00 71,000 00 $271,152 00 Signed, O. E. BRITT, Gen&apos;l Ft. Agt. On the 27th of April we issued new freight tariffs for the state, which would reduce the earnings on our volume of business equal to that of 1873, at least $50,000. Applying the legal or Potter Law rates with this tariff now in force, to the same volume of business, would involve a further loss of over $220,000. I do not see with the material I have at hand how I can do more for you. Respectually yours, O. E. BRITT, Gen&apos;l Ft. Agt. CHICAGO, July 25, 1874. DEAR SIR: I have your letter of the 21st inst., requesting me to furnish you with the tonnage and earnings on special classes enumerated in the so called Potter Law, transported within the state of Wisconsin during the year 1873. Our statistics do not show the amount of specials transported, nor the earnings on the same, within the state, separately, and to make up the state- ment as you request, would involve the examination of over 500,000 way- bills, with a mathematical and mileage calculation on each class of goods in each of the said way bills. This would take an army of clerks many months and at a cost of not less than $25,000. To keep the statistics in a way to answer your questions, would be about as practicable on a railroad, as it would be for the cashier of a large city bank to keep a record of the number, date and signature on each bank note passing through his hands every day. From my experience of our business, it is my judgment that the amount of earnings affected by the Potter Law on special classes, would not be less than two million dollars ($2,000,000), and the reduction from the present tariff by conforming to it, would be at least 25 per cent., or a loss of over $500,000.

THE TEACHINGS OF ALL PAST EXPERIENCE. From this survey of the past, the following general conclusions. are unavoidable: 1. That the public character of railways is fully established. One form of argument in high quarters against the exercise of public supervision, is embraced in the proposition that corporations have transportation to sell, and that the purchase of the article or privilege so offered for sale, like that of all other commodities in market, is at the option of the purchaser. But the condition of sale in this case, come under none of the ordinary conditions of human traffic. The original right to construct and operate rail- ways is an emanation of sovereignty, grounded on public consider- ations, and having explicit reference to public as well as to private use and profit. The question of power is already substantially and fortunately settled as to our own state. The subsidiary question of the necessity and propriety of judiciously exercising that power when possessed, is equally settled in the opinion of the whole civ- ilized world. We know of no government in Europe which has not already exercised this power—not with reference to the special ends of arbitrary government, but with the purpose of defending the people from the encroachments of consolidated wealth, mani- fest in the form of corporate monopoly. 2. That the consequent right, and the necessity of control are no- where in doubt. It appears that the right of the state to exercise supervision over railway corporations has been recognized wherever the subject has received mature consideration-that it has been asserted by cham- bers and parliaments in all the countries of Europe, as well as by the legislatures of this country, and that it has been sustained and confirmed by the highest courts. Such conclusions are unavoidable, having their foundation in the common law and in the very nature and relations of society. 3. That control is demanded by the public interests. This proposition is now so well established, that there can be none to dispute it. The people have rights which inhere in the &quot; &quot;Official Papers and Correspondence. 25 COMPARATIVE ACCOUNTS.

Chap. 28, Laws of 1852, amends section twenty-four of chap. 176, laws of 1851, by authorizing the Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad Company to extend its road from the village of Watertown in Jefferson county, by way of the village of Columbus and Portage City in Columbia county, to Prairie La Crosse in the county of La Crosse, and to increase its capital stock to $1,500,- 000, whenever such extension was decided on. Act approved Feb. 13, 1852. Chap. 123, Laws of 1853, authorizes the city of Watertown to extend aid to the Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad by a loan of its credit in the sum of $80,000, upon a majority vote of the people in favor of such proposition, and to take security by a bond and mortgage from the company in twice the amount, for the punctual payment of both interest and principal; issues of bonds to be made the company as the building of the road progressed on its way westward from its junction with the Milwaukee and Mississippi Rail- road.

Besides, a suit by the individual to enforce the common law liability settles nothing. No general rule can be established in a single suit, while such a suit would involve an inquiry and determination of the cost of the road and its equipment, the operating expenses, the amount and character of the busi- ness, and the whole detail of the condition, management and relative cost of everything connected with the road. When this is done the reasonableness of the charge in every other instance remains open to be litigated at such an expenditure of time and money as to deter individuals from entering such a field of hopeless litigation. I am led to the conclusion that the better view is, that the judgment of the legislature is by the reservation of power, and the necessities of the case, the measure of the reasonableness of the regulation imposed. The corporation certainly cannot arbitrarily determine the question, and on the assumption that the rates are unreasonable disregard the law. The legislative act is con- clusive that the rate is reasonable. The exercise of the power is of itself an assertion of its justice and of its necessity. The railroads cannot question it; the courts may not review it, for by the agreement of the parties in accept- ing the charters under the reservation, the whole subject is withdrawn from the domain of judicial decision and remains only a matter for the legislative conscience. And so with the objection that the provisions of this law assume control of the property of the corporation, and deprives them of its use without mak- ing any compensaiion, and is, therefore, in conflict with the constitution of the state and of the United States. As these corporations have no natural existence, but are created wholly by legislative enactments, their power to act, in every particular, is derived from the state; their capacity to make contracts, acquire and use property, and to charge for its use comes from the state, and is granted on such terms and to such extent as the legislature may prescribe; the power of the state to grant is given by the constitution and coupled with this power is found in the same fundamental law, the authority to alter the act of incorporation as the legis- lature may think the public interests demand. The rights and privileges conferred cannot be separated from the restrictions and duties imposed. The power to take toll cannot be distinguished from the duty to take only such as the legislature shall establish. It is difficult to see how restricting these tolls within certain limits which the legislature deems just, is any more de- priving the corporations of their property than it would be to repeal their charters and thus deprive them of the power of charging any rates at all, and this latter power may confessedly be exercised without making compensation. Whether the state can compel the companies to operate their roads for such compensation as it chooses to prescribe, is another and different question, not involved in this discussion. The only inquiry, while companies are violat- ing the law by charging higher rates than it allows is, as to the power of the legislature to prohibit them from charging above certain fixed rates. If it shall be made to appear that the companies cannot operate their roads except at a loss under the rates fixed by the law, the remedy is not in an atti- tude of open hostility to the law, but in an application to the legislattre for its modification. As suggested in relation to the other objection, this is the forum which the constitution has provided for the determination of that ques- tion, and in accepting the charters, the companies assented to be governed and bound by the legislative sense of justice. This sense of justice will un- doubtedly coincide with the mutual interest of the people and of the rail- road companies. These interests demand, with a force almost equal to the provisions of positive law, that remunerative rates shall be allowed for the services of these corporations; but as a mere question of legal right, full power has been reserved by the constitution, in the language of Olcott v. Super- visors, supra, to alter or repeal the charters of these corporations, and the roads can therefore be controlled and regulated by the state; their use can be defined and their tolls and rates for transportation limited. But it is also claimed that the reserved power to interfere is confined to contracts made by the state with the corporation, and can have no applica- tion to such as are made by the companies with bona fide creditors. The latter are said to be within the protection of the constitution of the United &quot; &apos;104 Appendix. laws for the government and management of the corporation, or its officers, not contrary to the laws of Wisconsin or of the United States.

LETTER OF ALEXANDER MITCHELL, President Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company. TO THE GOVERNOR. MILWAUKEE, April 28, 1874. His Excellency, WILLIAM R. TAYLOR, Governor of Wisconsin: DEAR SIR: At the last session of the legislature an act was passed entitled &quot;an act relating to railroads, express and telegraph companies in the state of Wisconsin,&quot; which assumes, among other things, to fix the tariff for freight and passengers, which the railroads of the state may hereafter charge. This act arbitrarily divides the railroads of the state into different classes, and then declares that one class shall charge one rate, another a different rate, and a third class still another rate of compensation for performing the same or similar services, and affixes severe penalties for a violation of its provisions. You are aware that this species of legislation is entirely new in this state, and in the broad and sweeping terms of this act, is practically unknown to any of the states of the Union. The right of a company owning a road to fix its rate or charges was recently held in the supreme court of the United States to be &quot;an attribute of ownership.&quot; Yet this law wholly ignores that right, and not only deprives the owner of property of the right to fix the compensa- tion to be paid for its use, but arbitrarily fixes one price for one and a differ- ent one for another, without any inquiry as to whether the price fixed &quot;is a reasonable one, or will afford a fair and adequate remuneration and return upon the amount of capital invested.&quot; The obligation and promise which Chief Justice Dixon says, &quot;spring from the act of incorporation and invita- tion by the state to persons to invest their money in the stock&quot; of railroad companies, that they shall receive a fair and reasonable compensation for the money expended, is wholly disregarded. The roads now owned and operated by the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company were all built under charters which provided that &quot;the board of directors should have the right and power to regulate their tolls,&quot; ,&quot; and that the company should have the right to demand and receive such sum or sums of money for freight of persons and property as they should from time to time think reasonable. On this solemn faith and pledge these roads were built, and their right to a fair and reasonable return for the capi- tal invested became settled and fixed, beyond the power of the legislature to abrogate or destroy. These roads are property created under the sanction of law, and are owned by the company. To arbitrarily deprive the company of them or their beneficial use, by act of the legislature, is depriving the com- pany of its property without due process of law. It is confiscation. If it is claimed that the public interests demand this action, on the part of the state, then, I submit, it is taking the property for public use, and that just com- pensation must be made. The present company has succeeded to all the 1-R. R.-App. &apos; &quot;RECORDS OF RAILWAY COMPANIES. ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION. ORGANIZATION OF CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN R. R.

Lanier, trustee under the other mortgage or deed of trust com- monly known as the land grant mortgage of the said company; and WHEREAS, The said purchasers desire to form a corporation under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Wisconsin, as well as of the laws of the states of Illinois and Michigan. Now, therefore, in conformity to the provisions of an act to facilties and authenticate the formation of a corporation by the purchase of the Chicago, St. Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad Company, approved March 14, 1859, and the laws of the said state of Wisconsin, and to an act of the state of Illinois, entitled an act to authorize the sale of the Chicago, St. Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad, and to enable the purchasers thereof to form a corporation, approved February 19, 1859, and to the laws of the said state of Illinois, We James I. Gilden and Ossian D. Ashley, purchasers as aforesaid, do hereby certify and declare: 1st. The corporate name of the said corporation shall be Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company. 2d. The number of the directors shall be thirteen, until the number thereof shall be otherwise fixed by a by-law adopted at a meeting of stockholders duly held, and thereafter the number shall be as the by-laws of the said com- pany, for the time being, shall prescribe. 3d. The directors of the said company for the first year will be William B. Ogden, Perry H. Smith, E. W. Hutchings, George M. Bartholomew, Charles Butler, Thomas H. Perkins, Mahlon D. Ogden. Alexander C. Coventry, Henry Smith, James R. Young, John J. R. Pease, M. C. Darling, and Albert Wins- low, who are hereby declared to be elected and appointed as such directors. In witness whereof, we, the said purchasers, have hereunto set our hands and seal, this sixth day of June, 1859. Signed, sealed and delivered in presence of W. T. PELTON, SAMUEL I. TILDEN, HENRY E. HAYDEN, O. D. ASHLEY. &quot; &quot;138 Report of Railroad Commissioners. leaving the application and enforcement of those rules to a commis- sion. A judicious application of this method requires- 1. A determination, by the commissioners, of the actual cash value of each railroad; such value not to be greater than the actual cost thereof, and the valuation subject to legislative revision. 2. An annual determination of the gross and net earnings of each company, from the reports of companies, by actual inspection of books and affairs, and by all other practicable methods. 3. A division of roads into two classes: the first class including all roads paying a reasonable compensation on valuation, and the second class including all other roads. 4. A maximum of rates of fare and freight for roads ascertained to belong to the first class; such maximum being subject to legis- lative revision. 5. No restriction of earnings upon roads of second class, except by way of remedying unjust discriminations. 6. A prohibition of unjust discriminations and unreasonable or excessive rates on all roads; any person complaining of discrimi- nation or extortionate charges having the right of appeal to the board of commissioners, under such rules as to evidence of facts as the commissioners may determine; the board determining the fact of discrimination on evidence and notice to both sides, and its conclusions to be prima facie evidence as to fact of discrimi- nation, or of unreasonable charges. 7. Additional police regulations, especially as to running con- nections, and the passage of freight from one road to another. 8. Limited power of the commissioners to require repair of roads, improvement of roads or rolling stock, and increased ac- commodations for passenger travel. 9. Full and complete publicity of rates of fare and freight. 10. Publicity of all important contracts and agreements between railway companies, and of their business transactions generally. 11. Greater uniformity and completeness of accounts, as well as greater fullness and frequency of reports. &quot; &apos;66 Appendix. such theories. The interest of the public, in this regard, seems to be identi- cal with the interest of the railroads. We think that there must be a point. where the public interest in railroads and the private interest of the corpora- tors meet; where the service of the public at the lowest practicable rate, will produce the largest legitimate income to the railroads. It seems to us an utter delusion that the highest tolls will produce the largest income. The companies have hitherto absolutely controlled their own rates. The legisla- ture now limits them. The companies say that the limit is too low. But there is no occasion for heat or passion on either side. The people and the legislature understand well the necessity of the railroads to the state, and the necessity of dealing fairly and justly, and even liberally, with the companies. Time and prudence and wise counsels will set all this right. This very con- troversy may well bring about a better and more permanent understanding and relation between the state and its corporations. We say so much in def- erence to an earnest appeal from the bar to counsel moderation. But, in the meantime, we cannot legislate for either party. We can only say what the law is, and administer it as we find it. An objection was taken to chapter 273, that it is not uniform throughout the state, as required of general laws under the constitutional amendment of 1871. As we think that we have already sufficiently indicated, we sustain and apply this act as an alteration of the special charters of these defend- ants, and not as an amendment of the general railroad act of 1872. It was said, on the argument, that one of the roads of the Chicago and Northwest- ern Company was organized under the general act. But that is not pleaded, and does not appear in any of the papers in the case; and of course we can- not act upon a mere verbal suggestion of the kind. So the question whether chapter 273 can be held a valid alteration of the general railroad act of 1872, is not before us, and is not passed upon. Neither do we express any opinion on the validity of any provision of chapter 273, not expressly involved in the decisions of these motions. And, in that connection, it is proper to say that the injunctions prayed for exclude all questions here on what is called inter-state commerce. We only hold the provisions of chapter 273 of 1874, regulating their tolls, to be valid amendments of the special charters of these defendants, obtained from the state under the constitution, as it stood before the amendment of 1871. VI. Supposing chapter 273 to be, on the part of the state, a valid amend- ment of the charters of the defendants, it was objected that it could not be a valid amendment quoad the defendants, without acceptance of it on their part; and until such acceptance, not obligatory upon them. And this prop- osition is sanctioned by Yeaton v. Bank, 21 Grattan, 593, and other cases cited. It was said in Kenosha R. R. Co. v. Marsh, supra, and we think said-cer- tainly implied-in other cases in this court, that valid alterations of a charter under the reserved power, would bind the corporation, whether assented to or not. The same thing has been said by other courts, is implied in a great many cases, and is expressly decided by the supreme court of Massachusetts in Mayor v. Norwich &amp;amp; W. R. R. Co., supra. And we think that the better opinion. But it appears to us to be here a distinction without a difference. For it is very evident, as it is said in Yeaton v. Bank, that if the corporation do not accept the amendment, it must abandon its charter. The court says: &quot;One consequence undoubtedly is, that the corporation cannot conduct its opera- tions in defiance of the power that created it; and if it does not accept the modification or amendment proposed, must discontinue its operations as a corporate body.&quot;. If the amendment be obligatory, the corporation may suspend; if it be not obligatory, the corporatinon must accept or suspend; we fail to see the practi- cal difference in such a case as this. Whether or not the defendants had an election to accept or reject, and whether or not they accepted the amend- ment, they had no right to go on in disregard of the amendment. And we think that their proceeding under their charters, after the passage of the alter- ation, raises a presumption that, if they had a right of election, they exer- &apos; &quot;24 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

The &amp;quot;Mc- Gregor Western Railway,&amp;quot; embracing the whole line of the present Iowa and Minnesota division of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Com- pany, was sold to the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company, August 5, 1867; (for terms of this sale, see Appendix, p. 115.) That portion of the Minnesota Cen- tral Railway, from Austin, southerly to the state line, to a point of connection with the Cedar Falls and Minnesota Railway Company, a distance of 11 miles, was sold to the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, February 15, 1870. (For terms of this sale, see Appendix, p. 116.) LA CROSSE AND MILWAUKEE. Books of subscription to the capital stock of this company were opened June 24, 1852, under an act of the legislature approved the 2d day of the pre- ceding April. Directors were elected August 3, 1852, and the organization was completed by the election of officers the 20th day of the ensuing August. At the close of the year conditional and unconditional subscriptions to stock had been received to the amount of $280,000. Survey of the eastern division, from Milwaukee to Portage City, was commenced September 15, 1852. The maximum ascending grade westward, by the route finally adopted, was re- ported to be 30 feet per mile, and the maximum grade eastward, 20 feet. The estimate of the cost of a first class freight and passenger road to Portage City, 98 miles, was reported to the board at $1,525,558.65, or $15,566.93 per mile. Survey of the western division, from Portage City to La Crosse, was commenced October 27, 1852. It was estimated that no ascending grade would exceed 30 feet to the mile, and that the entire cost of the western di- vision, including equipment, buildings and depot grounds, would not exceed $1,474,760.15, or $14,180.39 per mile. July 4, 1853, the company contracted for grading and grubbing, for build- ing culverts, bridges, road and farm crossings and cattle-guards, for cross-ties and laying the track from a point 18 miles from Milwaukee to Portage City, for $7,000 per mile, one-quarter payable in stock, and three-quarters in cash. At the close of the year 1853, the engineer estimated the cost of the road, on the basis of contracts and &apos;expenditures to that time, as follows: Eastern division, 94.40 miles, $2,065,000, or $21,875 per mile; western division, 103.60 miles, $2,206,162, or $21,295 per mile. The resources of the road at that date were reported as follows: Capital stock subscriptions, $1,200,000; Milwaukee city bonds, $200,000; capital stock to be applied towards road construction, $600,000; first mortgage bonds, $1,810,000; notes, other obligations and cash, $33,818.60. Total resources, $3,843,818.60. A large proportion of the stock subscriptions consisted of stock subscription. March 11, 1854, the La Crosse and Milwaukee company consolidated with the Milwaukee, Fond du Lac and Green Bay Railroad Company; the La Crosse and Milwaukee Company, under its original title subsequently representing and embracing the interests of both companies. The united cap- ital stock amounted to $6,800,000. The full paid shares brought in by the Milwaukee, Fond du Lac and Green Bay Company amounted to $114,500 &quot; &apos;106 Report of Railroad Comwiissioners. only be determined with great care, and upon a correct basis. A few words on both these points; and first of the basis: Rates not determinable on the basis of actual cost.-Before dismissing this branch of the subject, permit us to call your atten- tion to the fact that no experience, either in Europe or in this country, has demonstrated the utility of attempts to determine the actual value of railroad property upon the basis of actual cash expenditure in the course of construction. In addition to the diffi- culties attending the question, already enumerated, it must be re- membered that no railroad, especially in the United States, is ever fully and perfectly completed; that under the present financial sys- tem of railway management, no capital account is finally closed. The rolling stock and bed of every railroad, however apparently complete in its original character, demands and receives continuous additions and improvements. This is a law of railroad enterprise as inexorable as the immutable law of progress. The safety of hu- man life and every public interest demand a recognition of this law, and a continuous increase of total investment from the begin- ning—the new taking the place of the old, multiplying the capital account and enhancing the value of the resulting product. A com- parison of the present condition of any of the older lines of railway in Wisconsin with their condition at the date of their completion, or of any old line with any old line of road recently constructed, will illustrate this principle of inevitable and legitimate progress in cost. Again, the question presents itself, is actual cost in this case, or in any case, the just measure of value, and the appropriate basis of restrictive legislation? Governments do not tax property upon the basis of actual cost, but rather upon that of existing money value. The courts deal with property-including railroad property-upon a similar princi- ple, ignoring actual cost. Every individual estimates his property, also, in accordance with its marketable value. The question has been raised, whether there is any sufficiently good reason for a change of the universal rule in the case of rail- road property. One railway company constructs its road by extravagant expenditure, while another company proceeds eco- nomically. The rule of the existing law in such a case necessarily rewards the one company for the vice of prodigality and punishes the other for the virtue of wisdom and prudence. It is not denied that a railway company is the absolute owner of the visible &quot; &apos; &quot;52 Report of Railroad Commissioners. ed to consolidation by a constant law of self-interest which the public have regarded with hostility and distrust. The result must and should be an appreciation of the fact that the true interest of the public, as well as of the corporations, lies in the direction of better organized and less discordant expenditure of energy and capital, and in the adoption of more comprehensive principles of legislation to that end. The facts ought to be realized not only that discriminations by exorbitant charges upon one locality at the expense of another, is an evil to be discouraged, but also t&apos; at legislation discouraging investment by encouraging ruinous compe- tition is equally to be deplored. UNDUE COST OF CONSTRUCTION. Prominent among these evils is the primary one of unwarrantable cost. A road having been built as economically as possible, no one can reasonably make complaint of charges that yield only a mod- erate per cent. of profit on the investment. Indeed, the public are willing that they who put their money into railways should bave a very liberal profit; since, while such use of money is of great importance to the public-is indispensable to the growth and prosperity of a country-it is attended with more risk than is the investment of money in many other ways. But if a road has cost thousands of dollars per mile more than it ought, owing to want of skill and judgment on the part of the company, or if there is rea- son to believe that the assumed cost is not the real cost-the differ- ence having gone into the hands of officers or their friends acting in the capacity of contractors or &amp;quot;promoters &amp;quot;-then it is natural that there should be an unwillingness to allow even a moderate per cent. on the declared cost. Unfortunately, these mere hints of dishonest management find warrant in actual facts in all countries. The impression widely prevails, that the railway companies of the United States have pre-eminently distinguished themselves in the practice of such frauds. Upon the justice of this sweeping charge the comparative statistics, showing the mileage and cost of the railways of the world (see page 229) will throw at least a shadow of doubt. Still, it is no complete acquittal of the railway companies of this country to show that their roads have cost far less than the roads of another country; since the conditions of road-building are never &quot; &apos;Railway Statistics. 187 having practical experience in the construction of the road or branches de- scribed.&quot; In order that your requirements might be fully and satisfactorily answered, this company concluded, instead of having such estimates made by any of its officers, to appoint three civil engineers of acknowledged capacity and ability, well known throughout the state, and of unquestioned integrity and honesty, to make and prepare such estimates. The parties so selected were, Benjamin H. Edgerton, Wm. R. Sill and J. T. Dodge. These gentlemen have each an experience of over twenty years as civil engineers, and it would be difficult to select any three engineers in the northwest of greater experience in the construction of railroads, and none of equal experience in building such roads in this state. Not only so, but they were all engaged in construct- ing the roads of this company in this state, and, as engineers, had the actual charge and control of building the greater portion of them, and of their sub- sequent operation for several years. None of the gentlemen are now in the employ of this company, and two of them have not been for several years past. In addition to their knowledge of the construction and operation while employed thereon as above stated, they have, since their appoint- ment, made a thorough examination of the property, and, as they say in their report,&quot; an inspection of nearly every building on all your lines.&quot; We are therefore confident that their report is correct, and their estimate of the present actual value of the property of the company in this state, entitled to credit, on the basis on which it is made, and we adopt it as a correct esti- mate on the basis assumed by them, as appears from this report. Permit us, however to state, that no road was ever constructed, in the north- west, at least, if anywhere, on the financial basis there assumed. Their as- assumption is, that the company, on the 1st day of January, 1872, had at their command, on call, $28,850,820, which they were to proceed to expend in the most advantageous and judicious manner in constructing a road, and that if it had all been so expended during the years 1872 and 1873, it would have been sufficient to have constructed a road equal to the road of this company in this state. It is not necessary to inform you that no such happy financial condition ever belonged to any Wisconsin railway company, at any stage of its exist- ence; much less at its inception or during the progress of its construction, and we do not believe that any railroad in this country ever enjoyed any such state of felicity financially. On the contrary, it is well known that all roads in this state and in the northwest generally have been built from a treasury substantially empty of money, and supplied only with stock and bonds, and, as has been too often the case, these, even, hypothecated to secure the individ. ual note or endorsement of the directors given in payment for iron rails or other materials necessary in the construction of the road. It is a part of the history of our state, that the roads we have, were con- structed in this manner and with such means only, and except in this way, roads here have not been built. Our experience in this regard is not different from our sister states. Our &apos; &quot;Executive and Legal Documents. 57 is but the first link of a long chain of repetitions; ever subsequent interfer- ence being naturally produced by the effects of the prceeding. They very rightly infer, therefore, that some thorough reform is waiting, which will banish speculations in public measures, and inspire a general prudence and industry, and give a regular course to the business of society.&amp;quot; If this be, as may be safely inferred, the sense in which the prohibition was adopted, it is very certain that its framers did not foresee or intend the uses to which it has been put. So, indeed, Chief Justice Marshall himself admits, in his opinion, in the leading case. 4 Wheaton, 644. As early as 1810, the supreme court of the United States held that an act of a state legislature might be a contract within the meaning of the prohibi- tion, and, therefore, beyond subsequent legislative control. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87. In 1819, the same great tribunal held that the charter of any corporation, not municipal, was a contract within the prohibition, which the legislature could not impair, by subsequent amendment, against the will of the corpora- tion. Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheaton, 518. And that remains the law of the land to this day. It is easy to criticise the decision; to say that the very point was not in the case; to impeach the reasoning of the opinions. Many able jurists and statesmen have done so and are doing so. It is easy to foretell that the case will be opened. Many do so. Here is one of the latest and most thoughtful of such speculations: &amp;quot;Some of those who think it would have been better, had the case been de- cided the other way, may reasonably condemn any attempt to unsettle a branch of the law so long established. But the murmuring at the whole doc- trine, which is beginning to be heard throughout the country; the restless, fitful desire to get rid of it, not yet fully understood by themselves, which large classes of people begin to feel, indicates that the whole subject must, at no distant day, be carefully re-examined. Any decision in an ordinary case, ought, as a rule, to stand; and when a decision has stood for fifty years, even to question it lightly and without sufficient consideration, is injurious and censurable, as tending to unsettle an entire system of jurisprudence. But constitutional decisions which take from the political department of govern- ment powers and prerogatives usually belonging to it, and which legislation cannot remedy, stand on a different footing from ordinary precedents in- volving questions of private rights. Fifty years is a short period in the his- tory of a nation living under a constitution intended to be perpetual. The consequences of the Dartmouth College case are now beginning to press heavily on great communities, and the pressure, we believe, will increase rather than diminish. It involves questions of political power, political ne- nessity, it may yet be of political safety, and the case will not be let alone, however wise it might be to do so.&amp;quot; 8 American Law Review, 191. The court was not unanimous in the Dartmouth College case, and has not always been unanimous in subsequent cases applying the rule. Indeed it is a constant tradition of the profession that the Bench has never since been unanimous on the full extent of the doctrine of that case. The spirit of the decision and the grounds on which it goes, are best found in the opinions of the judges who made it. Chief Justice Marshall says: &amp;quot;It has been argued that the word &apos;con- tract&apos; in its broadest sense, would comprehend the political relations between the government and its citizens, would extend to offices held within a state for state purposes, and to many of these laws concerning civil institutions, which must change with circumstances, and be modified by ordinary legisla tion, which deeply concern the public, and which to preserve good govern- ment, the public judgment must control.&apos; That the clause in the constitu- tion, if construed in its greatest latitude, would prohibit these laws. Taken in its broad unlimited sense, the clause would be an unprofitable and vexa- tious interference with the internal concerns of a state, would unnecessarily and unwisely embarrass its legislation, and render immutable those civil in- stitutions, which are established for the purpose of internal government, and which, to subserve those purposes, ought to vary with varying circumstances. That as the framers of the constitution could never have intended to insert in that instrument a provision so unnecessary, so mischievous and so repug- &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 141 Amount of Debt.

This law went into effect in July, 1871. It was disregarded by the railroad corporations very generally, and various suits resulted. Finally the law came before the Supreme Court in a case of appeal, and was pronounced invalid; Chief Justice Lawrence delivering the opinion of the court. The suit was brought by the railroad commissioners against the Chicago and Alton Railroad Company on the charge of a violation of the provisions of the law against discriminations, and the decis- ion of the court was based on the ground that the law made no proper distinction between just and unjust discriminations, as will appear from the following quotation from the published opinion: &amp;quot;The opinion of the court is, that while the legislature has an unquestion- able power to prohibit unjust discrimination in railway freights, no prosecu- tion can be maintained under the existing law until amended, because it does not prohibit unjust discrimination merely, but discrimination of any char- &quot; &apos;Table of Contents.

The first question to be settled, and the one which has given us the great- est difficulty to settle, is the jurisdiction of this court to entertain the inform- ation in these causes. Since the case of Attorney General v. Blossom, 1 Wis., 317, the original juris- diction of this court, under the third clause of sec. 3, Art. VII of the consti- tution of this state, has never been doubted in this court, has been recognized and asserted in many cases, and is no longer an open question. This original jurisdiction is conferred and limited by the power &quot;to issue writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, injunction, quo warranto, and certioari, and other orig- inal and remedial writs, and to hear and determine the same.&quot; The court has many times exercised original jurisdiction in cases of habeas corpus, mandamus, quo warranto and certiorari. This is the first time it has been called upon to assert original jurisdiction of injunction. In the case of Cooper v. Mineral Point, MS., January T., 1874, application was made to this court to issue a writ of injunction in a cause pending in the circuit court. The court disclaimed jurisdiction to grant the writ in a cause not in this court, under either its appellate or original jurisdiction; but took occasion to assert its jurisdiction to issue the writ in a proper case com- menced in this court, as an exercise of its original jurisdiction. But in neither of these cases, nor-so far as we are aware-in any other case, has it been considered what are the nature and limits of the original jurisdiction conferred on this court in cases of injunction, or how is that jurisdiction to be exercised. And indeed the distinction between the writ of injunction and the other writs granted, seems to have been overlooked in discussions which had relation chiefly to the nature and functions of those other writs. In Attorney-General v. Blossom, Smith, J., speaking of the group of writs given to the court, says that &quot;this class of writs, it would seem, appertain to, and are peculiarly the instruments of, the soverign power, acting through its appropriate department: prerogatives of sovereignty, etc.” He calls them indiscriminately original and prerogative writs; and says that they &quot;differ essentially, in their character and objects, from ordinary writs issued by the courts, in the regular and usual administration of the law between parties. They go to accomplish peculiar and specific objects, carrying with them the special mandate of the sovereign power, etc. They bear no resemblance to the usual processes of courts by which controversies between private parties are settled by the judicial tribunals of every grade.&quot; He speakes particu- larly of the writs of certiorari and injunction as &quot;remedial writs of a high judicial character, and essential to the complete exercise of the function of Soverignty in the administration of justice.&quot; Substantially correct of all the other writs named, this language does not appear to be accurately used of the writ of injunction. At common law all the other writs given were prerogative writs, issuing on behalf of the state only; and though sometimes used for private remedy, were so used on spec- ial leave given, and in the name of the state, and were not ordinary writs applicable to private controversies, or issuable of course. All the other writs must or might be original; as given to this court they must be original writs- in the modern and practical sense of the term, original writs. The writ of injunction was not original. They are, as given, essentially jurisdictional writs, implying the jurisdiction granted, in each case, ex vi temini. The writ of injunction was not an original writ, and by itself, as given, implies no specific jurisdiction. It was a judicial writ, going only upon some judg- ment interlocutory or final, of the court issuing it, in some case of which the court had jurisdiction otherwise; never jurisdictional, but always remedial in aid of jurisdiction already attached, within the vast range of equitable cognizance. And the difficulty arises wholly from placing this non-jurisdic- tional writ in a group of jurisdictional writs, this judicial writ amongst original writs; this equitable writ of vague and varied application amongst common law writs of sharp and terse significance; this confusion of equita- ble and legal jurisdiction. In Attorney-General v. Blossom, the jurisdiction question was quo warranto. And elaborately as the question was discussed by the able judge who wrote the opinion, he seems to have followed the fra- mers of the constitution in a want of preception that the writ of injunction appeared to be illy grouped with habeas corpus, mandamus, quo warranto and certiorari, and that the court might be troubled some day, as it has been now, &apos; &quot;274 Report of Railroad Commissoners.

The law provides for the manner of computing distances where freight passes over more than one road, and inferentially, also, for car- rying at the maximum charges for the whole distance. The law seems to make provision for each road separately, leaving the ad- justment of compensation, as heretofore existing, between connecting compa- nies, to themselves; defining only the conditions between each separate com- pany and the public, and fixing the limitation of the charges. We are led to the conclusion that although no part of the law provides di- rectly that the companies shall pro rate one with another, yet it would seem that an absolute necessity for adjustment between them would arise, both as to compensation for carriage, as well as equipment, or else they would be constrained to refuse freights for destinations beyond the limits of their own lines and stations. The Commissioners fully reciprocate your desire for a judicious and mutu- ally satisfactory settlement of all questions arising from imperfections that may be found in the law, as well as of the main controversy between the rail- road corporations and the public, and will be pleased to receive you in their office for the discussion of different points, and to answer your inqui- ries in so far as they may be able to do so.

And your petitioner further shows, that the classification rates and compen sation so adopted by said company are different and higher and greater than those fixed and authorized by said chapter 273, and are in no respect in con- formity therewith, but are unjust and unreasonable and oppressive. And your petitioner further shows on information and belief, and so charges the fact to be, that the said Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Com- pany has ever since the 29th day of April, 1874, used and operated its rail- road within the state of Wisconsin, in entire disregard of the provisions of said chapter 273, and is daily and habitually charging and receiving greater and higher rates and compensation for the transportation of freights and passengers upon their said road, within this state, than are fixed, established and allowed by said chapter 273, and that said rates and compensations are so charged and received by said railroad company as aforesaid for carrying freight, which does not come from beyond the boundaries of the state or to be carried across or through the same. And your petitioner, further shows that on the 12th day of May, 1874, the said railroad company charged and received of one David Stephens, of the city of Madison, the sum of eighteen dollars for carrying and transporting 5,000 brick from the city of Watertown to the city of Madison, in said state of Wisconsin, the same being one car load, and transported by said company since the said sixth day of May, 1874, over its road in car numbered 1,497, and your petitioner, on information and belief, shows that said charge and sum so demanded by said railroad company for such service was two dollars in excess of the sum demanded and received by the same company for the same service during the year 1873, and was a higher and greater rate than that fixed and allowed by said chapter 273, and was unreasonable and extor- tionate. And your petitioner further shows, that on the 10th day of May, 1874, the said railroad company charged and received of S. Cadwallader of the city of Madison, the sum of ninety cents for a ticket upon their road, from the city of Madison to Mazomanie, a distance of twenty-three miles, which said sum was higher and greater than the sum and rate fixed therefor by said chapter 273, and was unreasonable and extortionate. That the said Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company has, by the several acts, omissions and things herein charged and set forth, violated the provisions of the said chapter 273, and the laws of the state of Wisconsin, by abuse of its powers, and has offended against the provisions of the several acts creating and altering such corporation, and has exercised privileges and franchises not conferred upon it by law, and has thereby forfeited its privi- leges, franchises and charter as a corporation. That your petitioner has reason to believe that the several acts, omissions and things as herein alleged and set forth can beestablished by proof; that divers particular and specific violations of the provisions of said chapter 273, and of the laws of the state, too numerous to be herein conveniently specified and set forth, can be established by proof. And he therefore asks leave to bring an action in the nature of a quo war- ranto, in the name of the state of Wisconsin, in the supreme court of the said state, against the said Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, for the purpose of vacating the charter and annulling the existance of said corporation.

A drawback of fifteen per cent. of the gross earnings of the pres- ent line of the party of the first part, from Fort Howard or Green Bay to Chicago, from any joint business which shall be done partly on that line and partly on the said Peninsula Railroad; provided, however, that in any year in which a dividend of seven per cent. shall be paid from the earnings of the said Peninsula Railroad upon the said Chicago and Nortwestern Railway Company shall be Peninsula special stock. Such drawback shall be lim- ited, and in case the section from Fort Howard at Green Bay to Escanaba, shall be constructed and put in operation, the aforesaid drawback shall be thereafter discontinued, and such drawback shall be subject to the provisions of application provided in clause first of this article. And it is hereby declared and agreed, that the words net earnings asured in these presents, shall be construed to mean such surplus of the earnings of the railroad herein before described as the &quot;Peninsula Railroad&quot; as shall re- main, after paying all the expenses of operating the said last mentioned rail- road and conducting its business, including all taxes and assessments, and all expenses of repairing or replacing the said Peninsula railroad and branches aforesaid, its equipments and appurtenances, or any part thereof, and such additional equipments and improvements as shall be neces- sary for the adaquate, convenient and economical management and use of the said Peninsula railroad. Article Eighth. The expenses of the general management of the business of the consolidated company hereby formed, other than those incurred for the said Peninsular Railroad, shall continue to be borne by the railroad here- tofore belonging to the party of the first part, without any contribution from the earnings of the said Peninsular Railroad or charge upon the fund afore- said for the benefit of the special stock aforesaid. Article Ninth. On and after the first day of January, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five (1865), all capital stock of the said party of the sec- ond part, and also all the said Chicago &amp;amp; Northwestern Railway Company Peninsular special stock hereafter issued shall be exchangeable for and con- vertible into the preferred and common stocks of the consolidated company hereby formed, at and after the rate of one share of the preferred stock of the said consolidated company hereby formed, and one share of the common stock thereof for every two shares of the said peninsular special stock, or of the present stock of the said party of the second part (with scrip certificates for fractional amounts less than a share), which exchange and conversion shall be at the option of the holder of the stock so authorized to be converted. Provided, however, That upon three-fourths of the whole aggregate amount of the present stock of the party of the second part, and the said peninsular special stock by this agreement provided for, being changed and converted into such common and preferred stocks of the consoli- dated company hereby formed, it shall become obligatory upon the holders of the balance of the said stocks so provided to be converted, to exchange and convert the same into the common and preferred stocks of the consoli- dated company, at the rate aforesaid, upon being required so to do by the said consolidated company, and that dividends after such requisitions on any stock not converted, shall cease until the same be so converted. And provided further, That in order to enable any such holder to make the change and conversion aforesaid, he must first surrender up the certificate or certificates held by him, which he desires so to convert. Provided, nevertheless, and it is hereby expressly declared that in respect to all of the said stock of the party of the second part, and the said peninsular special stock, which shall have been converted under this provision, the same shall be transferred and kept alive for the benefit of the consolidated com- dated company, in any dividend or distribution of profits which may be made so long as any part of the said stock of the party of the second part, or ot the said peninsula special stock shall remain unconverted. Article Tenth. This agreement is hereby declared to be an agreement be- tween the party of the first part and of the consolidated company hereby created with the class of stockholders of the said consolidated company herein designated as holders of the aforesaid Peninsula special stock, within the meaning of an act of the legislature of the state of Wisconsin, entitled &apos; &quot;Net Earnings. 33 gross cept so far as the amount of tax is affected by the returns of receipts under existing law. Charges have been made to the effect that the actual receipts in some cases do not correspond with the returns made to the state in other respects than those already named. The commissioners prefer to give further time to the ex- amination of all the facts involved, before giving countenance to suspicions of so grave a character. The form of reports and meth- ods of investigation contemplated by the commissioners will un- doubtedly prove a sufficient security in the future against any real or imaginary evil in this particular. In direct connection with this question, the propriety of taxing the receipts of colored lines, organized without the state, but re- ceiving their earnings from business within the state, merits serious consideration. A kindred question is that of taxing the receipts in this state from sleeping cars owned without the state. NET EARNINGS. For reasons already explained, it has not been possible to ascer- tain the net earnings of the several railway companies for the year ending December 31, 1874.

It shall be competent to include in said mortgage or deed of trust, all or any part of the franchises, rights and prop- erty of such consolidated company, whether above described or not, and by the foregoing or any other suitable description of premises. It shall also be competent to execute a separate mortgage upon the section between Portage and Oshkosh or any part thereof, to secure a separate issue of bonds. The said mortgage or deed of trust first aforesaid shall contain provisions to the effect as follows, to-wit: That to the extent necessary the bonds to secure which the said instrument is executed, and the full proceeds of the sale there- of, shall stand pledged to the construction and equipment of the several sec- tions of said consolidated railroad as follows, to-wit: Bonds at the rate of twenty thousand dollars per mile, not to exceed fourteen hundred and sixty (1460) to the section from Mendota the state line, nine hundred (900) to the section from the state line to Madison, eight hundred (800) to the section from Madison to Portage. The necessary amount of said bonds last named to be held for the purpose of taking up or exchanging the same for the bonds of the present The Madison and Portage Railroad Company which bear date on the first day of October, A.

That the bonds so pledged to any of the unconstructed sections of said railroad shall not be sold or used until the construction of such section be commenced, and as the work progresses, may be used, provided that no more bonds shall be used in the construction and equipment thereof, than at the rate in bonds at their face of twenty thousand dollars per mile, and in case the said consolidated company shall for five years from the date of such bonds, fail or neglect to undertake the construction of any one or more of the before mentioned sec- tions, or sooner by a resolution of its board of directors shall declare its in- tention not to so construct one or more of said sections or some part thereof, it shall thereupon be the duty of the trustees in said instrument named unless just and sufficient reasons to the contrary shall exist, to cancel, destroy or re- tire the bonds so pledged to the construction of such section or sections, or part thereof, and to place or hold the receipts of any that may have been sold for the benefit of the owners thereof, and it shall also be the duty of said trustees, subject to the qualification aforesaid, to so cancel and destroy the proper number of said bonds in case the length of any of the unconstructed sections of said road, shall after location, prove to be less than the estimates herein before given. In order more effectually to secure the said bonds of the consolidated company first aforesaid, and to avoid any doubts that may arise affecting the sufficiency of the consolidation hereby made, it is provided and agreed, that the organization of each of the companies, parties hereto, shall be sufficient- ly preserved and continued to enable each of them to make and execute its separate mortgage as follows: And parties hereto, in consideration of the promises, do mutually agree to and with each other, that each of said com- panies will duly make and execute its mortgage or deed of trust to secure the entire issue of the said bonds of the consolidated company in like form, with the mortgage aforesaid, and upon all of the property, franchises, etc. covered thereby, and which prior to the consolidation were vested in such companies. Article Eight. In order properly and proportionately to protect the parties interested in the different sections of said road, respectively, it is provided that the said issue of bonds of the consolidated company shall be held by the said company or by the trustee named in such bonds, in trust for the uses and upon the conditions mentioned in the aforesaid article and upon the fur- ther conditions following, to-wit: That if the said bonds are not and cannot be sold after a reasonable time, not less than six months from the issue there. 12-R.

Chapter 380, laws of 1853, authorizes the city of Milwaukee to loan its credit to said company in the sum of $200,00, upon the same terms as to other railway companies. Act approved July 12, 1853. Chap. 121, laws of 1854, authorizes the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company to consolidate its capital stock with the Milwaukee, Fond du Lac and Green Bay Railway Company, and the capital stock was limited to the aggregate capital stock of both companies. Provision was made that either company might withdraw from the arrangement on due notice to the other upon certain specified conditions, etc. Act approved March 9, 1854. Chap. 265, laws of 1854, extends the authority of the city of Milwaukee to loan its credit in aid of railroads from $200,000 to $300,000—provided that the total aggregate of all issues of bonds to all companies should not exceed $1,500,000. Act approved March 31, 1854. Chap. 280, laws of 1856, amends the charter of the La Crosse and Milwau- kee Railroad Company, by additional provisions for the exercise of the right of eminent domain, mode and manner of settling disputes as to value of lands taken, and to take and hold lands in payment for its stock, etc. Company also empowered to subscribe for and hold stock in any other railroad company in the state, and to purchase or lease any other road that connected with its line. Act approved March 28, 1856. Chap. 169, laws of 1856, approved March 18, authorizes the city of Mil- waukee to increase the aggregate limit for which it might loan its credit, to $2,000,000. Chapter 122, Laws of 1856, &amp;quot;an act to grant certain lands to the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, and to execute the trust created by an act of congress, entitled &apos;an act granting public lands to the state of Wiscon- sin, to aid in the construction of railroads in said state,&apos;&amp;quot; approved June 3, 1856. The act empowers the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company to construct lines from Madison and Columbus, on the most direct and feasible route, by way of Portage City, to the St. Croix River or lake, between townships twenty-five and thirty-one, and from thence to the west end of lake Superior and to Bayfield, with all the power, rights and franchises of the original company. The lines from Madison and Columbus to Portage City were both required to be completed by the last day of December, 1858, and for estimating the lands, Madison was designated as the point of commence - ment. In consideration of the agreement, all the lands granted by congress were conferred upon the company upon the line indicated, as well as extra- ordinary powers for loaning money, and other means for carrying on the work-all of which was to be completed and in operation within a period of ten years from date of the grant.

[See printed report of company. Also Mr. Cary&apos;s speech before the Wisconsin legislature, 1874.] With not much more than one-half the debt, the Wisconsin lines earned more than two-thirds the income. - the gross earnings of the entire road for 1873, being $9,046,123. The net income of the Wiscon- sin lines, as shown by the last printed report of the General Man- ager, was over $1,800,000-sufficient to pay about seven per cent. interest on all the bonds, preferred stock and common stock on the Wisconsin portion of the road, at the rate of $37,480 per mile, and leaving remainder of nearly $200,000. This sum would also pay a reasonable interest on the whole investment within the state, as re- ported by the company, without including net earnings expended for new construction. It is impossible at the date of making this report to give the de- tails of business on the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul lines for the year ending December 31, 1874. The gross earnings of the com- pany for the year are given by the General Manager at $8,953,017.11, and the operating expenses for the eleven months ending Novem- ber 30, 1874, at $5,416,809.48.

P &quot; &quot;Remedial Measures. 133 made, and the future policy discussed and decided upon, leaving to the officers their proper functions of executing the will of the pro- prietors; of the property and not as is now the common practice, allowing the officers the entire control and disposal of their prop- erty, and the power of affecting the interests and rights of the public at their will and pleasure-restricting the officers to the per- formance of their legitimate, defined, and limited executive duties, the acquired licensed departure from which has been the cause of the many disorders which exist in railroad operations. From the statements presented of English experience to date, supported by the report of the stockholders&apos; committee of the Pennsylvania Railway company, and by the statement of the Pres- ident of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, the inference is clear that with a railroad corporation under a legitimate acting organization, such as is within the true meaning of the term, its several parts being confined by law to their functional duties, and the whole confined to legitimate, economical business transactions in the interest of both the public and the stockholder,-enlighten- ed public opinion would acquiesce in such an adjustment of charges as could and would be shown, by a constant and complete reveal- ment of its affairs, to afford adequate interest on capital; and no other would be submitted to. Moreover, it would lead, doubtless, to a liberal policy with weak roads when public confidence was cre- ated and the public interest concerned. In other words, the special regulation of rates by legislative in- terference would be superfluous; the duties of the law-making power being confined to preserving intact the harmony of the sev- eral functions of the corporation by restraining and limiting enact- ments. It will be observed that no such state of affairs could exist while the business operations of a company were concealed. And while conceding that it should be the province of govern- ment to correct, as fast as possible, the disorders which have arisen from careless legislation, yet we are met by the question of how to master the difficulties which exist, and which are to be dealt with until the normal condition of railroad corporations can be secured, and resulting just relations established between them and the state, and between them and the people. Stockholders, acting in their proper capacity, might, as in Eng- land, order a full quarterly or semi-annual report. They could re- &quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;Executive and Legal Documents. 37 dictions, but one policy; to make this court indeed a supreme judicial tri- bunal over the whole state; a court of last resort on all judicial questions under the constitution and laws of the state; a court of first resort on all judicial questions affecting the sovereignty of the state, its franchises and pre- rogatives, or the liberties of its people. Attorney Gemeral v. Blossom. The other courts may, indeed, adjudicate public as well as private ques- tions; and the appellate and superintending jurisdiction of this court may therefore reach public as well as private interests. But the framers of the constitution, for greater security, added to these original jurisdiction, over great public interests, for reasons already assigned. In a government like ours, public rights of the state and private rights of citizens often meet, and may well be involved in a single litigation. So it may be in the exercise of the original jurisdiction of the court. But it is safe to say that the constitu- tion is content to intrust purely private rights to the appellate and super- intending jurisdictions given, and to have granted the original jurisdic- tion of this court for the better and prompter and more authoritive protec- tion of public interests. This is its primary and controlling object and char- acter. This is very plainly implied by the grants of the writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, quo warranto and certiorari, as is well reasoned in Attorney Gen- eral v. Blossom. And, plainly recognizing the intention of the constitution to vest in this court one jurisdiction, by several writs, to be put to several uses, for one consistent, congruous, harmonious purpose, we must look at the writ of injunction in the light of that purpose, and seek its use in the kindred uses of the other writs associated with it. Noscitur a sociis is an old and safe rule of construction, said to have originated with as great a lawyer and judge as Lord Hale, peculiarly applicable to this consideration. Lord Bacon gives the same rule in a more detailed form, more emphatic here. Copulatio verborum indicat acceptionem in eodem sensu. Here are several writs of defined and certain application classed with one of vague import. We are to be guided in the application of the uncertain, by its certain asso- ciates. The joinder of the doubtful writ with the defined writs operates to interpret and restrict its use, so as to be accepted in the sense of its associ- ates; so that it and they may harmonize in their use, for the common purpose for which it is manifest that they were all given. And thus in this use and for this purpose, the constitution puts the writ of injunction to prerogative uses and makes it a quasi prerogative writ. There is the less difficulty in reaching this construction, and giving defin- ite meaning to the jurisdiction of injunction, because of the very contrast between this writ and mandamus. The latter commands. The former forbids. Where there is non-feasance, mandamus compels duty. Where there is mal- feasance, injunction restrains wrong. And so near are the objects of the two writs, that there is sometimes doubt which is the proper one; injunction is frequently made mandatory and mandamus sometimes operates restraint. In these very motions it was argued on once side that the remedy of the state is by mandamus, on the other that it is by injunction. And it is very safe to assume that the constitution gives injunction to restrain excess, in the same class of cases as it gives mandamus to supply defect; the use of the one writ or the other in each case turning solely on the accident of over action or short coming of the defendant. And it may be that where defect and excess meet in a single case, the court might meet both, in its discretion, by one of the writs, without being driven to send out both, tied together with red tape, for a single purpose. This view excludes jurisdiction of injunction in private suits, between private parties, proceeding on private right or wrong. In excluding them, we feel quite assured that we are only giving effect to the very purpose and limit of the constitution in the grant of jurisdiction. And we were aided in arriving at this conclusion, by decisions of the supreme court of Missouri, in somewhat analogous cases, excluding original jurisdiction of causes of merely private interest. State v. Stewart, 32 Mo., 379; State v. Lawrence, 38 Mo., 535; Foster v. State, 41 Mo., 61; Vail v. Dinning, 44 Mo., 210; State v. Vail, 53 Mo, 97. In our view, the jurisdiction of the writ is of a quasi pre- rogative writ. The prerogative writs proper can issue only at the suit of the state or the Attorney General in the right of the state; and so it must be with &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 235 does or may exist in the quantity of lands to which the said La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company is or may be entitled, upon that part of its line extending from Madison to the St. Croix river or lake.&amp;quot; By section 2 of said chapter 98, it was made the duty of the governor of the state of Wisconsin to convey to the said company &amp;quot;out of the lands so granted to the state by the aforementioned act of congress, approved June 3, 1856, such quantity of said lands which have been or hereafter may be made applicable thereto as shall make, together with the lands heretofore conveyed to the said Wis.

In reply to an inquiry of the governor of Wisconsin, I ad- dressed him on the 24th of March last, expressing the opinion that the effect of the above act was to authorize the legislature of the state to pass the lands within the limits of the La Crosse and Milwaukee road along the line con- structed prior to July 27, 1868, south of Tomah to the Farm Mortgage Com- pany. &amp;quot;It is now claimed by the company in your argument of the 18th ult., that as they have built 61 miles of road, they are entitled to 480 sections of land, and that the same should be taken from any of the lands certified under the grant of 1856, for this road, known as the La Crosse and Milwaukee, makes it obligatory upon the state of Wisconsin to dispose of the lands granted for the purpose of building that road, and for no other purpose. &quot; &quot;250 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

That sixty-one miles of road would entitle the Farm Mortgage Company to 234,240 acres of land, leaving a balance of 165,419 75-100 acres not re- ceived. In view of these facts, will you be kind enough to explain how these lands (list of December 18, 1863, 324,704 78-100 acres) could be charged by your department to the &amp;quot;West Wisconsin Railroad grant,&amp;quot; as stated in your letter of November 20? And, also, if the West Wisconsin Railroad Company have had the lands, or any of them included in the list of December 1863, are the Railroad Farm-Mortgage Land Company entitled to select the balance of the lands to which they would be entitled from the six to fifteen mile limits of any part of the original grant, to the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company?

PROPOSED MILWAUKEE AND SOUTHERN WISCONSIN NARROW-GAUGE RAILROAD. THE CHIEF ENGINEER TO COMMISSIONER PAUL. THE NATIONAL HOME FOR DISABLED VOLUNTEER SOLDIERS, SURGEON&apos;S OFFICE, Oct. 1, 1874. HON. GEORGE H. PAUL, Railroad Commissioner, Madison, Wis.: MY DEAR SIR: Your esteemed favor of the 29th ultimo, asking my reasons for preferring the narrow gauge, in the constuction of the road from this city to Beloit, is on my desk. Referring to your questions, permit me to reply that the first consideration is the diminished cost of the three-feet gauge, as compared with the four-feet eight and one-half inches. The second consideration is the prospect of ulti- mately connecting with the narrow gauge system which is developing in Iowa and Colorado, and thus open communication with those vast producing regions, and assist in the solution of the problem of cheap transportation. When a narrow gauge road is suggested, the first idea that presents itself&apos; is, as to the capacity of such a track for business. On this point, however, there is ample evidence. W. A. Greenwood, General Manager of the Denver and Rio Grand Narrow Gauge Railway says: &amp;quot;That the system has proved a de- cided success.&amp;quot; The company has nearly 200 miles of road in operation, and as to the capacity of the road he has no hesitation in declaring it equal to that of a broad-gauge road.&amp;quot; He could do as much business on the road as could be done on nineteen-twentieths of the usual gauge roads in the coun- try. As to capacity, it is a question of rolling stock, and not one of the track. &quot; &apos;Laws Relating to Railroads. 283 Shall make fence. How awards of damages for right of way shall be ar- ranged.

Chap. 137, Laws of 1856, approved Oct. 11.

May consolidate with any road in the state of Michigan. Chap. 17, P. Laws of 1857, approved Feb. 12. An act to authorize the Chicago, St. Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad Com. pany and the Wisconsin and Superior Railroad Company to consolidate under the title of &apos; &apos;114 Report of Railroad Commissioners. &quot;On the other hand, the case of the public against the railway companies is a very strong one. They are monopolists who are unlimited in their charges, except by the parliamentary maximum, and who are restricted by no definite limit whatever as regards terminal charges; which two charges they mix up together, and under the present system they do not separate them. They are practically under no restriction except that of their own interest, which may not be the same as that of the public; they claim and exercise the right to vary their charges to any extent they please within the parliamentary maximum; to favor one place, or one description of trade at the expense of another; to charge high rates for short distances and low rates for long distances; or to charge two different rates for the same service, if they think it to their interest to do so. And they not only claim to exercise all these powers, but they refuse to tell the public how they exercise them, or why they exercise them. &quot;It is not surprising, under these circumstances, that there should be dis- content and suspicion, even though there may be no real ground for it; and if the companies should become rich and prosperous, this discontent and suspicion may be aggravated to such an extent as to become dangerous to them. If they are dealing fairly, it is to their interest to court observation and criticism, and to give to the public all possible information about their charges and their reasons for making them.” * * &quot;Under these circumstances, the committee are of the opinion that the rec- ommendation of the Royal Commission should be adopted; that every com- pany should be compelled to keep at every station a book of all the rates, in- cluding special contracts chargeable at that station, and distinguishing ter- minals from mileage rates; that no rate should be legally chargeable unless first entered in this book, and that this book should always be accessible to the public.&quot; GREATER STABILITY OF RATES. We are unable to learn any sufficient reason why rates, when left to the discretion of railroad companies, are so fluctuating. It is easy to see that with freedom to make just discriminations, such as they ought to have, all rates cannot be permanent, or even fixed for an entire season, perhaps. But why should there be such fluctuations in the rates on staple articles of transportation, where the rates are not special but general? And if fluctuation be neces- sary, why should they come so frequently and so irregularly that the producer and shipper are utterly unable to make their calcula- tions with any certainty? There are, doubtless, private reasons, or supposed reasons, but they can hardly be of so much import- ance to the railroad companies as a greater stability of rates is to the public. As these matters are managed at present, every dealer in grain &apos; &apos;Laws Relating to Railroads. 295 merged into the consolidated company, with the aggregate capital stock of both combined. Act approved Oct. 13, 1856. Chap. 23, laws of 1861, repeals chapter 90, local laws of 1853, which author- ized the county of Columbia to aid in the construction of certain railroads, and also chapter 293, laws of 1853, authorizing certain towns to aid in the construction of the Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad Company. Act ap- proved March 18, 1861. MADISON AND PRAIRIE DU CHIEN RAILROAD COMPANY. Chap. 149, laws of 1852, &quot; an act to incorporate the Madison and Prairie du Chien Railroad Company,&quot; is similar in details to other charters of the same class as to organization, and all powers, rights and duties. Act approved March 24, 1852. Chap. 320, laws of 1853, authorizes a consolidation between the Madison and Prairie du Chien and Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad Companies, upon terms to be mutually agreed upon, and an aggregate increase of capital stock to $4,500,000. Act approved June 25, 1853. Chap. 241, Laws of 1864, authorizes the Milwaukee and Prairie du Chien Railway Company to issue stock to aid in adjusting and settling up outstand- ing farm mortgages, judgments, floating debts, income bonds, and stock of the late Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad Company. The act names six trustees, and authorizes them, on assignment of mortgage before Dec. 15, 1864, to issue to persons making assignment, the common stock of the com pany to an equal amount, and to be used for no other purpose. All persons owning or holding any such farm mortgage, judgment, income bond or other claim against said company who failed or neglected to adjust the same with said trustees before December 15, 1864, were barred from any right of action forever against said trustees or their survivors, or the Milwaukce and Prairie du Chien Railway Company. Further provision is made for the discharge of farm mortgages at the request of holders. The act was not to take effect until approved by a majority of each class of stockholders of the Milwaukee and Prairie du Chien Railroad Company. Act approved March 31, 1864. LA CROSSE AND MILWAUKEE RAILROAD COMPANY. Incorporated by chap. 198, Laws of 1852, with the usual powers, rights, du- ties and immunities. Act approved April 2, 1852. Chapter 244, laws of 1853, authorizes the city of Milwaukee to loan its credit to the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad to an amount not exceeding $200,000, with the same provision as to security, etc., as in cases of aid given to others roads. Act approved April 2, 1853. Chapter 308, laws of 1853, authorizes Washington county to loan its credit to said company upon the usual terms. Act approved April 2, 1853.

He may do so whenever public interests have been damnified, or will manifestly be damni- fied, in the result, by transactions which are now taking place. And it would seem from the judgment in Ware v. Regent&apos;s Canal Co. (3 De Gex and J., 212, 228), that he may do so when a corporation is going beyond its special pow- ers, even though no definite injury has been done, or is likely to be done, to the public. Where there has been an excess of the powers given by an act of Parliament, but no injury has been occasioned to any individual, or is immi- nent and of irreparable consequences, I apprehend that no one but the At- torney General, on behalf of the public, has a right to apply to this court, to check the exhorbitance of the party in the exercise of the powers confided to him by the legislature.&amp;quot; Brice&apos;s Ultra Vires, 506–9. The custom of courts of equity to interfere in such cases, at the suit of private parties, for private injuries, is quite old. It seems to have grown up out of the ancient jurisdiction to restrain waste and nuisance. We shall not attempt to trace it. It is recognized as an established jurisdiction by Lord Hardwick, in 1752. Fishmonger&apos;s Co. v. East India Co., 1 Dickens, 163; and particularly as applied to corporations exceeding or abusing their franchises, by Lord Eldon, in 1815. Agar v. Regent&apos;s Canal Co., Cooper, 77. In more recent times, as corporations have grown in number and power, cases apply- ing this jurisdiction to them are very numerous. We cite a few at random: River Dun. N. Company v. North Mid. Railway Company, 1 English Railway Cases, 135; Blackburne v. Glamorgan Canal Navigation, I Mylne and K., 154; Coates v. Clarence Railway Company, 1 Russell &amp;amp; M., 181; Dawson v. Paver, 5 Hare, 415; Broadbent v. Imperial Gas Company, 7 De Gex M. and G., 437; Ware v. Regent&apos;s Canal Company, 3 De Gex and J., 212; London &amp;amp; Brighton Railway Company v. Cooper, 2 English Railway Cases, 312. &amp;quot; The general grounds of jurisdiction, in favor of private persons as well as the public, are stated by Lord Eldon, in Blackmore v. Glamorgan Canal Navi- gation. When I look upon these acts of Parliament, I regard them all in the light of contracts made by the legislature, on behalf of every person inter- ested in anything to be done under them; and I have no hesitation in assert- ing that, unless that principle is applied in construing statutes of this de- scription, they become instruments of greater oppression than anything in the whole system of administration under our constitution. Such acts of Parliament have now become extremely numerous; and, from their number and operation, they affect so many individuals, that I apprehend those who come from them to Parliament, do, in effect, undertake that they shall do and submit to whatever the legislature empowers and compels them to do; and that they shall do nothing else; that they shall do and forbear all that they are required to do and forbear, as well with reference to the intersts of the public, as with reference to the interests of the individuals. It is upon this ground that applications are frequently made,&amp;quot; etc. And the jurisdiction is now clearly defined as having two branches, one on behalf of the state, for public wrong, and the other on behalf of private per- sons, for private wrong, as arising from an excess or abuse of corporate fran- chise. Relief against public wrong is confined to informations by the attor- ney general. Ware v. Regent&apos;s Canal Company, 3 De Gex and J., 212; Brown v. Monmouth Railway and Canal Company, 13 Beavan, 32. And it has been held, on the other hand, that the Attorney General cannot maintain infor mation on the ground of mere private wrong. Attorney General v. Bir- mingham and O. Railway Company, 4 De Gex and S., 190 and 3 McNaghten &amp;amp; G., 453. Though doubt is thrown upon this point by the later case of Ware v. Regent&apos;s Canal Company, 3 De Gex and J., 212. Be that as it may, the authority of the English chancery to restrain corpo- rate violations injuring or tending to injure public welfare, or to defeat pub- lic policy, at the suit of the Attorney General, as stated by Mr. Brice, is now beyond controversy.

And hence, although ample facilities are afforded for the convenient trial of offenders by giving to justices of the peace concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts, yet, as in other actions of a criminal nature, no prosecution can originate otherwise than in complaint made by the injured party or some other person having knowledge of the offense. With the usual cheerful obedience given to the laws, a few applications of this remedy would induce a general acquiescence. But if the aggregate wealth of great corporations is to support an organized and general defiance of law, the only means provided must be cordially employed by all good citi- zens, and your Executive sustained by the hearty co-operation of subordinate officials. I cannot doubt that this support and co-operation will be accorded, when the whole case is fully understood. The interests at stake are too vast and too vital to admit of any other conclusion. For it will then be seen, not only that this particular law, framed by a legislature of your own choosing, enacted in your interest, and in obedience to your own express command, is disregard- ed and contemned, but that the very idea and principle of law, and a just sense of the duty of obedience to the constituted authorities, would be clouded and imperilled by a neglect promptly to meet, rebuke and punish such de- fiance of the popular will. It will also be seen that the people are dealing with a powerful and dangerous combination, which holds itself above the law, and seeks to make its own sanction superior to the sanction of any stat- ute-that it is not the form and terms of this law upon which issue is taken, but that these corporations deny the principle that a railway, though built with the public consent, for a public use, and in part with the aid of public gifts, and chartered under a constitution which expressly reserves to the peo- ple the right of general control, can, for any purpose, in any way, be limited as to its tolls by regulations other than those of tts own corporators. Believing, then, that to the authority of the state and to the support of the public officers in their efforts to curb and restrain the threatening powers of the great bodies which now boldly defy them, you will bring promptly and manfully all the aid and co-operation which every citizen owes to the state in any time of peril to her institutions, her authority, or her laws, and being deeply sensible of the obligations resting upon me to avert, if possible, the danger now impending, I call upon and enjoin every citizen of this state to observe with scrupulous care the requirements of the law herein referred to, in every instance and particular of business dealings with any railroad com- pany of this state, especially the companies herein named; to pay as a trav- eler no higher fare than the law prescribes; to pay as a shipper or receiver of freights no higher rates than the law prescribes, all which rates the Railroad Commissioners have fixed and published; and that if in any exigency or necessity he should suffer any sum in excess of legal rates to be extorted from him by any agent of any such company, he notify, with all covenient dis- patch, the district attorney of his county of such violation of law. I also request and enjoin all district attorneys promptly and vigorously to prosecute to conviction and punishment all offenders against said law. I further enjoin all constables and police officers within this state, to in- quire of all such offences, and to complain against the offenders before some justice of the peace, and diligently to take care that this law be not violated in their own precincts with impunity. Printed forms and instructions for the prosecution of such actions will be promptly furnished, on the request of any officer of the law, made to he At- torney General, at Madison. In the possible contingency of a sufficient resistance to the local authorities to require the interference of the Executive, the guarantees contained in my proclamation of May 1st, can be relied on with the utmost confidence.

These remarks apply equally to Wisconsin roads and to those of the other states; all are alike obnoxious to criticism. It may be supposed that, when all our roads are laid with steel, which will be the case at no distant day, all these matters will claim more nearly their due share of attention. Meantime, they are all the more essential. The mileage of our roads already laid with steel rail is as fol- lows: COMPANIES AND LINES. Miles. lbs. wt. Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul R.

On some of the roads—the Chicago and North- western and the Milwaukee and Chicago Division of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul, more especially-they are equal to the best to be found anywhere in the country. Indeed, it may be a question whether some of our best coaches for passengers and rail- way officers are not more elegant and expensive than they ought to be. Nothing essential to comfort should be spared; but that thou- sands of dollars may be properly expended in mere decoration, thus making a railway coach cost the price of a handsome residence, while at the same time lives are endangered for want of repairs to track, is hardly a matter of question; it is pretty clearly wrong. Would it not be better to curtail a little on garniture and add some- thing to the neatness and comfort of station-houses, very many of which, like the Union Depot at Milwaukee, are mere shells or over- grown shanties, neither gratifying the taste nor providing even the bare comforts for the traveling public. &quot; &apos;34 Report of Railroad Commissioners. the net earnings for 1874 will show a relative falling off. But this has been true of the whole country; the short crops, and the gen- eral stringency of the times having borne heavily upon the trans- portation interest. On the other hand, the reports hitherto made by the principal companies, warrant the expectation that the full returns for the year 1874, will show an absolute increase upon the net receipts of the year 1873, and this, notwithstanding the operation of the law du- ring the quarter just ended, the effect of which has been to cause some reduction. The Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Company report a total loss of $120,040.82, entailed by enforcement of the law during the last quarter of the year-$66,726.27 in the freight department of their business, and $53,313.82 in the passenger department. The Chicago and Northwestern report a loss from the same cause, during the months of October and November, of 24 per cent. on their passenger business, and 26 per cent. on freight. That any of the roads, in times of so great depression, and under the working of a law claimed to be ruinous, should have increased the amount of their net earnings is an encouraging fact, indicating, as it does, the steady industrial progress of the state. Your commissioners are not yet completely furnished with the requisite data for determining whether the maximum rates fixed by the law, are or are not in some cases lower than the companies can adopt with a reasonable expectation of earning under them a fair profit on the legitimate cost of their roads. On the one hand, we are not prepared to allow that the rates are ruinous, as is claimed by the railway companies, which have not hardly made, as yet, a full and fair trial of them; and on the other hand it is undeniable that those rates are considerably lower than are at present charged by a great majority of the railroads of the country, as plainly appears from the comparative statements to be found on pages 265,- 270 of this report, in which the tariff charges made by a number of leading roads, west and east, taken at random, are placed side by side with the &quot;Potter Law&quot; rates. The question will naturally arise upon making the comparison, why the other roads quoted may not bring their rates down to a level with those of the Atlantic and Graet Western and the Balti- more and Ohio roads.

It is true I named the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company as an example, but the same questions occur with all our other connecting roads, and who have not agreed to anything. It seems to me that it devolves upon the commission to give me instruc- tions in this respect, or to decline to do so. I do not wish to appear discour- teous, but if this company is to be governed in its transportation by a law, the interpretation of which law is left to the commissioners, is it not right and fair that they should give us their interpretation of it to guide us?

H. PORTER, General Manager C. &amp;amp; N. W. R. R. Co.: DEAR SIR: Your favor of the 18th was duly received, and would have been answered before, but for absence. In my communication of the 10th, I en- deavored to make clear our interpretation of the law, and beg leave to call your attention to the fact that such interpretation is by no means the interpre tation rendered by your proposed circular, which you desire the commission to adopt as authoritative. The position of the Commissioners, as expressed in my letter of the 10th, containing an extract from a reply to Mr. Swan of the West Wisconsin, was arrived at understandingly after consultation; the same question being there raised by him, as by yourself. If the law makes it imperative on this board to adjust the several amounts to be received for services by connecting roads, we should be glad to know it. It is understood that the supreme court did not touch this question, although adjusting the one as to the entire charge for services. The question of adjusting amounts for services between con- necting roads, although not now required by law, is perhaps a proper subject for the Railroad Commissioners; but to arrive at just conclusions, and to act understandingly, I am also of opinion that the whole matter should be in- quired into by the board, and the former basis of adjustment as practiced by the roads, subjected to investigation before we could arrive at an equitable decision. Such a course, I think you would agree with me as being neces- sary, and that it would require time and a collection of testimony from dif- ferent sources bearing upon practical methods heretofore suggested, perhaps, by experience. Very truly yours, J. H.

PART I. THE WORK OF CLASSIFICATION. Soon after the organization of the board, early in May, and the determination of a general plan of procedure, your commissioners prepared and issued, for the use of the railroad companies and the public, the classification of roads and of fares and freights here- with submitted, in accordance with the provisions of sections 2, 3 and 13 of the law. [See pp. 1-4, of this report.] Section 13 likewise empowers the board to make important. changes in existing classifications of articles of freight transported on any railroad or parts of railroads, and &quot;to reduce the rates on any of said railroads or parts of railroads, either in general or special classes, when in their judgment, or a majority of them, it can be done without injury to such railroad.&quot; This power to reduce the rates we have not seen fit to exercise. Nor have we made any of the changes in classification which the law authorizes, although there have been some reasons for so do- ing; deeming the policy of non-interference wise in all cases where there was room for doubt, and believing that further time, and a thorough investigation were essential to just conclusions. RECEIPTS, COST, NET EARNINGS AND INDEBTEDNESS. The law also prescribes that the commissioners shall, during the month of January in each year, ascertain and make return to the State Treasurer, &quot;1. THE ACTUAL COST of each railroad in this state, up to and including the 31st day of the next preceding December; and if such railroad shall be partly in and partly out of this state, then the actual cost of so much thereof as is in the state. 2. THE TOTAL GROSS RECEIPTS resulting from the operation of every such railroad during the next preceding year, ending on the 31st day of Decem- ber, or of that part of the same which is in this state. 3. THE TOTAL NET EARNINGS resulting from the operations of any such railroad during the next preceding year, ending on the 31st day of December, or of that part of the same which is in this state. 4. THE TOTAL INTEREST-BEARING INDEBTEDNESS of the company owning or operating such railroad, and the amount of interest paid by such company during the next preceding year, ending on the 31st day of December; and if &apos; &quot;Official Papers and Correspondence. 45 EXPENSES DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1874.

The whole road is 326 miles in length, and its present officers and directors are officers and directors of the Chicago and Northwest- ern Company. [See Appendix for copy of agreement.] The operating expenses, taxes and interest for the four proprie- tary roads, enumerated as not included in the report of the C. and N. W. Company, exceeded the gross earnings for the year ending May 31, 1873, by the sum of $315,287.01-a deficiency necessarily made up from the net earnings derived principally from Wisconsin and Illinois. The only road of the four lying within the boun- daries of Wisconsin, is the La Crosse, Trempealeau and Prescott, and that road is self-sustaining-thus showing that the deficiency named arose wholly from the operation of that portion of these roads outside the state. Among the payments made from the net earnings of the Chicago and Northwestern Company for the year ending May 31, 1873, was the item we have heretofore given, of $928,423.09 for&amp;quot; rent of leased roads, Iowa.&amp;quot; This rent was paid for the &amp;quot; Chicago, Iowa and Nebras- ka line,” ($398,407.50) from Clinton to Cedar Rapids, and for the &amp;quot;Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad&amp;quot; ($530,815.58) from Cedar Rapids to the Missouri River, opposite Omaha. These two roads are over 350 miles in length. The earnings and expenses of these two lines for the year ending May 31, 1873, are nowhere separately reported by the company- either in the annual printed report of the company, or in any report heretofore made to this state or to the state of Illinois. The report of the company for the year ending May 31, 1872, however, shows that the earnings of both these lines, together with the earnings of the Iowa Midland, above operating expenses, did not aggregate a sufficient amount to pay the rental on the two roads-the Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska and the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River-the deficiency being $223,193.91. The stock and bonds of the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River road are reported by Poor&apos;s Railroad Manual for 1874-5 to equal the sum of $41,000 per mile the aggregate amount being $11,234,000. This road has also received from government a dona- tion of land, already converted to possession, of 1,121,276 acres, ―― &quot; &apos;238 Report of Railroad Commissioners. 5. That by the act of the Wisconsin legislature, March 6, 1868, the Wiscon- sin Railroad Farm Mortgage Land Company was authorized to receive all the lands that the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad was entitled to for building the road from Portage City to Tomah. 6. This act of the Wisconsin legislature was approved by congress, 27th July, 1868, &quot;for such lands as may be due the state for the portion of the road already completed.&quot; 7. The 15th Sept., 1868, the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company quit- claimed to the Wis. R. R. F. M. L. Co., and state that the La Crosse and Mil- waukee R. R. Co. completed the 61 miles from Portage City to Tomah, but never received title or conveyance of said lands or any portion thereof. 8. That January 25, 1869, Governor Fairchild certified to the Secretary of the Interior that the 61 miles had been completed. 9. That March 7, 1870, Governor Fairchild executed a deed of trust to the Wisconsin Railroad Farm Mortgage Land Company for 28,931.10 acres of land, which lands were included in the list of 324,704.78 acres, dated Decem- ber, 1863, and on the 8th of April, 1871, executed to said company another trust deed for 39,889.11 acres, from list of 28th of September, 1870, in all 68,820.21 acres of land, as vacant and unappropriated and applicable to the route of the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad, and to the Wisconsin Railroad Farm Mortgage Land Company. 10. The act of 22d of March, 1872, repealed the grant to the St. Croix and Lake Superior Railroad Company, covering lands from St. Croix to the west end of Lake Superior and to Bayfield; “provided, nothing in the act shall be construed to impair the right of the Wisconsin Railroad Farm Mortgage Land Company to the grant of land by congress, June 3, 1856.&quot; 11. The act of March 23, 1872, declares that the Wisconsin Railroad Farm Mortgage Land Company is entitled to the right reserved by the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company in its contract with the St. Croix and Lake Superior Railroad Company, the 10th of March, 1857. (The reserve in the contract was for the purpose of making good any deficiency in the quan- tity of land received by the La Crosse and Milwaukee on the route from Madison to St. Croix, outside of the six and inside of the fifteen mile limits.) Section two makes it the duty of the Governor to convey to the Farm Mortgage Company such quantity of land as, together with the lands hereto- fore conveyed to the Farm Mortgage Company, will make six sections for each mile of railroad from Potage City to Tomalı. FROM MADISON TO PORTAGE. By chapter 233 of the private and local laws of 1861, approved April 12, 1861, so much of the lands granted the state June 3, 1856, &quot;as is or can be made applicable to the construction of that part of said railroad lying be- tween the city of Madison and the city of Portage,&quot; was granted to the Sugar River Valley Railroad Company,&quot; and so much of the act of Oct. 11, 66 &apos; &quot;Official Papers and Correspondence. 69 Fond du Lac to this place, and, as we understand the Potter law, the rates should be only $13.00, via Watertown.

DEAR SIR: We opened a correspondence with Mr. Geo. H. Paul in regard to the matter of freights, and as he sent our letter to you now that we desire more nformation, on the subject we thought best to address you directly. The Railroad Co., would like us to change our place of purchasing our lum- ber, which we cannot do as part of our firm are manufacturers of lumber, at Fond du Lac. The R. R. Co., now require freight paid in advance at Fond du Lac where the cars are to be transferred on to the C. Mil., &amp;amp; St. Paul Ry. Please inform us without delay, whether the railroad company have a right to require pre-payment of freights, and if so, to collect more mileage than the Potter Law has heretofore given them, regardless of transfer from one road on to another? Whether they are entitled to two starting points, and if not, and we should tender the railway company the amount of freight from Fond du Lac to this place, according to the Potter Law rates, $14,5%, and they refuse to accept of the same, what is to be done? And in case they have a right to exact pre-payments of freights, and we tender them the same at Fond du Lac and they refuse to accept, what would be the best course to pursue? And further, in regard to back pay [overpayments previous to injunction], Mr. Geo. H. Paul says, that we have a right of action against the company ? &quot; &quot;Executive and Legal Documents. 73 Subscribed and sworn to before me this 17th day of September, A. D. 1874. GEO. H.

MADISON AND PORTAGE RAILROAD TO MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL COMPANY. PRESIDENT CAMPBELL TO PRESIDENT MITCHELL. NEW YORK, 26th March, 1871. HON. ALEX. MITCHELL, President Mil. and St. Paul R. R.

Yours, truly, JAMES CAMPBELL, President Madison and Portage R. R. Co. PRESIDENT MITCHELL TO PRESIDENT CAMPBELL. MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL RAILWAY, NEW YORK, 24th March, 1871. JAMES CAMPBELL, ESQ., President Madison and Portage Railway Co: DEAR SIR: Your letter inquiring on what terms the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company would be willing to take possession of and operate the Madison and Portage Railroad, is received. In answer, I state, that the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company are willing to take possession of, and op- erate said road on the following terms, namely: The earnings of the road shall be applied: 1. To the payment of operating expenses, including repairs and renewals of road-bed and equipment, and your company shall have the right to audit the accounts. 2. Any excess after paying operating expenses shall be applied by the Mil- waukee and St. Paul Company to payment of interest on the present mort- gage debt of the Madison and Portage Railroad Company. 3. Any excess after paying operating expenses and interest as above, shall be divided equally between our two companies. And the occupation and operation of the road under this proposal may be terminated by either party on notice of 30 days. Yours truly, ALEX. MITCHELL, President. PRESIDENT CAMPBELL TO PRESIDENT MITCHELL. NEW YORK, 24th March, 1871. Hon. ALEX. MITCHELL, Prest. Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company: DEAR SIR:-Your letter in answer to mine of this date, stating.on what &quot; &quot;108 Report of Railroad Commissioners. but one conclusion, namely: that railway poreprty in its relations to government should be placed upon the same basis as other property, and its value be determined from year to year by an actual appraisal. In the opinion of the commissioners, this method of estimate is more practicable, more just in principle, and more likely to prove satisfactory and acceptable to all interests concern- ed. In the determination of the value of railway property upon this basis, original cost, capital and debt, the market value of stock and bonds, and especially the market value of labor and materials at any given period of time, all become important elements in the calculation. If the correctness of this method should be admitted, the fact to be first determined in the endeavor to ascertain the net profits to which a railroad company is equitably entitled, would be the actual existing value of the property; in other words, the actual cash cost of reproducing the same property. Under this system of estimate, the appraisal of one year becomes the basis of succeeding appraisals, additions and substractions being made for previous errors of fact and judgment, and also for new construction, improvement or depreciation, actually ascertain- ed for any current year. In this manner an appraisal ultimately becomes the result of cumulative judgment and investigation, and is not likely to differ largely from an equitable accuracy. Legislative limitations of appraisal.-Should a modification in the principle of the existing law as to the valuation of railway property be deemed wise by the present legislature, the legislature itself might, and undoubtedly should, determine the conditions upon which the board of commissioners should fix the appraisal of the different branches of our railway system. Furthermore, the commissioners should be enabled to avoid even the appearance of partiality by the occasional employment of a practical engineer, for the revision of estimates made. DIRECT LIMITATIONS UPON RATES OF FARE. In the expression of these views, we have referred more specifi- cally to the legislative restrictions upon the practical details of rail- way management, including rates of charge for freight. We are not prepared to assert that the determination of maximum rates of fare by legislative enactment is liable to equal objection. The cost of transporting passengers on a given route is more equal and &quot; &quot;The Problem to be Solved. 77 dation united them under one management, and have since become very formidable competitors of the state. At times, the competi- tion between the state and private lines has been so sharp as to embarrass both parties, and force upon them mutual concessions, and at last to a compromise in the form of &amp;quot;joint purses measures commonly resorted to by independent railway compa- nies in dealing with each other. or other Theoretically, no company can lower its tariff without both per- mission from the minister of public works, and 15 days&apos; public notice; the penalty for disregard of the provision being that the minister may compel the company to make the illegal reductions applicable to all traffic of the same class. The regulations governing interchange of traffic, use of track, terminal charges, and division of earnings are definitely fixed. The upshot of the contest so vigorously waged for some years between the state and the companies, appears to have been finally settled upon the basis of a common understanding. Had the state not seized upon the best opportunities when the field was open, or, having the advantage in this regard, it had not pushed the enter- prise with remarkable energy, the case would probably have been very different. Having the power to prescribe general conditions at the outset, the ability to make experiments in the interest of the public, and caring nothing as to how near the profits were reduced to the four per cent. acceptable to the legislature, the state seems to have at last settled the railway problem for Belgium, in a pretty satisfactory manner. 8. The Holland system. In Netherlands, the net-work of canals is so extensive and af- fords such facilities for handling the heavy freight, that the railway system has developed slowly and assumed comparatively little im- portance in respect of the questions herein considered. The prin- cipal lines were constructed at the cost of the state, but are ope- rated by private companies, under a form of lease which reserves to the state a certain general control, that guarantees successful working.

The Sheboygan and Fond du Lac Railroad Company was incorporated by act of territorial legislature, January 25, 1847, with the usual powers, privi- leges and franchises granted by charters at that period. Five thousand shares of stock of fifty dollars each were required to be subscribed for, and five dol- lars on each actually paid, as a preliminary to organization. On the comple- tion of ten miles of track the company were authorized to receive such sums of money for passengers and freight as they deemed reasonable, but the right was reserved to the legislature to alter and reduce such tolls, but not to an ex- tent to reduce the profits of the company below twelve per cent. on the capi- tal stock invested. Act approved Junuary 25, 1847. &quot; &apos;Railway Statistics. 233 That Messrs. White and Pratt, subsequently, on May 5, 1863, conveyed to the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company their title. 10 On the 7th of March, 1870, the Governor of the state executed to the Com- missioners of the Farm Mortgage Company a trust deed for 28,931 acres of land, which deeds recites as follows: The act of congress, June 3, 1856. The act of the legislature of Wisconsin of October 11, 1856. 100 That on the 16th of December, 1863, a list of the lands within six mile lim- its, granted to the state by said act of congress, was approved to the state by the Secretary of the Interior, in which list were included the lands hereinafter described. That the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad duly accepted said grant, and subsequently, and within the time limited in said act, built and completed sixty-one continuous miles of railroad, being from Portage City to Tomah, but never received title to or conveyance of said lands, or any portion thereof, except as above specified. The act of the legislature of March 6, 1868, is then referred to, and the act of Congress of July 27, 1868, and the quit-claim deed of the St. Paul Railway Company, September 15, 1868. And that on the 25th of January, 1869, the Governor of Wisconsin certified to the Secretary of the Interior that said 61 miles had been completed. Also a second trust deed was issued by the Governor of Wisconsin to the said company, on the 8th of April, 1871, for 39,889 acres of land. The total amount of land conveyed by the two deeds, was 68,820.21 acres. The list of December 16, 1863, which is referred to in the two trust deeds is recorded in the office of Secretary of State, and reads as follows: “North of base line, and east of 4th meridian.

For the purpose of increasing the credit of the land grant bonds, and of furthering the construction of the road to La Crosse, an additional deed of trust was subsequently executed, by which the issue of these bonds, as a lien upon the road from Portage City to La Crosse, and upon the lands belonging to the line from Portage City to the Junction (307,200 acres), should be limited to $4,000,000. By the terms of the lease to Mr. Chamberlain, the earnings of the road were first to be applied to necessary repairs of road and rolling stock; secondly, to the payment of interest on the mortgage debt and sinking fund of the Eastern division (amounting to $189,- 980), and the surplus to the payment of Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s judgment. By the new contract for completing the line to La Crosse, the earnings of the Western division were to be applied, first, to the payment of interest on the land grant bonds, and the surplus to the same purposes as stipulated in the lease. Mr. Chamberlain was.to receive $1,500,000 in the bonds on his con- tract. The company were thus left without income except for purposes above specified. The directors attributed the following liabilities to the contest for the land grant. Construction bonds of 1862, charter expenses, $1,000,000; construction bonds of 1867, for purchase of St. Croix and Lake Superior Co., $1,000,000; stock, for charter expenses at Madison, $90,000; consolidation bonds, for stock in the M. &amp;amp; W. Co., and for &amp;quot;services,&amp;quot; $210,000; notes to M. &amp;amp; W. Co, $150,000; capital stock, sold at 60 to 75 per cent. to meet debts of M. &amp;amp; W. Co., $600,000. Total, $3,050,000. No part of this sum is now in- cluded in the capital of the road.

Books of subscription were opened in Milwaukee, October 22, 1853. Di- rectors were elected November 26, 1853. The engineer was directed to make a survey from Horicon to Stevens Point, and stock agents proceeded to the towns and villages on the line to secure additional subscriptions, and to re- ceive in full payment of stock, mortgages on real estate, at half its value, at eight per cent. interest. Subscriptions of this class were first received to the amount of $300,000. January 20, 1854, a contract was made with the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, to form a connection with the Milwaukee and Horicon Company at Horicon. The former company agreed to carry all passengers and freight of the latter company, to and from points between Milwaukee and Horicon, and north of that point, for eighty per cent. of all receipts from said passengers, freight and storage-all necessary freight and baggage cars being furnished by the Milwaukee and Horicon Company. January 25, 1854, the stockholders voted to fix the termination of the road at Berlin, and a con- tract was entered into for building the road to that point, ready for the roll- ing stock, except iron, chairs and spikes, for $5,400 per mile, one-half cash, &quot; &quot;322 Report of Railway Commissioners.

There should at least be some general rule for making a reasonable de- duction where a car is loaded, even though it be with an article not usually ordered by the car load. For example, why should a manufacturer of wagons be forced to pay $120 for hauling a car loaded with steel and bar iron, instead of $40, the price for hauling a car load of pig iron or lead? By reason of the superior value of the steel and iron he could afford to pay something more for the hauling perhaps; but the difference between a car-load of pig, in a special class, and ten tons of bar-iron, rated in a general class by the 100 pounds, is too great for the encouragement of this manu- facturing industry. INTERCHANGE OF TRAFFIC. It is certainly of great importance that each railroad company should be able to give a through rate to any point on any other company&apos;s road. It should also have the right, where lines con- nect or gauge of track does not prevent, to send such freight through without transhipment, by paying for use of track and hauling of his car or cars. This could be done under the law as it stands, if provision were made for a division of earnings, so that quarrels between com- panies would not arise on account of inequality. PROHIBITION OF UNJUST DISCRIMINATION. Manifestly, a very large proportion of the evils connected with railway management, arise from discriminative charges. But this fact does not prove the propriety of an exact uniformity of tolls under all circumstances. The existing law clearly recognizes a broad distinction between the cost of transporting one class of freight and another. It also recognizes a difference in the value of service performed, based upon the distance of transportation. Under the law, grain is charged one rate and lumber another, and the rate of either is greater for the first twenty-five miles than for the second twenty-five miles. In principle these discriminations are just. But by what rule are discriminations denied in other cases, when equally founded upon principles of equity or necessity? The actual cost of railway transportation depends upon a vast number of peculiar and constantly varying conditions. In the transportation of freight, value of track and equipment, grade of &quot; &apos;30 Report of Railroad Commissioners. which, at an estimated value of $5.00 per acre, would increase the first cost of the road to about $60,000 per mile. The Chicago and Northwestern Company leased this road, fur- nishes all the rolling stock, and for the year ending May 31, 1873, as hereinbefore stated, paid a rental of $530,015.59. The road is about 272 miles long. The report of the Chicago and Northwestern Company for the year ending May 31, 1874, furnishes a still more palpable evidence of the disproportionate expenditure of the income of the company proper, upon its &quot;proprietary&quot; lines. For further particulars we refer to the statistics on pages 101-111. The net earnings of the parent company for the year last named exceeded the sum of $5,000,000, while the net earnings of the combined system of roads. were about half that sum only. As the report of the company shows, the amount paid for rentals on Iowa roads the past year, was $1,049,649.31; for expenses, interest, etc., of the proprietary roads, during the year, $556,671.63, and for new construction and equipment of the proprietary roads, $1,065,278.92. The statement of the general income account of the company for the same year shows a previous payment of advances to the same lines of $865,702.93 from the income of the preceding year. The fair inference from these premises is, that if the earnings of the Chicago and Northwestern Comwany were not disproportion- ately applied to the support of comparatively unprofitable pur- chases and rentals west of the Mississippi river, the surplus of the company for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1873. and also for the year ending May 31, 1874, would have been very largely in excess of the sum reported for net profits under existing circumstances. The number of miles of road operated by the Chicago and North- western Company in the state of Wisconsin for the year ending December 31, 1873-exclusive of the La Crosse, Trempealeau and Prescott-is given by the company in its report to the Secretary of State, at 473 54-100, and for the year ending May 31, 1874, at 565.- 68 miles. We have no present means of ascertaining the separate cost and earnings of this portion of the road from the company it- self. In its report to the state of Illinois for the year ending June 30, 1873, the company says: &quot;The line of road operated by this company extends into five different states; over these lines its equipment is run in common, or transferred from place to place as the changes in business may temporarily require.

In both branches of the jurisdiction, it proceeds as for quasi nuisance and it is diffi- cult to understand why the jurisdiction should be asserted as to private nuisance, and denied as to public nuisance; why, for the same cause, indi- viduals should have a remedy denied to the aggregate of individuals, called the public. But, as we remarked before, in this regard, the judicial voice in America is less certain in tone than in England. We should be willing to follow the English rule, in this state, unless there were a preponderance of American authority against it. But fortunately we find this wholesome juris- diction sustained here by the great weight of authority, and with modern ex- perience, we deem it only a question of time when it must be universally as- serted and exercised. In Bigelow v. Hartford Bridge Co., supra, Storrs, J., takes occasion to say: &amp;quot;Indeed, it is upon the ground of particular injury to the plaintiff, distinct from what he suffers in common with the rest of the public, that all applica- tions against what is a public nuisance is sustained. And there is no good reason why, apart from such special injury, relief should be granted in this mode, at the instance of a particular individual, Courts of equity, in this respect, proceed on the principle which prevails in courts of law, that an ac- tion will not lie in respect of a public nuisance, unless the plaintiff has sus- tained a particular damage from it and one not common to the public gener- ally. To preserve and enforce the rights of persons as individuals, and not as members of the community at large, is the very object of all suits, both at law and in equity. The remedies which the law provides in cases where the rights of the public are affected are ample and appropriate; and to them re- course should be had when such rights are violated. The courts of equity in England will indeed sustain informations, not by individuals, but at the suit of the Attorney General or the proper crown officer, for the purpose of abating public nuisances and what are termed pourprestures. That mode of proceeding has been, however, hitherto unknown here, and whether it would be tolerated in any case it is unnecessary to consider.&amp;quot; 14 Conn., 578. This is not a very accurate statement of the jurisdiction, which does not go to abate, but to restrain, which is the very ground of it, as distinct from legal remedies. The court holds the jurisdiction in cases of private nuisance and of public nuisance inflicting particular injury, at the suit of an individ. ual, and questions it at the suit of the state. It is not easy to comprehend why the remedy should avail against the less evil, and not against the greater; why equity should interpose to restrain what affects one person only, and re- fuse its protection against what affects all persons; in the case of a public nuisance, restrain it at the suit of one whom it especially aggrieves, and re- fuse to do for the public whom it equally aggrieves. The reason assigned signally fails, for remedies at law reach private as well as public nuisances. If, in saying that the remedy by information in behalf of the state was hitherto unknown there, the court meant in Connecticut, it was probably cor- rect; if in the United States, it was certainly mistaken. Bigelow v. The Hartford Bridge Co. was decided in 1842. As early as 1834, the jurisdiction was entertained and asserted by the court of chancery of New Jersey, in Attorney General v. New Jersey R. R. Co., 2 Green, 136. The Chan- cellor says: &amp;quot;It would seem, at first, incongruous and improper for this court to inter- fere in cases of public nuisance. The very fact that nuisances of that char- acter are offenses against the community, and necessarily savor of criminality in a greater or less degree, would seem to distinguish them as matters not proper to be dealt with by this court. But the jurisdiction of chancery, to a certain extent, in cases of public nuisance, appears to be admitted, although it has been very rarely exercised. It is asserted by Lord Hardwick in Baines v. Baker, Ambler 159; 3 Atkins, 750; and is considered as existing_by Lord Eldon, in the case of the Attorney General v. Cleaver, 18 Vesey, 211. He speaks with caution on the subject, as though it were new but not disputed ground. Chancellor Kent, in Att&apos;y Gen. v. Utica Ins. Co., 2 Johns. Ch., 371, appears rather to question the jurisdiction; considering that the cases of pourpresture which have often occurred in the Court of Exchequer on the equity side, differ in some important particulars from a strict case of public nuisance. He seems to think that the case of Baines v. Baker, before Lord Hardwick, &quot; &quot;Records of Railway Companies. 117 and St. Paul Railway Company, a corporation duly incorporated by the state of Wisconsin, of the second part, witnesseth: That the Minnesota Central Railway Company, for and in consideration of three thousand five hundred and twenty shares of the capital stock of the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, of which one-half is preferred stock, and one-half is common stock, and (of the present market value of about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars), all received to the full satis- faction of the Minnesota Central Railway Company, they have granted, bar- gained, sold and conveyed, and by these presents doth grant, bargain, sell and convey unto the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, and to their suc- cessors and assigns forever, all their railway from a point where the same connects with said Milwaukee and St. Paul line of railway, in the city of Austin, county of Mower, running southerly to the state line, to a point of connection with the Cedar Falls and Minnesota Railway Company, including the right of way, and land occupied by said railway company for railway or station house purposes, and all the appurtenances, privileges and franchises appertaining to the operation of said railroad between the points named; also embracing all depots, station houses and lands used tor railroad purposes, and all buildings erected or in process of erection thereon. * * DEED CONVEYING THE ST. PAUL AND CHICAGO RAILWAY TO THE MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL RAILWAY COMPANY. This indenture made the third day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two, between the St. Paul and Chicago Railway Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Minnesota, of the first part, and the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Com- pany, a corporation under the laws of the state of Wisconsin, of the second part, witnesseth; That the St. Paul and Chicago Railway Company, party of the first part, in consideration of the sum of four million dollars, to be paid by the Milwau- kee and St. Paul Railway Company, party of the second part, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, hath granted, bargained, sold, remised, re- leased, aliened, enfeoffed and confirmed, and hereby grants, bargains, sells, remises, releases, enfeoffs and confirms to the Milwaukee and St. Paul Rail- way Company, party of the second part, its successors and assigns forever, the line of railway, of the party of the first part, commencing at its terminus, in the city of St. Paul, thence in a southerly direction on the east bank of the Mississippi river through the counties of Ramsey and Washington, to a point opposite or nearly opposite to the city of Hastings, thence across the Missis- sippi river by the iron bridge or viaduct to Hastings, thence on the west bank of the Mississippi river in a southerly direction through the counties of Da- kota, Goodhue, Wabash, Winona and Houston, to La Crescent, including said iron bridge at Hastings, all in the state of Minnesota; with all lands and real estate used for railway purposes at and between the points above named, and all rails, fixtures, stations, depots, warehouses, shops, water tanks, turn tables, machinery and apparatus connected therewith and appurtenant thereto, in- to, including fifteen first-class locomotive engines, one hundred box cars and thirty-five flat cars, and all the rights and franchises of every description, of the party of the first part appertaining to the said line of railway, from St. Paul to La Crescent, necessary or requisite for the operation of the same, reserving therefrom all lands not used for railway purposes, owned or to be owned by the grantor, donated by the United States of America, or by the state of Minne- sota. &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 111 The following is a recapitulation of the bonded debt of the company: ..... Secured on 6 lines owned by the company…. On leased lines, assumed... $18,749, 500 16,589,000 Total...... Bonds of Nov. 30, 1872, secured on road owned, and part of leased lines.. $35, 338, 500 $48,000,000 &quot; &apos;Gross Earnings of Railways in 1873. 31 vices of its officers and employés are distributed in like manner. As the business of a given number of miles maintains no uniform relation to that of any other given number of miles, it will be seen that no just proportion of the cost, or result of operating can be given as belonging to the state of Illinois.&quot; The facts stated have an equal bearing as to proportion of cost and result of operating in Wisconsin. We call attention to the fact that a portion of the bonded debt of the Chicago and Northwestern company in Wisconsin, consists of a first mortgage upon the Northwestern Union Road, from Mil- waukee to Fond du Lac-a distance of 633 miles-amounting to $3,500,000. The bonds secured by this mortgage are sinking fund gold bonds-(at the rate of about $55,000 per mile)-the payment of which has been assumed by the Chicago and Northwestern Com- pany. [See Bill in Chancery-W. F. Pick et al. vs. Railroad Com- missioners—page xxx.] It is understood that this issue of bonds was made partially to cover the cost of the Lodi branch, no portion of which is yet constructed. ORIGINAL SUBSCRIPTIONS TO STOCK. In its report to Illinois for 1873, the officers of the Chicago and Northwestern Company say: &quot;This company has no record of subscriptions made to other companies now consolidated with this, but it is believed that the entire stock has been subscribed and paid in, amounting to $36,477,073.82.&quot; PASSENGER EARNINGS OF CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN. The report of the Chicago and Northwestern Company for the year ending May 31, 1873, presents valuable facts in connection with the subject of passenger earnings. The gain on passenger earnings for that year over the previous year, was 764 per cent., while the rate per passenger per mile for 1872, was 3.28 cents, against a rate for 1873 of 3.16 cents-a decrease of 3,66 or 12 of a cent per passenger. 100 per cent., The rate per passenger per mile under the present Wisconsin law, applicable only to passengers to and from points within the state, is 3 cents—a decrease of 1 of a cent per passenger from average rates charged by the road for the year ending May 31, 1873, and of .114 of a cent from rates charged by the road for the year ending Dec. 31, 1873. &apos; &quot;Remedial Measures. 123 ough than they have been heretofore. There may be cases in which an honest corporation, struggling through financial straits, would prefer that its exact condition should not be known to the world; and yet, even in such cases, the policy of concealment is one of very doubtful propriety or advantage, while the amount of injury that may be done to the public and to the credit of the state by encouraging less honorable corporations in the practice of secret frauds, may be very great. The fact must not be lost sight of that the state, to the extent of its power to prevent the practice of wrongs upon the public by the corporations of its own creation, is bound to regard the general welfare, future as well as present, rather than the tottering credit of one or more unfortunate corporations. If publicity through full reports should bring embarrassment in some cases for the present, it will also have a strong tendency to correct abuses and to induce a more healthy condition of bodies corporate in the time to come. • A proper report to stockholders will do more than make a show- ing of business done, earnings and liabilities. It will also give the reasons influencing the management to the course it has pursued and the principles which govern its action. These views find ample confirmation in the very able report of the investigating committee of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, recently published. In accounting for the existing distrust in the value of railway stocks and securities, the committee say: &amp;quot;And we suggest, as the first, the meagre and incomplete reports of the di- rectors of railroads made to the stockholders. Railway directors, in their re- ports, seem guided by the old adage-that &apos;the least said is soonest mended.&apos; There is a tendency to limit their reports to the general results of a year&apos;s work, giving financial results and the economic workings, while the stock- holders are left in great ignorance of the value of their own property. There should be, in every respect, the fullest detail of these items, enabling each stockholder, at the end of a year, to make his own estimate of the value of his stock. But these reports should go further and give the most ample infor- mation as to the position of the road in its relations with other roads, and state fully all the facts that might influence its policy, its plans for the future, or its finances.&amp;quot; MORE FREQUENT REPORTS. Much importance is justly attached by many authorities on rail- way matters to a greater frequency of reports to stockholders than is now common. It is manifestly proper that stockholders, where &quot; &quot;200 Report of Railroad Commissioners. SCHEDULE 2.-Depot Grounds. Omro and Winneconne $17,000 SCHEDULE 3.-Grading.

Company, with authority to construct a road from Milton, in the county of Rock, by way of Janesville, through the counties of Green, La Fayette and Grant, to some point on the Mississippi river to be selected by the corpora- tion, with all the usual rights, powers, privileges, immunities and franchises ordinarily conferred on such companies. Act approved April 7, 1852. Chap 99, laws of 1853, enlarges the powers of said company to construct its road, and make connections with the Galena and Southern Wisconsin Railroad Company, and with other roads and branches at the state line. Act approved March 19, 1853. Chap. 255, laws of 1853, authorizes the Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad Company to purchase a portion of the Southern Wisconsin Railroad, and to merge the same in its own incorporation, upon terms to be agreed upon. Act approved April 2, 1853. Chap. 334, laws of 1853, provides that in case of vacancies in the board of directors of the Southern Wisconsin Railroad Company from any cause, re- ducing the board below the maximum number, any five directors shall con- stitute a quorum, with authority, among other things, to fill such vacancies. Act approved July 5, 1853. Chap. 265, laws of 1854, authorizes the city of Milwaukee to loan its credit in aid of the Southern Wisconsin Company, in a sum not exceeding $300,000, upon the same conditions as to other similar companies. Act approved March 31, 1854. Chap. 320, laws of 1854, amends the charter of said company by granting additional powers, and provides by the appointment of commissioners, a mode of settling disputes in case of disagreements, as to the value of property taken, etc. Act approved April 3, 1854. Chap. 61, Laws of 1855, enlarges the power and franchises of said com- pany, authorizes it to sell and convey its property, both real and personal, of any kind or nature whatever, and to release to the Milwaukee and Missis- sisppi Railway Company its equity of redemption in so much of its road as lies between the village of Milton and city of Janesville, in Rock county. Act approved Feb. 17, 1855. MILWAUKEE AND HORICON R. R. CO. The Milwaukee and Horicon Railroad Company was incorporated by chap. 450, Laws of 1852. Nine commissioners were appointed, and the capital stock limited to $800,000. After organization and within ten years, the com- pany was authorized to extend its road from Fort Winnebago, or from some eligible point on Fox river to such point on the Mississippi river as might be agreed upon, and in that event to increase the capital stock to $2,000,000. The franchises granted otherwise are of the usual kind conferred upon rail- roads. Act approved April 17, 1852. Chap. 303, Laws of 1854, authorizes the county of Waushara, the town of Waushara, and certain towns in Fond du Lac and Marquette counties to loan their credit on the usual terms in such cases, in aid of the Milwaukee and Horicon Railroad Company. Act approved April 1, 1854. &quot; &apos;28 Report of Railroad Commissioners. Gross earnings for year ending May 31, 1873, $12,736,606.75, an amount over 20 per cent. of the total stock and funded debt. The operating expenses for the year ending May 31, 1873, were $7,776,168.13, or about 61 per cent. of gross earnings, and over 12 per cent. on total stock and funded debt. Adding an additional amount to operating expenses, for taxes paid by the company, and for renewals and expenses occasioned by the Chicago fire, of $402,068.58, and we still have a balance left for net earnings of $4,558,370.04, or nearly 7 per cent. on total stock and bonds. After deducting interest on bonds ($1,356,884.80), we have an excess of $3,201,495 24. From this excess (after payment of all interest on bonds), a dividend of 7 per cent. was paid on the preferred stock, and a further dividend of 32 per cent. on the common stock (amounting to $2,019,640.00), leaving a remainder from net earnings of From which remainder was paid- For sinking funds.

The accounts of these proprietary roads are kept separately, the parent road, or Chicago and Northwestern proper, paying any defi- ciencies and receiving any surplus arising from their operation, extension or repairs. The cost of the Winona and St. Peter road alone, represented by capital stock, bonds and unfunded debt, was reported by the Minnesota commissioners, Aug. 31, 1873, at $10,604,878.74. This road received a land grant estimated to include 1,500,000 acres— much of which was sold at $6.47 per acre. The Winona and St. Peter Company purchased 105 miles of this road of Danford N. Barney and others, and assumed a first lot of bonds equal to $20,000 per mile; issued bonds to the parties of the first part to the &apos; &quot;Executive and Legal Documents. 43 possibly be to stop the railway. I answer again that it ought to be stopped, for it passes where it does by wrong.

And it is not unimportant to observe that this broad English jurisdiction was well established and publicly recognized at the time of the adoption of our state constitution. It was, however, strenuously denied that it had been adopted in this country or could be upheld by the current of American authorities. We have not found this juristiction as directly and succinctly stated in American treatises as in English, although it is fully recognized by the best of our elementary writers. Judge Redfield says that &amp;quot;injunctions in courts of equity, to restrain railways from exceeding the powers of their charters, or committing irreparable injury to other persons, natural or artificial, have been common, for a long time, in England and this country.&amp;quot; 2 Redfield on Railways, 307. Nearly all the chapter of this work (ch. 39), from which we quote, is full of instruction on the question, and directly recognizes, especially in the valuable notes, the same jurisdiction of courts of equity in this country, both at the suit of private persons for private wrongs and of the Attorney General for public wrongs, as that exercised by the English chancery. Later in the chapter he says that the equitable jurisdiction by injunction goes upon the ground of nuisance. As, indeed, any intrusion upon public right is in the nature of pourpresture. The ancient jurisdiction to restrain nuisance, is perhaps the most direct ground of the modern jurisdiction under considera- tion. And the former is fully asserted as an American jurisdiction, as to remedies both by private persons and by the Attorney General for the public. 2 Story&apos;s Eq., sec. 920-923. The remedy by injunction, at the suit of private parties, for private wrong, is recognized and enforced in a great number of American cases. Gardner v. Newburgh, 2 Johns. Ch., 162; Belknap v.

There are more cases to the same effect; an unbroken line of decisions, of the most respectable authority, convering some half a century; most of them going on excess or abuse of corporate franchise, and all full sustaining equitable jurisdiction in case of private wrong. They seem to establish the jurisdiction of courts of equity in this country, as conclusively as it is estab- lished in England, of private suits to restrain private wrong arising from excess or abuse of power by corporations. In such cases, public wrong may be considered only as an aggregation of private wrongs. And, the jurisdiction once established to enjoin private wrong, in each case, at the suit of the person wronged, it is almost a logical necessity to admit the other branch of the jurisdiction, to enjoin, at the suit of the state, such a general wrong, common to the whole public, as interests the state, and could be remedied by private persons by a vast multitude of suits only, burthensome to each and impracticable for very number; more con- veniently, effectively and properly represented by the Attorney General as parens patriæ. But jurisdiction of informations of this nature has sometimes been denied here. Courts of equity in this country, singularly enough, being sometimes more timid to control corporate power, and less willing to protect 1 &quot; &quot;26 Report of Railroad Commissioners. where the distance on the first and last carrying line is twenty-five miles (or under), but the distance over the intermediate roads (of which there would be several) would be two hundred miles or upwards. Query. Would the first carriers be entitled to the arbitrary rate allowed for the first twenty-five miles. If not, why not? And how would the proportions of the other car- riers be determined? Does the law compel our road to pro rate with another in any or every case-say, for instance, on business from Wrightsville, situated on our line, only four miles from Green Bay Junction to Green Bay-the Green Bay and Minnesota road having a distance of one hundred and fifty miles? In such a case the shipment would originate with us. If we are obliged to pro rate are or would we be compelled to furnish a car to go through to Green Bay? And if we are not obliged under the law to pro rate with long lines, what divisions will the law permit us to take of through rates from one point to another, as if both were on the same line? And where is the authority there- for? While this company will hardly be prepared to adopt in every particular, the provisions of the act on the first of October, for the reason that we first desire light on the matter of construction to be placed upon some of the clauses, which, if taken literally, seem to be impracticable in themselves, still we trust that our course will be such as will satisfy the public as well as the state commissioners and other officials. We would like very much to talk with the commissioners, and, I am free to say, that I am sure a meeting would result to the benefit and satisfaction of all concerned. I trust they will be pleased to make an early trip to this place. Very respectfully, * * * * H. A. TENNEY, Esq., Clerk of the Board. W. G. SWAN, General Superintendent. THE COMMISSIONERS TO SUPT.

But it is impossible that under our popular institutions a continuance of the debased status of railroad corporations in the United States can be ex- pected. The Under the almost frantic desire of our people for their extension, all restraints were ignored or their application futile. The exper- ience of England seems to have been the same. The turning point was reached there and his now reached in the United States. question is what shall be the future relations of railroads and the government? We think as stated in the proposition heretofore given it is already indicated, and that the pre-existing relations of the people and the government will establish the char- ter and extent of state control. But it is not sufficient it does not meet the case which is already on our hands-to provide only against the evils of the future; we need to correct existing wrongs. It is robbery of the people to allow them to be perpetuated. We need the passage of laws to prevent future wrongs; but an imperative sense of justice demands. that existing ones should be corrected. Assumed values should be eliminated, and their future insertion prevented; the real state of railroad corporations be made known; their future concealment prevented: the present rights of the people vindicated, and their future secured. The power of the state is abundantly competent for the undertaking. RAILROAD DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. At present the actual powers of railroad directors practically vary considerably in different portions of the country, and in differ- ent companies. In some cases, they are chosen at large meetings of stockholders and succeed in holding the reins of corporate government firmly in their own hands, managing the affairs quite independent of both stockholders-who have learned to acquiesce in such assumption-and officers. But in the majority of instances, and especially in the case of the more powerful companies, their election is a mere formality, the choice having been made by the supreme power of the company centralized in the one man who `sits as president, and they are thenceforth chiefly useful in giving to stockholders and public a semblance of direction in their inter- est. Of course, where this is entirely true, the subordinate officers &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 201 Line from Rush Lake to Winneconne. SCHEDULES. STATIONS. 11, 12. 16. 18. 19. 13, 15. 21.

Chapter 448, laws of 1867, authorizes the county of Fond du Lac, upon pe- tition therefor, to loan its credit in aid of said railroad company, upon the usual conditions in such cases, to the amount of $90,000 in county orders, and for an extension of the line to Ripon, in the further sum of $60,000. Section 6 of said act limits rates of charges for transportation for the term of ten years, to wit: wheat in car loads, from the city of Fond du Lac and sta- tions east, within said county, to the city of Sheboygan, at a rate not exceed- ing five cents per bushel; and from all stations between the city of Fond du Lac and Ripon, and from said city to Sheboygan, at a rate not exceeding seven cents per bushel for transportation to Sheboygan; said rates to apply not only to said company, but to its successors, or to any company owning or operating said road whenever cars were run for the transportation of freight. Act approved April 10, 1867. Chap. 99, laws of 1868, authorized the city of Sheboygan to vote aid to said road in the sum of $15,000, in the form of city orders, upon condition that the road should be open for freight and passengers on or before the 1st day of October, 1869, and in case of failure said aid was not to be rendered. Act approved Feb. 22, 1868. Chap. 382, laws of 1868, authorizes said company to extend its road from the city of Fond du Lac to Ripon. Act approved March 5, 1868. Chap. 421, laws of 1868, authorizes said company to construct a branch road from some point on its line to be fixed by the directors, to the Fox river at or near the foot of Lake Winnebago, and extends all the powers of the franchises originally granted over such proposed extension. Act approved March 6, 1868. Chap. 459, laws of 1868, authorizes the county of Calumet to loan its credit to an extension of the road of said company from some point on its line to be legally designated, to the Fox river, below Lake Winnebago, in the sum of $150,000, upon substantially the usual conditions attached to charters in such cases. Act approved March 6, 1868. Chap. 85, laws of 1869, authorizes said company to extend its line of road from the city of Fond du Lac, via Ripon and Portage City, to the Mississippi river, and extends all the powers of the original charter and amendments to said proposed extension.

Chap. 203, laws of 1869, authorizes the towns of Green Lake, Mackford, Manchester, Kingston, and the village of Markesan in the county of Green Lake, to vote aid to the Sheboygan and Fond du Lac Railroad Company in such sums as the boards of supervisors or trustees should determine, the same to be submitted for approval to a vote of citizens resident in said towns, etc. Act approved March 5, 1869. Chap. 78, laws of 1871, authorizes any county or town through or into &quot; &quot;86 Report of Railroad Commissioners. with instalments on partially paid shares, amounting to $6,788.69. Farm mortgage land had been received by the latter company to the amount of $40,000, $31,000 of which had been sold and $9,000 hypothecated. The con- solidated company agreed to relinquish these mortgages to the grantors, and also to refund all cash installments upon stock subscribed in Washington and Fond du Lac counties, which agreement was fulfilled. By the act of consol- idation, the construction of eighteen miles of line from Milwaukee reverted to the Milwaukee and La Crosse Company, at a cost on settlement for work done and materials furnished, of $311,752.90. Other expenditures on the con- tract to Portage City, and for iron, depot grounds, buildings, docks, right of way, fencing, engineering and salaries, and for all other contingent expenses from commencement of operations, including interest, discount and commis- sions, had reached the sum of $714,930.95; making the total expenditures to December 31, 1854, $1,026,683.85. The receipts of the company had been as follows: Farm mortgages, $617,000; full paid stock, $273,800; installments on stock, 69,696.11; Milwaukee City Bonds, $314,000; sundries, $148,690.12. Total resources from commencement, $1,423,- 187.33, leaving balance on hand, $396,503 38, in addition to mortgage bonds of road from Milwaukee to Portage City, amounting to $950,000. There were also in the hands of the stock agents of the company, farm mort- gages in process of examination and registry, amounting to $150,000. The whole available resources for subsequent operations from these sources, and from unpaid stock, were estimated at $1,500,000. Iron for 33 miles had been purchased and delivered, and 8 miles had been completed. The property in- cluded 1 locomotive, 20 platform cars, one section of station building, and about 500 feet of dockage in Milwaukce. The Engineer estimated the cost of completing the grading and track to Horicon at $266,000. December 31, 1855, the road was in operation to Horicon-51 miles. The bed was thoroughly ballasted from Milwaukee to Hartford-34 miles; the right of way had been secured, 100 feet in width, to Beaver Dam; ample depot grounds had been obtained at every station, all of which, except at Milwaukee, were donated to the company; dock, warehouse, engine-house and machine shops had been completed at Milwaukee, and the road equipped with 12 locomotives, 10 first class passenger cars, 2 baggage cars with post- office car, 123 house freight cars, 70 platform cars and 22 sets of car wheels and axles. The expenditures of the road to December 31, 1855, including engineering, $38,109.22; right of way and fencing, $39,122.74; depot grounds, $88,268,96; construction, $1,110,677.18; buildings, $36,631.59; engine houses and machine shops, $15,453.75; rolling stock, $244,472.40; salaries, 24,255.15; incidental expenses (with charter and organization expenses), $36,014.86; expenses and liabilities incurred by consolidation with Fond du Lac Com- pany, $44,087.46; commissions, discounts and financial agencies, $206,870. Total, $1,883,963.31. The portion of this total of expenditures assigned to the eastern division, from Milwaukee to Portage City, was $1,787,650.10, and it was estimated that the completion of the eastern division would require an additional expenditure of $769,520--making total cost of eastern division, 95 &quot; &quot;94 Report of Railroad Comwiissioners. and one-half common, and no money. The same year, the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company agreed to guarantee, jointly with the Winona and St. Peters Company, the first mortgage bonds of the La Crosse, Trempealeau and Pres- cott Company, to an amount not exceeding $1,000,000, to aid the latter com pany to build a line from La Crosse to a point opposite Winona, 28 miles, and a bridge across the Mississippi river. January 1, 1867, the total length of finished road owned and leased by the company, was 647 miles, as follows: Milwaukee to La Crosse via Watertown, 196; Horicon to Berlin and Omro, 53; Watertown to Sun Prairie, 26; Mil- waukee to Prairie du Chien, 200; Milton to Monroe, 35; McGregor to Cresco, 66; St. Paul and Minneapolis to Owatonna, 71. The material and supplies on hand were valued at $580,329.59. The total property was represented as follows: Preferred stock, $7,370,900; common stock, $3,627,800; first mort- gage bonds, $4,592,000; second ditto, $1,488,000; real estate, $135,000. Total Milwaukee and St. Paul securities issued, $17,213,700. Not included in the foregoing amount were: Prairie du Chien Company&apos;s first preferred stock, $3,204,296; second preferred do., $841,400; common do., $99,000; mortgage bonds, $390,500. Total, $4, 535, 196. On McGregor and Minnesota line, com- mon stock, $138,500; mortgage bonds, $2,109,000, Total, $2, 247,500. Ad- ding all together, we have a total amount of stock and debt, for 647 miles of road, of $23,906,396-or $37,000 per mile. During the year 1867, the company came into permanent possession of the eastern division of the La Crosse and Milwaukee line, 95 miles, and 78 miles were added to the line between Cresco and Owatonna, making the total length of the road at the close of the year, 820 miles. No dividends were declared on either class of stock of the St. Paul Company, &amp;quot;all the net earnings being required to pay for new buildings and additional equipment for the road.” The cost of the road from McGregor to Minneapolis, 215 miles, was placed at $9,015,000—or over $41,000 per mile, mostly in bonds and stock. At the close of the year the company was engaged in constructing no new line, except an extension from Omro to Winneconne, five miles, at an estimated cost of $70,000, or $14,000 per mile. At Winneconne the company had received valuable donations of right of way and depot grounds. In November, 1868, the extension from Omro to Winneconne-5 miles- was completed at a cost of $82,600, making the total length of road 825 miles. December 31, 1868, the cost of the whole road, represented by total stock and debt, was stated at $32,552,341, or $39,457 per mile; the total increase for the year being $2,298,116, with an increase of five miles of road. The transfer of the Prairie du Chien line to the St. Paul company was formally com- pleted. The elevator buildings on the lands of the company at Milwaukee were purchased for $300,000 and leased to Angus Smith &amp;amp; Co., for five years, &amp;quot;at a price which will give the company a fair profit on the purchase,&amp;quot; the price made dependent on business done. The company also engaged during the year in constructing the line from Sun Prairie to Madison-a distance of about 12 miles; and the directors entered into contract to purchase or consol. idate with the McGregor and Sioux City Railway, from Calmar to Charles &quot; &apos;Laws Relating to Railroads. 291 Chap. 330, Laws of 1854, authorizes the company to build a branch road from some suitable point in the valley of Black Earth creek, in Dane county, to some convenient place at or near Sauk Prairie, in Sauk county. Act ap- proved April 3, 1854. Chap. 61, Laws of 1855, grants additional power to the Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad Company to extend its track from the city of Janesville westerly to the village of Monroe, in Green county, and through or near the villages of Shullsburg and Benton, in La Fayette county, to a point on the Mis- sissippi river, thence along the river to a point opposite or near Dubuque, in the state of Iowa, through the county of Grant. All rights, powers, privileges and franchiscs of the company are conferred on the proposed extension. The capital stock is authorized to be increased to a gross sum of $8,000,000, and the number of directors to a number not exceeding seventeen. Act approved Feb. 17, 1855. Chap. 66, Laws of 1856, repeals section 10 of the charter of the Racine, Janesville and Mississippi Railroad Company, approved April 17, 1852, and prohibits any interferences with the Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad Company in the construction of its road from Janesville to the Mississippi river. Act approved Feb. 29, 1856. Chap. 308, Laws of 1860, &quot;An act to facilitate and authenticate the forma- tion of a corporation by the purchase of the Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad Company,&quot; provides that in case of the sale of the road by fore- closure of mortgage or deeds of trust, the purchaser or purchasers or their assigns, if desiring to create a corporation, could do so by filing with the Secretary of State, a certificate specifying the name of the corporation and the names of directors for the first year, etc., and thereupon the new company should be vested with all the powers, privileges, immunities and franchise s of the old one. The stock basis of the new company was limited to $7,500,000. It was authorized to issue as many classes of preferred stock as there were mortgage liens upon the road, to an amount not exceeding $4,500,000, the dividends upon which were limited to 8 per cent. annually. The preferred stockholders of the first and second classes were authorized to elect the direct- ors until a dividend was earned on all of the preferred shares of the several classes, when all the preferred stockholders were to elect directors until a dividend was earned on all shares of the company. Thereafter all stockhold- ers were authorized to vote for directors. No debt or mortgage could be in- curred without a vote of two-thirds of the preferred stockholders. Current expenses were to be first paid, and a sinking fund of surplus earnings set aside, and dividends were not to be declared until the capital stock was reduced to six millions, and the earnings seven per cent. on all the stock of the company. Act approved March 31, 1860. Chapter 86, Laws of 1862, amends chapter 308, general laws of 1860, by re- pealing section 7, and confirming the articles of association of the purchasers of the Milwaukee and Mississippi Railroad Company, executed by officers of the old organization January 21, 1861, a copy of which was on file in the office of Secretary of State. Act approved April 5, 1862. &apos; &quot;Remedial Measures. 129 the annual problem is, how to get through with the stockholders&apos; meeting without debate; showing, at least, a lack of confidence in the shareholders. These persons must learn to submit to the unwillingness of the shareholders to abandon their right of judgment, though that judgment should be wrong, They also overlook the weightier and more important fact that, apart from the right which shareholders have to discuss all matters affecting their in- terest, the directors and officials, by this means, lose the profit and moral sup- port which shareholders, educated by a full discussion of the reports of the directors would give them. * * * * * * * * * * * &amp;quot;Fifth.-The tendency among railway stockholders to transfer the decision of all important questions to the board of directors. * * * * The existing relation in almost every large railway organization, will show that the shareholders are almost a nullity as to their influence in the policy or management of their own property-their main utility being in furnish- ing an audience to hear a report and voting for directors, a ticket being care- fully prepared for them. The evils of this are apparent, and it is time for the shareholders to resume, or more properly, assume the direction and control of their property.&amp;quot; While the report of the committee plainly sets forth some of the evils which have grown up in railroad management, and propose remedies to meet the case of their own company, having a working body of stockholders; the proposed remedies, (even from the state- ments made in the report), evidently could not be made operative in their application to a large part of the railroads of the United States, and particularly of those of the western states under their present status and management. The existence of the element des- ignated stockholders, being either a myth entirely, or else the rights inherent in them as the proper proprietors of the property are practically ignored or abandoned. It will be observed from the extracts given, that after a full ex- amination of the situation in which they find their company placed, and which necessarily included a comprehensive consideration of the general situation of railroad affairs in the United States, that the conclusions reached are entirely in harmony with those which have obtained ascendancy in England. The practicability of the improved relations between stockholder, manager and community, as set forth, has an important bearing upon the whole question, not only with reference to Wisconsin but to the whole United States. It will be observed that these relations are only possible under certain governing conditions, and such conditions are those which pertain to the legitimate financial basis of the company, and to the 9-R.

His Excellency the Hon. Wм. R. TAYLOR, Governor of the State of Wisconsin. DEAR SIR: The directors of the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Com- pany, having carefully considered the provisions of the two acts in relation to railroads, approved on the 11th and 12th of March last, desire to state the reasons why the roads they represent cannot be operated under the schedule named in the said acts. The rates prescribed therein average 30 per cent. less than those made by this company. To operate the Wisconsin lines has hitherto cost_us 70 per cent. of the gross earnings. The recent addition of the Madison Extension will carry the percentage still higher. Impose a reduction, then, of 30 per cent. in our earnings, and the working expenses could hardly be met; while the interest on the bonded debt, irrespective of any surplus for dividends, would be wholly unprovided for. This, in effect, would be a confiscation of the property. This company operates 566 miles of railway in Wisconsin. It was con- structed at a cost of $28,074,317.35. The actual cost of the 129 miles from Madison north to Winona Junction, without equipment, was $5,261,134.41, or $40,783.98 per mile. The line known and operated as the Wisconsin and Ke- nosha Divisions, between the Illinois and Michigan state lines, cost $13,521,601.47. The means for this vast outlay were advanced mainly by non- residents and foreigners. They were induced to make the investment on the assurance that the people who invited it, and whom it most benefited, would never render it precarious, nor deny the owners a voice in the management of their own property. The singular good feeling which has hitherto existed between the people of Wisconsin and this company has been to us a source of constant gratifica- tion. We have striven to maintain these harmonious relations, and have been extremely anxious to remove every just cause of complaint. The occurrence of a difference, however slight, is to us, then, especially, a matter of deep re- gret. And, were it possible to avoid it by a sacrifice even more than ordi- nary, we should not scruple to make it. But, when the concession involves our certain ruin, no alternative is left. The officers of this company have at all times been willing to accord any information regarding the operations of their road in Wisconsin. It might reasonably have been expected that, when so grave a measure as the arbitrary reduction of the company&apos;s tariff, without rule or reason, was contemplated, the parties most interested would have been requested to state what it cost them to do their business. Without that knowledge, it is manifestly impos- sible for any authority to fix an equitable tariff. This company would glad- ly have given the information had it been desired. They had ample reason to know precisely what their expenses were. They had laid, and arranged to lay, in their track, where traffic was heaviest and most constant, two hun- dred and fifty miles of steel rails—a more extensive improvement in that line than projected by any other company in the west. This one expenditure of about $3,000,000, necessitated a special increase in the bonded debt of the com- pany. Having no coal mines on this line of road, they were obliged to pay more than double price paid by Illinois companies for fuel. They had pur- chased fifty new locomotives from the best manufactories-among them six of the most powerful Mogul engines, for special service on the Tunnel Division, of the company&apos;s Madison Extension, where two of the largest engines are re- quired to haul one-half the load an ordinary locomotive can easily handle upon a comparatively level line. The 30 miles embraced in this Tunnel Division cost the company more to construct, and will cost it more to operate, than any 75 or 100 miles of the company&apos;s other property. Yet the tariff named in the act allows us no higher rates upon this division than upon the most favorably located line in the state. If enforced, they would compel us to operate that division at a positive loss. The same legislature which would ruinously de- crease our revenue, increased the taxes levied upon the company one-third. &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 121 Per mile.

THE COMMISSIONERS TO MR. WYATT. MADISON, May, 13, 1874. F. O. WYATT, Supt. Wis. Valley R. R., Tomah, Wis.: 66 DEAR SIR: We acknowledge, with pleasure, your letter of May 12th, to- gether with copies of &quot;freight and tariff No. 1,&quot; and of your passenger tariff to take effect April 28, 1874, from which it appears that your company not only intend to comply, but are complying with the law as to both freight and passenger tariffs. The spirit, as well as the language of your communica- tion, warrant the assumption that the new freight tariffs to be issued June 1, 1874, will also conform to that provision of the law which says: no individ- ual, company or corporation, operating, managing or leasing any railroad mentioned in class &quot;C,&quot; (to which the Wisconsin Valley Road belongs), in the first section of this act, shall receive a greater or higher rate for carrying freight than was received by said individual, company or corporation, for carrying such freight on the 1st day of June, 1873.&quot; [See sec. 5, ch. 273, Laws of 1874.] Thanking you for your prompt response to our inquiries, we have the honor to be, Very respectfully, By H. A. TENNEY, Clerk of the Board. J. H. OSBORN. GEO. H. PAUL, JOHN W. HOYT, Railroad Commissioners. • SUPT. L. A. EMERSON IN REPLY TO CIRCULAR No. 4. FOND DU LAC, WIS., May 12, 1874. Messrs. OSBORN, PAUL and HOYT, Railroad Commissioners, Madison, Wis. GENTS:-Agreeably to your request of the 8th inst., I send you herewith our latest freight tariff and classification which have been in effect since 1872. We are revising our classification and will make some slight changes in freight tariff. Any suggestions you may offer will be gratefully received and duly appreciated. I remain, yours very truly, L.A. EMERSON, Acting Superintendent. &apos; &quot;Railway Statistics. 79 taxes, $144.70; other expenses, including interest on capital stock, after deduct- ing net earnings, sufficient to make a total of $660,738.10-or about $17,000 per mile. The cost of road-bed and superstructure for the 38½ miles named, exclu- sive of engineering, right of way, incidental and contingent expenses, was placed at about $11,156 per mile. The cost of road-bed and superstructure of the 201½ from Milwaukee to Waukesha, exclusive of engineering, right of way and other contingent expenses, was placed at $11,400 per mile, and the engin- eering and other expenses at about $1,600 per mile. The cost of road-bed and superstructure for part of the road between Waukesha and Eagle Centre, 16½ miles, fully completed, exclusive of equipment, depot grounds and build- ings, was placed at $11,604 per mile. Sept. 29, 1851, the company contracted for the construction of the road to the east bank of Rock river, 31½ miles, for $12,000 per mile, one-half in bonds of the road, and one-half in cash. For this price the contractors were to build and complete the road-bed and super- structure, with frogs, switches, turn-outs, bridges, culverts, etc., ready for the running of the cars, furnishing all materials, iron and ties included, equal to those on the best portion of the road previously finished. The company was to provide gravel banks, right of way, and the usual motive power and cars for transporting materials only. The contract was subsequently modi- fied by the payment of cash in place of the bonds specified, at a discount of five per cent. At the close of the year 1852, the main line was completed from Milwau- keee to Milton, a distance of 62 miles, and a connection formed with Janes- ville by a branch road of 8 miles, constructed under the charter of the South- ern Wisconsin Railroad Company. Total road in operation, 70 miles. June 15, 1852, $600,000 of eight per cent. bonds were issued, secured by first mort- gage on the road from Waukesha to Rock river, and by second mortgage on the road from Milwaukee to Waukesha. The amount of the second mort- gage bonds was $74,000, and these were reserved to be used in exchange for the first mortgage bonds on the same portion of the road, so that the entire bonds outstanding should not exceed $600,000. The total paid subscriptions in stock up to Dec. 31, 1852, amounted to $734,369.87. Of this amount, $7,406.19, in partial payments for stock subscribed, had been forfeited to the company. The operating expenses of the year were 43½ per cent. of gross earnings. The cost of the whole road to Janesville, as far as then ascer- tained, was reported by the directors at $19, 494 per mile. The separate cost of the branch from Milton to Janesville, not including equipment, was given at $98, 968.18, or $12, 371 per mile. At this date the bonds of the company commanded a premium in market. The road was open to Eagle, 36 miles from Milwaukee, Jan. 22, 1852; to Palmyra, 42 miles from Milwaukee, Aug. 3, 1852; to Whitewater, 50 miles from Milwaukee, Sept. 24, 1852; to Milton, 62 miles from Milwaukee, Dec. 1, 1852, and to Janesville, about 70 miles from Milwaukee, Jan. 6, 1853. The equipment included 6 passenger cars, 35 eight-wheel box cars, 43 eight-wheel platform cars, 67 four-wheel gravel cars, 7 hand cars, and 9 locomotives. The cost of entire line to Janesville, as &quot; &quot;28 Report of Railroad Commissioners. sire to comply with the spirit of the law, I would be glad to have your opin- ion. Very truly, H. F.

COMMISSIONER OF General LanD OFFICE, WASHINGTON, D. C. DEAR SIR: I herewith enclose copy of a letter from General Hendricks to Gov. Randall, dated July 23, 1858. You will notice by it that the action of your department in the matter of the application of the La Crosse and Mil- waukee Railroad Company for lands under the act of the Wisconsin Legis- lature of October 11, 1856, and the grant of June 3, 1856 by congress, had been delayed in consequence of the interference of Gov. Randall until the 15th of August, 1858, when, if not heard from, action would be had by your depart- ment. Will you be kind enough to inform me what action was had? Were the lands applied for ever conveyed by the United States to the La Crosse and Milwaukee railroad Company, or its &amp;quot;Land grant Bond holders,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;trustees of purchaser,&amp;quot; and if so what were the names of the parties who re- ceived said lands, and also the number of acres to be received?

Very respectfully, J. H, OSBORN, Railroad Commissioner CHICAGO AND Northwestern RAILWAY, Office of the General Manager, Chicago, Nov. 9, 1874. DEAR SIR:-Your favor of the 6th inst., addressed to Mr. Keep, has been handed to me, with the request that I would reply to it. Up to this date, I have heard of no complaint of overcharge on our road, that has not been immediately corrected, excepting the one to which you refer in your letter. With so many stations in Wisconsin, and so many agents, errors are fre- quently made, as they were before the adoption of the Potter Law tariff, and the entire revision which has taken place in the tariff, tends to increase them, temporarily, until the agents learn this new mode of transportation. All errors, however, which come under my notice, I endeavor to immediately correct. The case you refer to was another mistake, and this company is ready to refund the overcharge. Had I known it in sufficient time, I should have in- structed the bill to be corrected. Probably one cause of overcharge has been a difference of opinion between the railroads on which the freight origi. nated, and the railroads who delivered it. The law, as I understand it, does not say how such earnings shall be divided between roads. The roads deliv- ering are apt to claim that the whole rate shall be at least pro rata. The roads receiving, knowing that in neither instance do the railroads get com- pensation for their work, claim they are entitled to their proportion under the Potter Law. I was to-day informed that the Commissioners or the courts of Wisconsin had decided that the through rate should be pro rated. Whether this is true or not I will thank you to inform me. I herewith enclose you copy of a Circular which I propose to issue at once, if the division of the rate between the roads is as you interpret it. Will you be good enough to telegraph me on receipt of this letter if this meets with your approval. I have to-day written our agent, Mr. Fitch, to refund the overcharge on the freight in the case you refer to. I am, dear sir, yours truly, H. H. PORTER, General Manager.. J. H. OSBORN, Esq., Chairman of Railroad Commissioners, Madison, Wis. &apos; &apos;Railway Statistics. 109 66 November 30, 1872, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company voted to issue bonds to the amount of $48,000,000, for the purpose of consolidating the varions outstanding debts for which said company was liable, and for equipping and completing &quot; the various lines of road described in the trust deed given for the security of the debt. These bonds become due December 1, 1902, bear semi-annual interest at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum, and both principal and interest are payable in gold. The lines upon which the trust deeds were given include all the lines owned by the corporation (as de- scribed on the second page preceding the last page 1, and also the Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska, and the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroads, extending from the east bank of the Mississippi river, opposite Clinton, to Council Bluffs, including the bridge across the Mississippi river at Clinton, with the branch railroad from Clinton to Lyons, Iowa, and which are leased to the Chicago and Northwestern Railway in perpetuity. Of the whole amount of these bonds, $8,955,000 were issued for the general purposes speci- fied, $18,749,500 were reserved to be issued in place of a like amount of any issue of said bonds which constituted at that date all of the outstanding debt of the company and the companies embraced in the consolidation; $16,599,000 were reserved to provide in like manner for the retirement of the bonds of other companies for which the Chicago and Northwestern Company is liable. The residue, $12,651,000, is claimed to have been expended, for the most part, for the construction and equipment of the roads of the company in Wis- consin. In addition to the roads mentioned in the last paragraph as leased to the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, that company owns all, or the greater part, of the stock of the following roads, which roads are leased to said company in perpetuity, and are operated and controlled by that com- pany by virtue of its interest therein: CHICAGO AND MILWAUKEE KAILROAD-From Chicago, Ill., to Milwaukee, Wis. LA CROSSE, TREMPEALEAU AND PRESCOTT RAILROAD-From a point near La Crosse, to a point on the Mississippi river opposite Winona, Minnesota. WINONA AND ST. PETER RAILROAD From Winona to Big Sioux River, in- cluding the Winona and St. Peter road in Dakota, the bridge across the Mississippi River at Winona, and the branch to Mankato, known as the Winona, Mankato and New Ulm Railroad. IOWA MIDLAND RAILWAY-From near Clinton, Iowa, to Anamosa. NORTHWESTERN UNION RAILWAY-From Milwaukee, Wis., to Fond du Lac, Wis. ST. CHARLES RAILROAD-From St. Chares, Ill., to Batavia Ill., and branch from Stanwood to Tipton, Iowa, known as &quot;the Stanwood and Tipton Railroad.&quot; Upon these roads the bonded debt assumed by the Chicago and North- western Company is as shown in the annexed table. &apos; &apos;36 Appendix. dictional word, manifestly inserted for the purpose of imposing a distinct duty on the court, only because we find it difficult to apply it. We must hold that the grant of the writ had a definite purpose. This is proved by the inde- pendent use of the word, rarely appearing in such a grant of jurisdiction. We may say that we have found it difficult to define the purpose; but if we should find it impossible to interpret the organic law of the court, we might not unjustly be held to confess our unfitness for this place. Receiving from the bar no solution of the difficulty which we could accept, we have patiently considered it, seeking light from the constitutional grant of jurisdiction itself, from the previous discussions of this court, and from the discussions of other courts on kindred subjects; steadfast to accept or re- ject jurisdiction of these causes, as our duty might be; and as far as we should be able, and as far as might be necessary to our decision, to ascertain and define the jurisdiction in question, for the future guidance of the court and the profession, until our construction shall be modified or changed by our successors. All the other writs of the group are common law writs. The writ of in- junction, when the constitution was adopted, was exclusively an equitable writ, used only by courts of chancery. As such it was given to this court, implying and carrying with it equitable jurisdiction to employ it. It is therefore plain that the original jurisdiction of this court is both legal and equitable, within certain limits; legal for the use of the common law writs; equitable for the use of the chancery writ. The use of the former must be according to the course of common law courts. The use of the latter, ac- cording to the course of courts of equity; in each case, subject to statutory modifications of the practice, which do not impair the jurisdiction granted. The common law writs, as already observed, imply and define the juris- diction appurtenant to them, as jurisdictional writs. It is otherwise with the writ of injunction. Equity has no jurisdictional writs. By the course of courts of equity, the jurisdiction must precede the writ. And though the writ is the end of the equitable jurisdiction implied, the scope of the juris- diction must be sought mainly outside of the writ itself. It can issue only after bill or information filed. And the question still remains, what is the original equitable jurisdiction conferred on the court, of bills or informa- tions, dependent on the use of the writ. The grant of original jurisdiction is one entire thing, given in one general policy, for one general purpose, though it may have many objects and many modes of execution. So it is of the appellate power. So it is of the super- intending control. There are three independent and distinct grants of juris- diction; each compact and congruous in itself; each a uniform group of analagous remedies, though to be exercised in several ways, by several writs, in legal and equitable proceedings, on many objects, in great variety of de- tail. The constitution wisely, almost necessarily, stopped with the general grants of jurisdiction, carefully distinguished, and left details to practice and experience. The grant is to the supreme court of the state, in the full significance of that term given in Attorney General v. Blossom; designed to have a general judicial oversight of the state in all its interests, public and private. To this court, as such, are given general appellate jurisdiction and superintending control over all other courts throughout the state, because these are essential to the judicial supremacy of the court in all ordinary litigation; and origi. nal jurisdiction of certain writs, &quot;because they are designed for the very purpose of protecting the sovereignty and its ordained offices from invasion or intrusion, and also to nerve its arm to protect its citizens in their liberties, and to guard its prerogatives and franchises against usurpation.&quot; This is the language of the court in Attorney General v. Blossom, which we adopt and approve as applicable to the question before us. And it tends to show, as the whole opinion in that case shows, that the three grants of jurisdiction pro- ceed on one policy; appellate jurisdiction to decide finally all ordinary liti- gation; superintending jurisdiction over all other courts to control the course of ordinary litigation in them; and, outside of these, original jurisdiction of certain proceedings at law and in equity, to protect the general interests and welfare of the state and its people, which it would not do, to quote Smith J. again, to dissipate and scatter among many inferior courts. Here are three juris- &apos; &quot;166 Report of Railroad Commissioners. ST. CROIX AND LAKE SUPERIOR RAILROAD-Statement of Stock and Debt-from Reports of the Company. YEAR. 1866. Length in Miles.

The railroad companies had received charters granting the most liberal powers, and the consti- tution of the state under which the grants of power were given, contained no reservation of authority to alter or amend. Thus secure in the exercise of their prerogatives, the railroads doubtless made exactions of the people in some cases which were unjust and oppresssive. The natural law of competition in which the public reliance was at first universal, had again shown itself to be utterly insufficient for the protection of the public. At last, the time came when, for many reasons, public opinion demanded a total revision of the constitution. This was effected in 1870, and not without due regard to the transportation interests; for by the con- stitution railroads are declared public highways, and the duty of establishing reasonable maximum rates for railroad transportation is imposed on the legislature. Power is also conferred upon the legislature to make laws prohibitive of unjust discrimination, with the severest penalties for violations of the laws enacted. As the Illinois constitution is peculiar in these respects, we quote so much of it as relates to this subject. It provides- First. That every railroad company doing business in the state shall main- tain a public office within the limits of the state, where stock books and other important records shall be kept for public inspection. Second. That &quot;the rolling stock and other movable property belonging to any company shall be liable to execution and sale in the same manner as the private property of individuals. Third. That &quot; no railroad company shall consolidate its stock, property or franchises with any other railroad corporation using a parallel or competing line;&quot; and in no case whatever, except upon public notice given, of at least 60 days, to all stockholders, in such manner as may be provided by law. Fourth. That a majority of the directors of any railroad shall be citizens and residents of the state. Fifth. That all railroads of the state shall be considered highways and free to all persons for the transportation of their persons and property, under such regulations as may be prescribed by law; and &quot;that the general assembly shall, from time to time, pass laws establishing reasonable maximum rates of charges for the transportation of passengers and freight on the different rail- roads of the state.&quot; Sixth, That &quot;no corporation shall issue any stock or bonds, except for money, labor or property actually received, and applied to the purposes for which such corporation was created;&quot; that &quot;all stock dividends and other fictitious increase of the capital stock or indebtedness of any such corpora- tion shall be void ;&quot; and that &quot;the capital stock of no road shall be increased &apos; &apos;186 Report of Railroad Commissioners. CASH VALUATION AND COST OF RAILROADS. CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE &amp;amp; ST. PAUL RAILWAY-PRESENT CASH VALUATION. MILWAUKEE, Dec. 26, 1874. To Jos. H. OSBORN, GEO. H. PAUL, JOHN W. HOYT, Railroad Commissioners: Your circular of September 28, 1874, asking this company &quot;to procure and submit to the Board a detailed estimate of the actual present value of the road or roads, and each branch or division thereof, if branches or divisions exist, under their control in this state,&quot; was received in due time. The actual present value of a railroad is a matter somewhat difficult to de- termine-resting largely in opinion, and susceptible of several different an- swers. One answer might be what it did actually cost; but your circular ex- cludes this construction of your question, for you say: &quot;such an estimate to be made regardless of original cost or capital, or debt incurred therefor.&quot; Another answer might be based on the income now derived from its opera. tion. And still another, on the basis of what it might earn or be capable of earning in the future, when the country is more fully developed; that is, its prospective value. But as we understand your circular, it is neither of these values you desire. The word present value appears to exclude the idea that you were inquiring for an estimate of the value of the road based on its pro- spective earnings; and as the present value, as based on its income, would depend largely upon the price it might charge for the business transacted, and the state now denies the company the right to fix such charges, we con- clude you are not asking for the present value of the road on any such basis. In your circular you say you desire us to specify separately the present estimated cash value of the real estate, right of way, grading and masonry, bridges, superstructures, station and other buildings, engines and cars, and every other sort of equipment and property belonging to each of said roads, and essential to their operation, respectively, as aforesaid.&quot; &quot;&quot; From this statement, it appears clear to us that what you desire us to re- port is, what it would now cost to produce these improvements in cash, with- in a reasonable time prior to the first day of January, A. D. 1874. Adopting this as a proper construction, we have caused an estimate of the property of this company in this state, to be made on this basis, which is herewith sub- mitted to your board. In your circular, you further request that &quot;such estimate be so made as to include a statement of the source of information, as far as may be, upon which the estimate in each case is based; whether upon actual observation by officers, or upon special surveys and calculations by engineers or others &apos; &apos;Official Papers and Correspondence. 9 In reply, I beg to respectfully state, that we have made no change in local rates since the line opened between Elroy and St. Paul, Nov. 25, 1872. With reference to through rates, will say, it has been customary for all lines run- ning from Lake Michigan ports (say, Chicago or Milwaukee to the Missis- sippi river), to issue a through tariff every spring, giving lower rates than those current during the winter months. This has been done to enable the dealers in St. Paul, Minneapolis, and at other principal points contiguous to the Mississippi Valley, to procure their goods at Milwaukee or Chicago, in competition with St. Louis and other lower sources of supply. Therefore, while our through rates of to-day are no higher in any case than those cur- rent on the first of June, 1873, they are in all cases materially lower than those in effect April 1, 1874, and during the previous winter months. I send you, herewith, a set of our tariffs, together with our classifications of freight, which you will find to give all desired information in detail, and also to illustrate the changes made from winter to summer schedules as here. in before referred to. In this connection, allow me to call the attention of your honorable board to the fact that, during the fall of 1873, when, acting under instructions from the full board of control, the local managers of other lines in the state prepared and put into effect, about September 15, advanced rates from all local points upon their respective roads, the West Wisconsin management, being composed exclusively of gentlemen whose entire personal interests are located in and identified with our state, were unable to recognize either the justice or expediency of making any advance; consequently, all rates current during the summer of 1873, were maintained intact during the moving of the heavy crops in the fall, and they are yet in force. I mention this fact as a matter of justice to this company other lines having recently restored their summer rates (of 1873), while we, having previously made no ad - vance, have not found occasion to make any reduction in order to place our rates upon a more equitable and satisfactory basis. You conclude your communication as follows: &quot;You will oblige us by furnishing the answers requested as early as practicable, sending us all print- ed sheets bearing upon the subject referred to in the questions, together with any written statements necessary to render the information asked for by us, full and complete.&quot; Perhaps you did not intend to call out any information not directly bearing upon the subject of rates; but as your language admits of a wider interpre- tation, I cannot pass the opportunity without attempting in an informal way to place before you for consideration some general information respecting this road; its construction; cost of operating, net revenue, etc., that, in our opinion, directly bears upon its relation to the country through which it passes, to its patrons upon whom it depends for its support, and to the state, from which it received such of its powers, franchises and privileges as gives to it a corporate existence, and enables it to hold and use its property-only subject to such wise and required legislation as the state may, under consti- tutional limitations, choose to prescribe. &apos; &quot;42 Report of Railroad Commissioners. ROADS RECENTLY CONSTRUCTED. The new roads have been examined with much interest and con- siderable satisfaction. The Wisconsin Central, Green Bay and Minnesota, Lake Shore and Western, Northwestern Union, West Wisconsin, Wisconsin Valley and North Wisconsin, though among the cheapest that have been built, are among the best in construc- tion. As a general thing, they are ironed with rail of light weight, but in respect of road-bed, tying, bridging, etc., they are quite equal to the best of new western roads. Financially speaking, they are all of them constructions in ad- vance of the paying point. Probably few of them now pay their expenses out of their earnings, and still have enough to pay the in- terest on their indebtedness, saying nothing of dividends on stock. On the other hand, it cannot be urged that they were built out of time. They were a necessity to the sections of state accommodated by them, and are also an advantage to the whole state; some of them opening new channels of traffic for competing companies, and others penetrating entirely new portions of the state, thus ensur- ing their early settlement, and making their extensive resources available for the more rapid advancement of the whole common- wealth. CONSTRUCTION DURING 1874. Notwithstanding the stringency of the times, and the extraordi- nary depression felt by the railroad interest, the past year has made record of the following new constructions in Wisconsin: Wisconsin Valley extension to Wausau... North Wisconsin extension.... Miles. Chippewa Valley Railway between Eau Claire and Chippewa Falls. 11 Galena and Southern Wisconsin, State Line to Platteville.... Total miles new road.... ||| ដ៖ម The Wisconsin Valley extension was completed and opened in December. Besides giving the people of Marathon county an out- let long needed, it has given the company a very important advant- age by securing to it a large lumber traffic over the whole of its line, and become the channel of a considerable business in the way of shipping goods and supplies of various kinds to the lumbering region tributary to Wausau. The road is built in a creditable manner, and appears to be managed with efficiency and economy. &quot; &quot;202 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

That it must be understood as intended to guard against a power of at least doubtful utility, the abuse of which had been extensively felt, and to restrain the legislature in future from violating the right to prop- erty. That anterior to the formation of the constitution, a course of legisla- tion had prevailed in many, if not all, of the states, which weakened the con- fidence of man in man, and embarrassed all transactions between individu- als, by dispensing with a faithful performance of engagements. To correct this mischief by restraining the power which produced it, the state legisla tures were forbidden &apos;to pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts,&apos; that is, of contracts respecting property, under which some individual could claim a right to something beneficial to himself; and that, since the clause in the constitution must, in construction, receive some limitation, it may be con- fined, and ought to be confined, to cases of this description; to cases within the mischief it was intended to remedy. &amp;quot;The general correctness of these observations cannot be controverted. The framers of the constitution did not intend to restrain the states in the regula- tion of their civil institutions, adopted for internal government; and that the instrument they have given us is not to be so construed, may be admitted. The provision of the constitution has never been understood to embrace other contracts than those which respect property, or some object of value, and confer rights which may be asserted in a court of justice.&amp;quot; If property, as the great Chief Justice indicates, be the test, it might well be said that aggregations of persons in municipal corporations may have rights of property as clearly as aggregations of persons in private corpora- tions, and come as well within the prohibition. So the court afterward found in East Hartford v Hartford Bridge Co., 10 Howard, 511, and other cases, in which the court disregards the property test, and rests the application of the rule on the distinction between public and private corporations. See Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, 11 Peters, 420. And so of offices, it might well be suggested that the emoluments of public office, conferring rights which may be asserted in a court of justice, may logically come within the property test. Mr. Justice Story, another great name which has reflected its lustre on this decision, says: &amp;quot;Another division of corporations is into public and private. Public corporations are generally esteemed such as exist for public purposes only, such as towns, cities, parishes and counties; and in many respects they are so, although they involve some private interests; but, strictly speaking, public corporations are such only as are founded by the government for pub- lic purposes, where the whole interests belong to the government. If, there- fore, the foundation be private, though under the charter of the government, the corporation is private, however extensive the uses may be to which it is devoted, either by the bounty of the founder, or the nature and objects of the institution. For instance, a bank created by the government for its own uses, whose stock is owned exclusively by the government, is, in the strictest sense, a public corporation. So an hospital created and endowed by the govern ment for general charity. But a bank whose stock is owned by private per- sons, is a private corporation, although it be erected by the government, and its objects and operations partake of a public nature. The same doctrine may be affirmed of insurance, canal, bridge and turnpike companies. In all these cases, the uses may, in a certain sense, be called public, but the corpo- rations are private; as much so as if the franchises were vested in a single person.&amp;quot; It is difficult, at this day, to recognize the sound policy of this strict dis- tinction between municipal and all classes of quasi private corporations, or to appreciate the wisdom which admits the necessity of legislative control over all municipal corporations of every grade and nature, and denies it to all other corporations of every grade and nature. It is quite safe to say that, in this state of Wisconsin, each of these defendants, a private corporation for the purposes of this rule and placed by it above legislative control of its franchises, directly exercises, to say nothing of its indirect influence, more power over the public interests of the state, over the public welfare and pros- perity of the state, over the commonwealth, than the largest municipality in the state with its 90,000 or 100,000 souls, The state entrusts it with the exer- &quot; &quot;128 Report of Railroad Commissioners. sylvania Railroad Company at a meeting held March 10, 1874. They appointed a committee from their own number to investigate the affairs of the company, make an appraisment of the roads, shops, machinery, real estate, depots, bonds, stock and all other assets of the company, etc., etc. A report of 240 pages was the result, and besides the valuable statistics in regard to the property of the com- pany it presents views in regard to the management of railways, which have a direct bearing upon the main problem which is sought to be solved; and although the views presented by the committee are from the stand point of the stockholder, yet they are suggestive of very many requirements necessary to meet those conditions which the relations of railways with the public render imperative in order to a proper accord with the principle of non-interference to the greatest extent practicable; and in conformity with the spirit of our system of government. We have therefore made copious ex- tracts from the report. } &amp;quot;There exists in the public mind a want of confidence in railway stocks as a means of permanent investment. It is feared by some that all moneys invested in railway stocks will ultimately be sunk and lost from the operation of the causes we will notice. This state of hesitation and doubt should not exist. There is no reason for it in the character of the investment. Well- located and well-managed railways will pay good dividends on the amount in cash invested in them. The causes of this want of confidence must then ex- ist outside the nature of the case. Let us examine and find out, if possible, what they are; and we suggest as the &amp;quot;First.-The meagre and incomplete reports of the directors of railroads made to the stockholders. Railway directors, in their reports, seem guided by the old adage, &apos;that the least said is the soonest mended.&apos; There is a ten- dency to limit their reports to the general results of a year&apos;s work, giving financial results and the economic workings, while the stockholders are left in great ignorance of the value of their own property. There should be, in every report, the fullest detail of these items, enabling each stockholder, at the end of the year, to make his own estimate of the value of his stock. But these reports should go further and give the most ample information as to the position of the road in its relation with other roads, and state fully all the facts that might influence its policy, its plans for the future, or its finances. &amp;quot;Second. The tendency in the leading officials and managers of railroad companies to act as if the property they manage was their own. This is natural. Strong men, with their natural self-reliance, and from their more intimate knowledge of the particular interests of a company, are apt to as- sume the infallibility of their own judgment, and therefore grow impatient, and come at last to look upon a stockholder who may ask a question, or pre- sume to criticse their conduct or plans, as an impertinent intermeddler, and &quot; &quot;Records of Railway Companies. 109 Stockholders voting in the affirmative—continued.

These lines now neither receive nor expect to receive any present return for their expenditure, by whatever standard of honesty or economy that expenditure is measured. The initiation and successful completion of these enterprises are vital to the progress of our commonwealth. Their projectors look to the future alone, for that compensation to which all capital is entitled for legitimate invest- ment, and a wise and magnanimous people will not consciously consent to any violation of their equitable privileges. The present law is peculiarly and unquestionably oppressive and deterimental as to all roads of this kind. Reference to the statistics accompany- ing this report, will confirm and enforce this conclusion. The restrictions imposed not merely tend to delay the completion of lines already in operation, but without affording relief for any evi- dent wrong, manifestly discourage or absolute by paralyze all efforts for the development of further enterprise of the same character. Such modifications of the existing law should be made as, would relieve these lines of the burdens of which they now complain, without exempting them from such general supervision as would protect the public from the otherwise possible consequences of present or future mismanagement. 2. The law not sufficiently elastic. As said before, we cannot, subscribe to the opinion that it is wise to attempt interference with the details of management. On the contrary, we regard the method of the present law, in the respects stated, as too arbitrary and unyielding. The limits of this report do not permit us to specify many considerations by which this con- viction is enforced. One general fact in this place will illustrate many of a similar character. From August 20, 1873, to November 10, of the same year, the receipts of wheat in the Milwaukee mar- ket, mostly by rail, were about 12,000,000 bushels. From August 20, 1874, to November 10, of the same year, the receipts of wheat at Milwaukee were about 6,000,000 bushels only. Whether the principle of the present law, in its method of reg- ulating freights, is not obnoxious to the objections intimated, is a question of fact that deserves your serious consideration. Is it. necessary, in order to protect the public from the evils of bad man- agement or extortion, that the mutable, intricate and complicated. &quot; &quot;Records of Railway Companies. 123 ARTICLES OF CONSOLIDATION. WISCONSIN &amp;amp; SUPERIOR RAILROAD CO., AND CHICAGO, ST. PAUL &amp;amp; FOND DU LAC RAILROAD CONSOLIDATED. [On file with Secretary of State.] Articles of consolidation made and entered into this thirtieth day of March, A. D. one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five, between the Illinois and Wis- consin Railroad Company, a corporation created and existing by and under the authority of the laws of the state of Illinois, for the purpose of construct- ing, operating and maintaining a railroad in said state, party of the first part, and the Rock River Valley Union Railroad Company, a corporation existing under and by the laws of the state of Wisconsin, for the purpose of construct- ing, maintaining and operating certain railroads in said state of Wisconsin, of the second part. WHEREAS, heretofore, that is to say on the twenty-fourth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five, all that portion of the said railroad bed, rolling stock, franchises and property of every description of the said Rock River Valley Union Railroad Company described, embraced in a cer- tain indenture of mortgage made by said Rock River Valley Union Railroad Company to Robert J. Walker, bearing date on the ninth day of September, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one, being all that part of the line of said railroad, from Fond du Lac on Lake Winnebago, to the southern boun- dry of the state of Wisconsin, together with all the appurtenances, franchises and property of said company, moveable or immoveable, in any way con- nected under and by virtue of said mortgage to William B. Ggden, of the city of Chicago, and John H. Hicks and Charles C. Walden, of the city of New York, which said purchase of said portion of said railroad and its appurte- nances and property at said mortgage sale was made for the benefit and inter- est of said bond holders, under and by virtue of certain instruments signed by said bond holders, and copies whereof are hereto annexed, and WHEREAS, the railroads of the said Illinois &amp;amp; Wisconsin Railroad Compa- ny, and said Rock River Valley Union Railroad Company, including the said portion of said Rock River Valley Union Railroad, which was purchased as aforesaid by said William B. Ogden, John H. Hicks and Charles C. Wal- den, connect with each other at the north line of said state of Illinois, and the roads of said companies by said connection form a continuous line of railroad to the full extent of the lines of said respective railroads as the same are authorized by the laws and enactments of the said states of Illinois and Wisconsin, and WHEREAS, It is desirable that all the lines of railroads and purchases of the said two companies, including as well the portion of said Rock River Valley Union Railroad and its franchises, so as aforesaid purchased at the said sale had under the said mortgage as the portion thereof and of its fran- chises not embraced in said mortgage and sale, should be consolidated and brought under the management and control of one board of directors; and WHEREAS, The said William B. Ogden, John H. Hicks and Charles C. Walden, the purchasers aforesaid did, by an instrument in writing, bearing date the twenty-fourth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and fifty- five, a copy of which is hereby duly annexed, executed under their hands and seals, according to the provisions of an act of the legislature of the state of Wisconsin, approved March tenth, one thousand eight hundred and fifty- five, consent that the said board of directors of the said Rock River Valley Union Railroad Copany, parties of the second part hereto, should remain in possession of and direct the affairs and control the property of the said com- pany in the same manner as they might or could lawfully do if the sale of said portion of said road and purchases had not taken place; and WHEREAS, The said parties of the first and second parts have by their re- &quot; &quot;58 Report of Railroad Commissioners. To this total might be added, properly enough, the 1,500,000 received by the Northern Pacific, directly from congress. In such case the total becomes 9,965,500 acres. We do not find either that the state attempted to protect the rights of the people in reference to these lands, or that railroad companies upon whom they were conferred have so used them as to reduce the cost of the roads. Let us see whether Wisconsin has been more faithful in the execution of her trust. By the report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office for 1873, the total quantity of land which would be received from grants to aid railroads in Wisconsin was 3,412,358, table, p. 242.] acres. [See The value placed by the United States upon the alternate even sections being $2.50 per acre, that is the minimum given at which these lands can be estimated, but it is believed that the actual value of these lands should not be placed at less than double that sum, or a total of $17,061,791.05, and that it will probably very much exceed this amount. These grants of land were placed at the disposal of the state with a view to the reduction of the absolute cost of railroads to the peo- ple, and thus encourage their construction. Such being the case, it would seem that an essential condition on which the lands were donated would require the exercise of a supervisory care over the manner of their application on the part of the state, in order to certain that they were not diverted from the objects intended, and the interests of the people neglected. By a singular oversight no such provision seems ever to have been adopted. The grants were handed over to the several compa- nies on the simple condition that their respective roads should be constructed. In the case of the grant of 600,000 acres received by the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company to aid in the construction of that part of its road extending from Fond du Lac to the Michigan state line, taking the appraisal of that company itself for the first 240 sections ($12 per acre), and estimating the value of the balance at only $5 per acre, we have a valuation sufficient to yield almost $35,000 per mile for the whole distance to which the grant applies. When we consider that this company applied for and received still further aid from municipal corporations on the line of the road, it &quot; &quot;Executive and Legal Documents. 21 That said defendant has also issued to its agents and servants&apos; instructions to charge, demand and receive of all persons passing over their road or ship- ping freights thereon, the rate and compensation therefor on the several tar- iffs and schedules so issued by said defendant, which said last mentioned rates and compensation are different and higher and greater than those fixed, limited and authorized by said last mentioned act of the legislature, and that the said defendants, its agents and servants, have, during all the time since the said 28th day of April, 1874, charged, demanded and received of persons carried on their said railroad and of persons shipping freights thereon, to be carried between places within this state, rates and compensations therefor greater and higher than those fixed and authorized by said last mentioned act of the legislature. And the plaintiff further shows, upon information and belief, and so al- leges the facts to be, that said defendant has ever since the said 28th day of April, 1874, used and operated its railroad within the state of Wisconsin in entire disregard and violation of the provisions of said last mentioned act of the legislature, and has been and is daily and habitually charging and re- ceiving greater and higher rates and compensations for the transportation of freights and passengers upon its said railroad within this state than are fixed, established and allowed by said last mentioned act of the legislature; and that said rates are so charged and received by said defendant as aforesaid for carrying freights which do not come from beyond the boundaries of the state, to be carried across or through the same. And the plaintiff further shows, upon information and belief, that on the 9th day of May, 1874, the said defendant charged and received of E. B. Dean, of the city of Madison, the sum of one dollar and five cents for a ticket over its said road from Madison to Merrimac in the state of Wisconsin, the dis- tance between said last mentioned places being twenty-six miles; and on the last mentioned day charged and received of the said Dean the sum of one dollar and five cents for carrying him over their road as a passenger from Merrimac to Madison aforesaid, the distance of twenty-six miles, which sums were respectively higher and greater than the sums and rates fixed for said service respectively by the said last mentioned act of the legislature. And the plaintiff further shows, upon information and belief, that on the 8th day of May, 1874, the said defendant charged and received of Andrew R. Mosher, of the city of Madison, the sum of one dollar and ninety cents for a ticket over its road from Madison to Beloit in the state of Wisconsin, the dis- tance of forty-seven miles; that said Mosher applied to the agent of said de- fendant at Madison to check his trunk to Beloit; that said agent refused to do so until the said Mosher paid the sum of one dollar and ninety cents, who paid the sum under protest; that the said sum was so charged and received by said defendant for carrying the said Mosher as a passenger on its railroad from Madison to Beloit, a distance of forty-seven miles, within this state, in violation of the provisions of said last mentioned act of the legislature. And the plaintiff further shows that the said defendant has, by the several acts, omissions and doings herein charged and set forth, violated the provis- ions of said act of the legislature, and has offended against the provisions of the same and of the several acts creating and altering said corporations, and has exercised franchises and privileges not conferred upon it by law, and has thereby forfeited its privileges, franchises and charter as a corporation. Wherefor the plaintiff prays and demands that the charter of the said de- fendant and the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company be vacated, the existence of said corporation annulled, and that all the rights, franchises, powers and privileges conferred upon the said defendant, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, by the laws of this state, may be adjudged and declared to be forfeited, and that the said defendant be excluded from all corporate rights and privileges, and that said corporation, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company be dissolved, and for the costs of this ac- tion.

They are doubtless in the way of settlement, but they are not settled. Indeed, as we have seen, scarcely any two states or countries fully agree as to either of them. One is trying full ownership by government, the state working the roads. Another prefers government ownership, the roads being leased to private corporations. Another, mixed ownership, the state owning and operating, or leasing, a part of the roads, and allowing companies to operate the rest. Another charters compa- nies, assists them with money, and puts them under ministerial re- straint, not only forbidding but preventing competition. Another creates companies and leaves them to carry on the business of transportation pretty much as they like, but concentrates the best thought and the largest powers of the government deemed judi- cious, upon the matter of consolidations, with a view to prevent them. And yet others practice upon the theory of total non-inter- ference. GENERAL FAULT OF PAST RAILWAY LEGISLATION IN THIS COUNTRY. A leading and prevailing fault of the American treatment of the railway question has been a blind adherence to pre-conceived no- tions, regardless of either philosophy or experience. If the insuffi- ciency of the natural restraints, self-interest and competition, could not be determined a priori, it would still seem that successive and complete failures, running through a period of forty years, should have satisfied us of the futility of such a reliance. Perhaps we should have said, rather, our chief fault has been that, not until very lately, after we had already authorized and procured the building of a more extensive system of railways than that of all Europe, have we so much as had a question of railway control among us? The only question has been, How are we to get the roads we want? To be able to answer this, the people have knocked loud and long at the door of congress and of all our legislative halls; enthusiasts and speculators have taxed their inventive genius for the preparation of attractive schemes; steady men, of sound mind and solid means, have turned themselves into staunch pro- moters; plain, honest farmers have become railway directors and skilful lobbyists; counties, towns and municipalities have burdened themselves for many decades by extraordinary taxation; and thou- sands upon thousands of pioneer yeomen have put fatal mortgages upon their only earthly possessions. &quot; &quot;220 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

To illustrate its effect upon this company in this particular trade, let me briefly state the case. We have a road from Oshkosh to Monroe, and prior to the passage of the Potter Law were doing a fair and remunerative busi- ness in carrying between these points in connection with our general busi- The Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company have a road part way from Oshkosh to Monroe, and by using their road from Oshkosh to Janesville, and then transferring to our road for the balance of the dis- tance, a somewhat shorter line is obtained than to take our line for the whole distance. The freight is now the same to the shipper whatever route is taken; but under the Potter law as now administered, although our line from Janesville to Monroe constitutes one third of the distance from Fond du- Lac, and nearly one third from Oshkosh, yet it is claimed that we are entit- led to only two dollars for transporting a car-load of lumber from Janesville to Monroe, and this is all we have received since the injunction was granted; and out of this two dollars we are compelled to pay the Northwestern Com- pany sixty-eight cents for our services. To state the case, the Potter Law allows for hauling a car load of lumber from Oshkosh to Monroe, $20.50. Of this amount the Northwestern claims that they are entitled to $18.50 for hauling to Janesville, and sixty-eight cents for the use of their car over our road to Monroe, making $19.18, which leaves $1.32 as the compensation of this company for hauling from Janesville to Monroe and returning the empty car.

All necessary agreements to carry out the conditions aforesaid, shall be made. The value of the work done and materials furnished shall be estimated by the chief engineer of the consoli- dated company, and in case of dissatisfaction, by three experts, one of whom shall be such engineer.

That the said com- pany has executed an instrument purporting to convey in trust for such scrip- holders, all right, title and interest in and to the grant of said land aforesaid. That in case the said instrument shall be or at any time become ineffectual to transfer the same, the said consolidated company shall cause to be executed all proper instruments and writings, which in the opinion of counsel learned in law, shall be deemed necessary to carry into effect the true intent and mean- ing of such instrument. In case the land grant appertaining to the section of road of the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company, reaching from Portage to Ripon shall be acquired by the said consolidated company, the same when fully earned by the construction of the road, shall belong to the said consoli- dated company, and not to the section between Portage and Oshkosh, exclu- sively. &quot;&quot; Article Tenth. The existing obligations and liabilities heretofore entered into, assumed or agreed to by either of the parties of the first or second part hereto, shall be faithfully observed, fulfilled and discharged by the consoli- dated company hereby created.

Third. That the said directors may subscribe for, take, receive and hold re- spectively, shares of stock or land mortgage bonds at the market value there- of, in or issued by said company, at the appraised value thereof, if the same be not mortgaged as herein provided, or portions and amounts of each suffi- cient in amount to reimburse the expenditures made by them in carrying into effect the conditions hereafter, excepting the amounts that may be paid there out of the fund credited to the several divisions of road as hereinafter provid- ed, the amount of such shares of stock, or of bonds or lands so to be taken and held, to be determined and certified by the trustee or trustees of said company. Fourth. The cost of the procuring and depositing of the aforementioned bonds and stock, shall be chargeable to and paid out of the fund belonging to the said several divisions of road to the credit of which such bonds and stock may be deposited. Fifth. In case any one of the persons herein named as first directors of said consolidated company, shall refuse to act as such directors, or shall fail to comply with any of the conditions or obligations herein contained or imposed, such neglect or failure for thirty days after notice as prescribed by the board of directors, shall be taken and deemed as a resignation of his said office, and &quot; &quot;72 Appendix. territorial charter was not organized until after the adoption of the state con stitution, he will be at liberty to renew his motion as to the road now excluded from the injunction. If the Chicago &amp;amp; Northwestern Company should make it appear that one of the roads now included in the injunction was organized under the general railroad act of 1872, they will be at liberty to move to dissolve the injunction as to such road. But if such motions should be made, they will be heard only on the par- ticular ground reserved in each case in this opinion. No statute could have force to abolish any writ given to this court by the constitution, as it existed when the constitution was adopted. And, as our jurisdiction was founded on the writ of injunction, we think it better practice in such cases to send out the writ itself.

Salem, 103 Mass., 138, was an information in the na- ture of quo warranto against a municipal corporation for failure of duty. The court holds that the remedy does not lie in the case, for reasons not pertinent here. It was, perhaps, a case for mandamus. Having so decided the case, Morton, J., adds: &amp;quot;But the plaintiffs urge that this proceeding may be treated as a proceeding for general relief on the equity side of the court. If the necessary amend- ments were made to change it into an information or a bill in equity, we are of opinion that it still could not be sustained. Whether, in this state, in the absence of any express grant of jurisdiction, the attorney general can bring a bill of equity to redress any public wrong or grievance, need not be decided. It is clear that such a bill cannot be sustained for a private wrong. In this case, the grievance complained of is not a public wrong, in which every sub- ject of the state is interested; and therefore cannot be redressed by a public prosecution or proceeding.&amp;quot; This was only a refusal to pass upon the question, because the question was not before the court. The refusal certainly implies a doubt, very much such as that suggested by the supreme court of Connecticut. But the doubt, even of such respectable tribunals, cannot weigh against so much solid authority. The Attorney General v. Tudor Ice Co., 104 Mass., 239, was an information on the relation of a private person, to restrain the defendant from trading out- side of its franchise. The court says: &amp;quot;The Tudor Ice Co. is a private trading corporation. It is not in any sense a trustee for public purposes. The acts complained of are not shown to have injured or endangered any rights of the public, or any individual or other corporation, and cannot, under any legal construction, be held to con- stitute a nuisance.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;No case is therefore made, upon which, according to the principle of equity jurisprudence and the practice of this court an in- junction should be issued upon an information in chancery.&amp;quot; This disposes of the case. But the court proceeds to quote, with implied approbation, Att&apos;y Gen. v. Utica Ins. Co., infra, and Att&apos;y Gen. v. Reynolds, 1 Eq. C. Abr, 131; and to make this comment on later English cases: The modern English cases, cited in support of the information, were of suits against public bodies or officers exceeding the powers conferred upon them by law, or against corporations vested with the power of eminent domain, and doing acts which were deemed inconsistant with the rights of the public.&amp;quot; Without stopping to consider the accuracy of this comment, we content ourselves with the remark that no doubt is implied of the jurisdiction of such informations as those now before this court. After some particular comments on certain English cases, the court pro- ceeds to state the position of Massachusetts on this question, thus: &amp;quot;However that may be, by our statutes the general equity jurisdiction of this court is limited to cases where there is no plain, adequate and complete remedy at law, as well in suits by the commonwealth as those brought by private persons. Gen. Stat., ch. 113, sec. 2.&amp;quot; This shows that the court seems to think their jurisdiction in such cases, crippled by statute. Aud yet that court has, not only in the cases above cited, sustained private suits within the jurisdiction in question, but appears to have acted on the public branch of that jurisdiction in several cases. It is true that they are cases of nuisance, but they seem to us to be within the broad principles laid down in England and in this country. Att&apos;y Gen. v. Bos- ton Wharf Co., 12 Gray, 553; Dist. Att&apos;y v. Lynn and B. R. R. Co., 16 Gray, 242; Commonwealth v. Smith, 10 Allen, 448. The case in 16 Gray appears to us fully to support the jurisdiction of equity to restrain corporations from excess or abuse of franchise. Other cases outside of New York were cited against the jurisdiction; but on examination we cannot consider any of them as having bearing and weight upon the question. But the cases in New York require considera- tion. In that state the authorities are conflicting, and do not appear to us to rest on distinct and settled principle. We have already cited several cases decid. ed by Chancellor Kent and other judges, sustaining the private remedy in equity against nuisance, and one case sustaining the public remedy. And 4-R. R.-App. &quot; &quot;Remedial Measures. 105 MANNER OF EXERCISING STATE SUPERVISION, Having thus disposed of the question of form of state interfer- ence in the affairs of railway companies, we come now to a consid- eration of the way in which state supervision should be applied. It is a fundamental principle of free government that there should be in all cases as little interference as possible with the rights and privileges of the citizen, whether in his individual or associate capacity. And accordingly, in devising any plan for the supervis- ion of railroad corporations, the aim should be to leave them the largest freedom of action compatible with a proper security of the public interests. WHOLESOME RESTRAINTS BY GENERAL ENACTMENT. Acting upon this principle, and believing that the state does not possess, and never can possess the necessary foresight and knowl- edge of the ever shifting conditions upon which railway earnings depend, to enable it to prescribe details of management by statute, we believe it may and should determine the general conditions of both organization and management. In addition to legislation against discrimination, as already suggested, the legislature may most practically fix a maximum of aggregate earnings, and possibly of gross operating expenditure upon a definite investment. In this respect the state may accomplish all that it deems best to accom- plish, and all that the scope of its duties or the interests of the pub- lic require in this regard, by general enactments. It is suggested that laws thus framed, limiting without endanger- ing the rewards of capital, protecting without jeopardizing the pub- lic interest in railway enterprise, its administration subject to the immediate supervision and in some degree to the discretion of the railway commissioners, would be most likely to combine all the wholesome restraints claimed for an enlightened public opinion, with the more efficient restraints of positive law. It is practicable to limit railway charges by law in one of two ways: either by establishing a direct limitation of rates, or by fix- ing a limitation of profits. 1. Direct limitation of charges-Maximum rates fairly deter- mined. It is manifest that if maximum rates are to afford the public any real security, and yet not do the companies injustice, they can &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 133 1868 Mil. and St. P.

The court held that the reservation of the power, to alter, contained in the law of 1841 affected the entire relation between the state and corporation, and placed under legislative control all rights, privileges and immunities derived by the charter from the state, and Mr. Justice Field, in delivering the opinion of the court, uses this language: &quot;It is true that the charter of the company, when accepted by the corporat- ors, constituted a contract between them and the state, and that the amend- ment, when accepted, formed a part of the contract from that date, and was of the same obligatory character, and it may be equally true, as stated by counsel, that the exemption from taxation added greatly to the value of the stock of the company and induced the plaintiff to purchase the shares held by him, but these considerations cannot be allowed any weight in determining the vali- dity of the subsequent taxation. The power reserved in the state by the law of 1841, authorized any change in the contract as it originally existed, or as subsequently modified, or its entire revocation. The original corporators or subsequent stockholders took their interests with knowleege of the existence of this power and of the possibilty of its exercise at any time in the discretion of the legislature.&quot; The case of Miller v. State, 15 Wall., p. 478, was where a railroad company was organized under the general laws of the state of New York, whose con- stitution had a similar clause to our own, as to alteration and repeal. By the original charter of the company a capital of $800,000 was provided for, to build a road fifty miles in length. The city of Rochester was authorized by law to subscribe for $300,000 of the capital stock, and was to have the right, by the act of the legislature, to appoint four out of the thirteen directors of the company. All but 18 miles of the road was abandoned, and the legisla- ture afterwards passed an act, authorizing the city of Rochester to appoint seven directors, that being a majority of the whole number, and this last act was assailed as impairing the obligations of contracts. The courts of New York held the act constitutional, and the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the decision, citing and approving the language above quoted from 13 Wallace. These cases have been cited with some particularity of detail, because they construe and apply this reservation of power to a variety of cases, and seem to cover and meet, to a great degree, all the objections which have been urged against the validity of the law under consideration. Other similar cases might be added, and the elementary writers cited as being in accord with the doctrine of these decisions, but the opinion of Chancellor Kent will only be given as expressed in his Commentaries. Vol. 2, page 396, he says: &quot;and though the validity of the alteration or repeal of a charter in consequence of such a reservation may not be legally questionable, yet it may become a mat- ter of serious consideration in many cases, how far the exercise of such a power could be consistent with justice or policy. If a charter be granted and accepted with that reservation, there seems to be no ground to question the validity and efficiency of the reservation.&quot; To this should perhaps be added the case of Olcott v. Supervisors of Fond du Lac County, 16 Wall., p. 694, which, while not turning on the construction or effect of the reserved power of alteration or repeal, yet is referred to in this emphatic language: &quot;That the legislature of Wisconsin may alter or repeal the charter granted to the Sheboygan &amp;amp; Fond du Lac Railroad Company is certain. This is a power reserved by the constitution. The railroad can therefore be controlled and regulated by the state, its use can be defined, its tolls and rates for transportation may be limited&quot;-precisely what chapter 273 undertakes to do, and which the supreme court of the United States de- clares may be done, and done under and by virtue of the constitutional reser- vation. It is, I understand, conceded by all who have given opinions hostile to this legislation, that, by virtue of the constitutional reservation, all acts of incor- poration may be absolutely repealed, and the corporations created by them dissolved. If the legislature can thus wholly destroy every corporation it has created, and compel a total surrender of all franchises and privileges, and of all power to transact business, except such as may be necessary to convert its property into money and wind up its affairs, it seems difficult to &apos; &quot;106 Report of Railroad Commissioners. date consisted of $14,693,500 in bonds bearing currency interest, and $14,845,000 in gold bonds, making a total of $29 538,500. The bonded debt of the proprietary roads at the same date consisted of $6,750,000 in bonds bear- ing currency interest, and $7,875,000 in gold bonds, making a total of $14,625,000, and an aggregate of bonded debt for all the lines owned and op- erated, of $43,658,500. The total expenditures for the year, on all lines, for construction and equipment, amounted to the sum of $4,935,668.81, of which sum $1,065,278.92 was on account of the proprietary roads. The earnings from passengers during the year were apportioned as follows: First class, $2,786,237.35; second class, $311,513.70; excursion, $61,124.25; commutation, $267,949.05. The average earnings per passenger per mile were 3.16 cents, as against 3.14 cents the previous year. The average earnings on freight per ton per mile were 2.35 cents, as against 2.22 cents the preceding year. CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN BONDED DEBT. June 1, 1871, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway issued its bonds, called the Menomonee Extension First Mortgage Sinking Fund Gold Bonds, for the purpose of constructing and equipping that portion of the road from Fort Howard to a point at or near the mouth of the Menomonee River, and so much of the connection therewith in the state of Michigan as lies between the north line of the state of Wisconsin and the line of railroad of the Chi- cago and Northwestern Railway Company in Michigan, known as the Penin- sula division. The amount of these bonds was $2,700,000; the interest was 7 per cent. in gold, payable semi-annually; and the principal was made pay- able in gold, on the first day of June, 1911, and payment was secured by a trust deed on the portion of the road named, about 120 miles. The bonded debt thus created was at the rate of $22,500 per mile on this portion of the road, gold. April 1, 1871, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Co. issued its bonds, called the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company&apos;s &amp;quot;Madison Exten- sion First Mortgage Sinking Fund Gold Bonds,&amp;quot; for the purpose of con- structing that portion of the road extending from Madison to the junction with the La Crosse, Trempealeau and Prescott road, a distance of about 126 miles. The sum of these bonds was $3,150,000, or $25,000 per mile, with in- terest at 7 per cent., payable semi-annually, the principal due in 1911, and both principal and interest being payable in gold, with security by trust deed, on the entire railroad and fixtures. March 10, 1862, the Winona and St. Peter Railroad Company was incor- porated, and subsequently issued its bonds for which bonds were guaranteed in 1870 by the Chicago and Northwestern Company. The La Crosse, Trempealeau and Prescott Railroad Co. was organized un- der act of March 6, 1857, and afterwards issued bonds, which the Chicago and Northwestern Co. subsequently guaranteed by virtue of act of March 10, 1871.

For these reasons it is believed there is but little danger that the $6,000,000,000 of capital said to be invested in railways will be sacrificed, or that the people of any country will knowingly cripple. this immensely important interest. THE PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED. From all the foregoing considerations, it is manifest that the railway problem, simply stated, is this, namely: how to devise a sys- tem of control in the interest of the public that will, at the same time, be entirely just to the railway corporations? ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE THE RAILWAY PROBLEM IN EUROPE. 1. Attempts in England. As the railway had origin in England, so was it there that the conflict between the railway companies and the public first devel- oped itself. The earliest acts of incorporation established maximum rates for each company chartered. Nevertheless, for a long time, as was natural, the reliance of the public and of Parliament, for se- curity against mismanagement and unfair rates, was mainly upon competition, in one form or another. So little was at first under- stood of the capacity of the railway for the carrying business that it was even supposed common wagon-roads would hold it in check. Then canals were to compete for the heavier traffic. The conces- sions made to the first companies were accordingly very indefinite. Treating the railroad as an improved highway for the accommo- dation of a general freight and passenger traffic, it was expected to be open to all persons who might choose to run trains upon it, sub- ject to the tolls prescribed by the owning company, within limita- tions to be fixed by Parliament. This plan did not work to satis- faction, however, and as early as 1839-&apos;40 a committee of parlia- &quot; &apos;20 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

This particular cause of undue cost will be best appreciated by skillful engineers, who cannot have failed to note how very often lines of railway are made to cost much more than was necessary by careless surveys. But one need not be more than an ordinary en- gineer, or even a professional engineer at all, to detect expensive blunders of this sort on every hand-blunders which not only occa- sion a large increase in the cost of construction, but also a perma- nent extra expense of working. 4. Corrupt letting of contracts. Probably the system of construction by &quot;rings&quot; formed inside to operate outside, for the private gain of individual officers and their friends, is, of all causes of excessive cost, the most prolific. Of course there are many railway officers too honorable to resort to measures for private advantage which involve the robbery of stock- holders and creditors; but such practices are nevertheless so com- mon as to make it somewhat doubtful whether they do not consti- tute the rule rather than the exception. Sometimes they are car- ried on by directors and officers openly, but oftener, of course, under cover. We would not be understood as branding every con- struction company composed in whole, or in part, of officers and members of the company contracted with, as guilty of fraudulent dealing with stockholders. A construction company possesses some advantages for conducting the work of construction which a chartered railroad company does not possess--especially if many of the directors of the railway company are non-resident and the undersigned have knowledge of some such who are be- lieved to conduct the business of building in that way solely be- cause of these advantages, and wholly in the interest of the stock- holders who compose the railway company. They are forced to be- lieve, however, that the number of those who thus manage is com- paratively small. -- It is impossible to estimate with any degree of accuracy the amount of the burden upon the industry of this country by fraudu- lent building contracts, but it is safely assumed to be enormous. 5.

CHICAGO &amp;amp; NORTHWESTERN RAILWAY, Office of the the General Manager, CHICAGO, Dec. 15, 1874. GENTLEMEN: In answer to your circular of Sept. 28th, and letter of Dec. 1st, I beg to hand you herewith the following statements, which I have had prepared: No. 1. Statistics of Chicago and Northwestern Railway in Wisconsin. No. 2. Statistics of Northwestern Union Railroad. No. 3. Statistics of La Crosse, Trempealeau and Prescott Railroad. No. 4. Statement of cost of La Crosse, Trempealeau and Prescott Railroad, to June 30, 1874. No. 5. Statement of cost of Northwestern Union Railroad to June 30, 1874. No. 6. Statement of cost of Madison Extension, to June 30, 1874. (Now con- solidated and part of Chicago and Northwestern Railway.) No. 7. Statement of cost of Menominee Extension, to June 30, 1874. (Now consolidated with and part of Chicago and Northwestern Railway.) No. 8. Statement of cost of balance of Chicago and Northwestern Railway, situated in state of Wisconsin, made up from the data which this office contains, and in itself explaining fully the mode of making up. It is impossible for me to give you any more data than those contained in the statements enclosed, from the fact that the old books and papers of the railroads now consolidated with this company were destroyed in the Chicago fire of 1871. You will observe that the &quot;old&quot; Chicago and Northwestern Railway shows to have cost more per mile than the road that has since been constructed, the details of which we are enabled to send you, but in connec- tion with this, two important points must be understood and appreciated: 1st. That it is an old road, with more permanent structures, better ad- justed grades, wider embankments, enlarged depot grounds, additional and lengthened side tracks, and the earth taken out of cuts, to a very much great- er extent than in the case of the new roads, these works being the result of gradual improvement, and costing large sums of money. 2d. That these extensions to the road, of the last few years, show only the cost of building these roads in the state of Wisconsin, and they, as well as the old road in that state, should pay their pro rata proportion of the cost of all the expensive plant, depot grounds, machine shops, freight houses, etc., in Chicago, their common terminus, which have cost many millions of dollars. If it were possible to separate this cost from the consolidated expense, which, owing to the destruction of the books previously referred to, cannot be done, I would have tried to do it, but as it is not, I have not undertaken it, &apos; &apos;Decrees confirming Reports of Sales. 85 Mississppi river in the state of Wisconsin, and formerly known as the south- ern Wisconsin line or railroad, including the right of way and land occupied by said road between the said points, together with the superstructure and tracks thereon, and all rails and other materials used thereon, bridges, via- ducts, culverts, fences, equipments and necessary depot grounds and build- ings thereon, belonging to said Milwaukee &amp;amp; Mississippi Railroad Company, and all rolling stock, engines, tenders, cars, tools, materials, machinery, fix- tures and all other personal property appertaining to said line of roads, and now belonging to the said Milwaukee &amp;amp; Mississippi Railroad Company from Janesville to the Mississippi river, and all right thereto, and interest therein, together with the name and functions appertaing to said road from Janesville to the Mississippi river, tolis, rents and income to be had or levied therefrom, and all corporate and other rights, franchises and privileges of said company of, in, to or concerning the same.&quot; Report of sale filed January 21, 1871.

And if not, why not? First, because the wisdom and foresight that should eminently characterize the management of railways are often wanting to the managers. Secondly, because the managers are not unfrequently in their places for the sole purpose of promoting their own personal ends. But, again, there are cases in which the interests of railway cor- porations and the public are opposed. For example, it is the inter- est of the companies to prevent the building of competing roads; to hamper and embarrass rival lines already established; to force such traffic as they are able to command over as much of their own lines respectively as possible, though it be at the expense of time and other advantage on the part of the shipper. For all these reasons, and others that might be named, the in- sufficiency of self-interest on the part of companies, as a protection to the public, has been long recognized. COMPETITION AN UNCERTAIN RELIANCE. Competition is so invariably applicable as a restraint in all sorts of trades, professions, and ordinary commercial enterprises, that it is not surprising how long it has misled the public and legislative bodies. It always serves as a protection where it is full and per- manently maintained, as well in matters of transportation as in the case of the trades and most individual enterprises. Bui therein lies the difficulty: Competition implies freedom of the operator, both as to material and forces. In case of the ordinary avocations, this freedom is practically quite complete; the materials and the labor to be used can be had in the open market, and fair purchase is protected by the active interest of those who have them to sell. To some extent, this is also true in matters of transportation. For example, there is entire freedom for all upon the high seas, and upon great inland waters, where the laws of nations or the treaties of nations, and the universal sentiment of civilized peoples defend the rights of all alike. These are nature&apos;s highways which neither capitalist nor potentate can shut up for his own exclusive use. Wherever they exist they insure a fair rate of transportation upon 4-R.

D. 1872, by and between the Northwestern Union Railway Company, of Wisconsin, a &quot; &quot;26 Appendix. And the plaintiff further shows, upon information and belief, that on the 11th day of May, 1874, the said defendant charged and received of S. Cad- wallader, of the city of Madison, the sum of ninety cents for a ticket upon its railroad, from the city of Madison to Mazomanie, a station on its road, distant twenty-three miles from Madison, and did demand and receive of and from the said Cadwallader the said sum of ninety cents for carrying him as a passenger on its said railroad said distance of twenty-three miles between the places last aforesaid, which said last mentioned sum was higher and greater than the sum and rate fixed therefor by said chapter 273. And the plaintiff further shows and alleges that the said defendant, the Chi- cago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company has, by the several acts, omissions and matters herein alleged and set forth, violated the provisions of the said act of the legislature, and has offended against the provisions of the same and of the several articles of association, and acts creating, confirming and altering said corporation, and has exercised franchises and privileges not conferred upon it by law, and has thereby forfeited its privileges, franchises and charter as a corporation. Wherefore the plaintiff prays and demands that the article of association and charter of the said defendant, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, be vacated, the existence of said corporation annulled, and that all the rights, franchises, powers and privi- leges conferred upon the said defendant, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company by the laws of this state, may be adjudged and de- clared to be forfeited, and that the said defendant be excluded from all corpo- rate rights and privileges, and that said corporation, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company be dissolved, and for the costs of this action.

A. SCOTT SLOAN. DECISION OF THE CIRCUIT COURT. Of the United States for the Western District of Wisconsin; in the case of— WILHELM FREDRICK PICK, HENRY R. PERSON, THE FARMER&apos;S LOAN &amp;amp; TRUST CO., AND THE UNION TRUST Co., vs. THE CHICAGO &amp;amp; NORTH- WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY, GEO. H. PAUL, JOSEPH H. OSBORN, JOHN W. HOYT AND A. SCOTT SLOAN. OPINION BY JUSTICE DRUMMOND. We have not had time to prepare any opinion in the case, but, as it was thought desirable that there should be an immediate decision upon the motion for an injunction, I am instructed by the court to present the following as its conclusions upon the points made upon the motion for a preliminary injunction : 1. On the assumption that the act of the 11th of March, 1874, &amp;quot;relating to railroads, express and telegraph companies in the state of Wisconsin&amp;quot; is invalid, we think the court has jurisdiction of the case. The bill is filed by the bondholders, citizens of Europe and of other states, to enforce equitable rights, and to prevent action by the Railroad Commissioners which may &quot; &apos;134 Report of Railroad Commissioners. quire a full exhibit of the business standing of the company, and order the same made public; they could limit the duties of their officers, and exercise a controlling supervision of their property, in their own interest and that of the public. But we are comparatively without this proper regulating element. In fact, with exceptional cases, the stockholder is regardless of his controlling power, and delegates it to the officers. It is, therefore, only through the power of the State that the func- tions which properly belong to the stockholder can be made to ap- ply in controlling the management of railroad corporations, and to this power therefore the people have applied to correct evils which they could not otherwise reach. And it is eminently proper that the state should in its power, in behalf of the public which it is bound to protect, assume those duties which are neglected by the stockholder, or of which the stockholder has been deprived, until the natural conservatism inherent in the nature of things has had time to produce a reaction in railroad management. Here, then, is an opportunity for the proper exercise of state con- trol which will look to the establishment of those governing condi- tions to which we have alluded, and which may ultimately charact- erize the relations between state and company. It may be said that legislation of the kind last spoken of would partake of the character of state ownership; but such a construc- tion cannot properly be applied, although, in the case of the land grant, there may be said to be an actual investment, a considera- tion by implication; yet the part taken by the state would be en- tirely supervisory, and in protection of the interest of the public. We have, then, abundant opportunity for the interposition of state control in a direction which would serve to establish what may very properly be called the normal condition of a railway company. There can be no sensible reason given why the control should not be extended in the direction pointed out, and that what has been termed the &quot;barbarous thumb rule&quot; should not be withdrawn as soon as the conditions are reached which would, through an enlight- ened public opinion created and sustained by complete business exhibits of the companies, establish mutual confidence between those and the people as to management. It is not to be expected that the kind of control indicated would be kindly appreciated by those who now have acquired the control of such large properties &apos; &quot;50 Report of Railway Commissioners. the water; first, because any one able to build a vessel can com- pete for a share of the carriage; secondly, because of the facility with which vessels can be moved from an over-crowded and non- paying locality or traffic to a better, and thus enable the trader to employ his capital all the year round. The same is true, to a less extent, of navigable rivers; while the current flows, they are open to the enterprise of one citizen as well as another. Where any one of these means of transportation exists, there is not only good security against extortionate charges on such high- way, but there is also greater security against such charges on rail- ways; inasmuch as, by a law of commerce, the price at which any necessity can be supplied to a great market by one line of transpor- tation sets a practical limit to the rate of transportation by another line. So far as this influence relates to rivers, it is limited by this cir- cumstance: that, in cold climates like our own, it is only operative for a part of the season. While in the case of canals, there are still other circumstances limiting it, namely, the fact that they are generally so limited in extent as to be only very local, as well as temporary, in their influence; and the other fact that, being artificial highways, they are property, and hence liable to fall into the very hands they were designed to restrain. We may consider it, therefore, a decision of reason as well as experience, that while competition upon ocean or inland sea is both potent and permanent as to its own field of operations, and is also potent as against railway transportation wherever it can be brought to bear; and while competition by river and canal are also to a con- siderable extent available, they are none of them sufficient to afford the requisite security. Still less reliable is competition between railway companies. Here the natural law is not certainly operative. There is neither freedom of means nor of forces. A road once built cannot be placed in any market the company pleases and compete for freight, as the manufacturer can compete for his raw material, or the mer- chant vessel for a cargo. It can only offer its facilities and bide its time. Should no rival spring up to contest the field, it can com- mand the produce of the section of country tributary to it, on its own terms, so that it leaves barely margin of profit enough to the producer and dealer to induce production and delivery. And if, &quot; &apos;Railroad Aid. 35 little below those of the Potter Law, would afford a sufficient answer to this inquiry. But up to this time we have no knowledge of any sufficient reason for the very remarkable differences in the charges of the several railways cited. RAILROAD AID. Assuming that a recognition of the aid given to railroad com- panies of the state properly belongs to a consideration of the gen- eral question of cost, the commissioners commenced investigations at an early day, with a view to determine, if possible,- (1) The amount of lands donated by Congress, and actually re- ceived by various companies to aid in the construction of railways; (2) The amount of bonds executed for the same purpose by counties, towns and municipalties; and (3) The amount of aid rendered in the form of farm-mortgages. To this end, inquiries were addressed to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, to railway companies, to clerks of all county and town boards of supervisors, and all registers of deeds in coun- ties traversed by railways, and supposed to have given aid to rail- road construction in any form. Owing to the difficulties inseparable from such an undertaking, including the shortness of time for the work, and the want of funds for such use, these efforts have not been wholly successful. The facts obtained will be found under the head of &quot;Statement of Land Grants in aid of Wisconsin Roads,&quot; (pages 227-241), and in tabulated form, on page 242. It is sufficient, in this connection, to say, in general terms (1) That so far as is already learned, the total amount of aid realized from congressional land grants, is 3,343,458 acres; esti- mated value, at $3 per acre, $10,030,074; (2) That we have found record of $6,910,652 in county, town and municipal bonds, paid or held for collection, and representing 36 counties and 71 towns and cities; (3) That we have found record of 3,785 farm mortgages, dis- tributed among 27 counties, and aggregating, in amount, $4,079,433; Thus making a grand total-the correctness of our valuation of the lands being granted-of $21,227,160. &apos; &quot;236 Report of Railroad Commissioners. &amp;quot;It is understood by this office that the legislature designated the La Crosse and Milwaukee Company to build the road and receive the grant. &amp;quot;The act of July 27, 1868, is meant to relieve the state of the obligation incurred by the act of congress and its own legislative enactments, and to au- thorize the legislature to dispose of the lands for the Farm Mortgage Com- pany. As the act of 1864, authorizes a road from Tomah to St. Croix river or lake, and makes a grant therefor, and as the company holding that grant have built the road trom Tomah westward, we certainly cannot recognize the right of another company to select lands within their limits. Hence any selections on account of the Farm Mortgage Company, as assignees of the La Crosse and Milwaukee Company, under the act of 1856, must be restricted to the grant of 1856, south of Tomah. &amp;quot;The only question then is how much of the lands heretofore certified may be sold for the benefit of the Farm Company. The opinion expressed by us was that only so much as fall south of Tomah could be disposed of for that purpose, because north of that point the grant of 1864 held, and the lands certified north of Tomah are required to be charged to that grant. &amp;quot;Under the grant of 1864, the Tomah and St. Croix Railroad Company, as the corporation authorized by the state to build the road, had complied with all the conditions of the grant and commenced the construction of their road from Tomah northward prior to the passage of the act of 1868. They had thus acquired vested rights which could not be interfered with, and which, certainly, by the terms of the act, attached to the lands previously certified and lying between the termini of their road. &amp;quot;Further, the principles governing the department in the adjustment of all railroad grants is, that the company can acquire no right to lands beyond the termini of the road, and as that portion of the La Crosse and Mil- waukee road, under the act of 1856, now in the hands of the Farm Mortgage Company, does not extend northward beyond Tomah, we hold to the opinion of our former letter, that said company have no right to the certified lands beyond that point. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, &amp;quot;COPY.&amp;quot; JOS. S. WILSON, Commissioner.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, &amp;quot;General Land Office, March 24, 1869. &amp;quot;His Excellency, LUCIUS FAIRCHILD, Governor, Madison, Wisconsin: &amp;quot;SIR-I have had the honor to receive your communication of 8th inst., asking for a copy of our instructions relative to the selection and location of lands granted to states and railroads—and requesting that we will inform you as to what lands shall be disposed of under the several railroad acts. &amp;quot;As per request, I herewith enclose the copy of instructions, and upon a careful examination of the statutes, reply to your inquiries as follows: &amp;quot;1st. The act of 3d June, 1856, makes a grant of land to Wisconsin for the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad from Madison or Columbus to St. Croix Lake. &amp;quot;2d. The act of May 5, 1864, makes a grant for a road from Tomah to St. Croix Lake and directs that the lands granted under the former act shall be charged to the present grant. &amp;quot;3d. The act of July 27, 1868, authorizes so much of the lands certified to the state under the act of June 3, 1856, as are due the state for the portion of the St. Croix and Milwaukee Road completed, to be sold for the benefit of the Wisconsin Railroad Farm Mortgage Land Company.&apos; &amp;quot; &amp;quot;4th. The governor of the state has certified to the completion of the road from Portage City to Tomah, a distance of sixty-one miles: and &amp;quot;5th.

C. McCoun, in Verplanck v. Mercantile Ins. Co., to think that the decision was against the jurisdiction under any circum- stances. And, with all our admiration of his learning and deference for his authority, and veneration for his judicial qualities, we cannot help feeling that, as in the case of the exercise of the right of eminent domain, the great Chancellor misled the courts of New York into error on this question also. In the one case, it took them some quarter of a century to return to sound principles. In the other, they have not yet done so. So mischevious is the sanction of a great name to error. It is hardly necessary to add that we sustain the jurisdiction to enjoin a corporation from abuse or excess of franchise, or other violation of public law, to public detriment, on information in equity, filed ex-officio by the Attor- ney General. It will be perceived that we do not found our jurisdiction on ch. 148, secs. 13 and 14, R. S. We quite agree with the counsel for the defendants, that these sections confer no jurisdiction on this court. Whether they operate to limit the jurisdiction of the Circuit courts, or are only declaratory of the jur- isdiction which we hold to exist outside of them, we need not consider here. It is certain that they do not limit the jurisdiction of this court, if it be com- petent for the legislature to limit it. The jurisdiction which we claim for this court puts the writ of injunction to a prerogative use. And we are strongly inclined to think that our views of our jurisdiction of these informations, follow almost logically from our views of our jurisdiction of the writ as a quasi prerogative writ. And we have illy expressed ourselves and illy applied the authorities quoted, if we have not already made it appearent that we consider this jurisdiction, in this court, a necessary and most salutary one for the preservation of public right and public authority. It was objected to the exercise of the jurisdiction in these cases, that it would deprive the defendants of the right of trial by jury, secured by sec. 5, art. I, of the state constitution, extending to all cases at law. It has been held by this court that this constitutional guarantee does not extend to cases in equity, including such cases of legal right as, by the prac- tice of courts of equity, had become of equitable cogizance, at the time of the adoption of the constitution. Stillwell v. Kellogg, 14 Wis., 461, affirmed in several late cases cited in Vilas &amp;amp; Bryant&apos;s notes. The constitution was adopted in 1848. And the English cases prior to that time are authority to show this equitable jurisdiction. For it was four- teen years later that the court of chancery was authorized by act of parlia- ment to determine all questions of law and fact, with one qualified excep- tion. 25 and 26 Vic., ch. 42, sec. 1. And the English and American cases cited show that this jurisdiction was an established equitable jurisdiction, at the time the constitution was adopted. But were this otherwise, we cannot perceive of what trial by jury, of what legal right, these informations can deprive the defendants. Their whole defence rests in questions of law. There is no fact for them to reverse, except their violation of the law. And their denial of this, if indeed they are to be taken as denying it, is manifestly formal only. And, if it were a bona fide denial, these proceedings would not deprive them of any legal right triable by jury. If the law be valid, they are bound to obey it. If they are obeying it, the jurisdiction cannot harm them or deprive them of any trial. If they are not obeying it, there is nothing involved here to be tried. The objec- tion is specious, but is only specious. The question is not here, and we shall not consider it, whether, under our practice, we could take equitable jurisdiction of a case in which a legal right is involved triable by jury, and provide for a trial of that right by a jury, so as to satisfy the provisions of the constitution. It was also urgently pressed upon us that, all other questions apart, no equitable proceeding would lie to enforce chap. 273 of 1874, because it fur- nishes its own remedies by providing penalties against the corporations vio- lating it. We do not consider the rule on which the defendants rely, appli- cable to cases of this character, and should probably hold so in these cases, if the fact were as stated. But we shall not discuss the question, because it is not here. These informations go to enforce the rates fixed by the statute it- &quot; &quot;314 Report of Railroad Commissioners. Chap. 232 G.

Extravagance led to financial em- barrassment; concealment was necessary to the maintenance of credit; capi- tal accounts were unduly increased; revenue expenses were not sufficiently incurred or not properly charged; accounts were falsified; the balance sheet made to suit the dividend, in place of profits (or losses) being calculated from its figures.&quot; This kind of experience has led them in England to look more closely after the management of their railroad corporations, and thus regulate the governing conditions which determine proper lim- itations in charges as between capital and the public, and at the the same time correct abuses of reposed trusts in the management. Great advances have been made in this direction in England, and the strict accountability of managers, both to stockholders and the public, is becoming incorporated in their railroad system. The following article from the Railroad Gazette of Nov. 28th, is to the point: * * &quot;Now we do not here wish to discuss particularly the question at issue in this case, * but only the closeness of the relations of the shareholders of English companies to their directors, which in this case forced the latter to submit a question concerning the conduct of the traffic of the road, on which they had not only made but announced their determina- tion, to the approval of the shareholders, and to call a meeting for that pur- pose. It would astonish American shareholders to be consulted on such a matter almost as much as it seems to have astonished the English public to have their favorite second class cars abolished. American shareholders hardly expect to be consulted about anything, unless it may be a proposition to consolidate or lease. Indeed, the English corporations are incomparably the more democratic of the two, in effect, if not in form. Perhaps the most striking illustration of this is the English half yearly meeting, at which the report of the working of the road and the action of the directors for the half year next proceeding are presented and offered for adoption or rejection, and at one of which directors and auditors are chosen. Now we have yearly meetings of shareholders here, but for the most part they are meetings in name rather than fact. Usually one or two directors are there with proxies for all the shares which offers to vote in their pockets, and often some clerk who happens to be near has to be called on to serve as secretary. In many, perhaps most cases, the annual report is not presented until after the meeting anp election; and only two or three companies, so far as we can remember, have an address from the President or any discussion from shareholders. Generally the only business done is the election of a board of directors, and the report, if one is published, passes without comment or criticism. The directors sometimes ask the shraeholders to authorize new loans, issues of shares, leases, consolidations, etc.; but in such cases no considerable atten- dance is expected at the meeting, and the spectacle of a hundred or two share- &apos; &quot;142 Report of Railway Commissioners.

Otherwise it was their duty to suspend their operations. In any case, the question cannot weigh in the consideration of our duty to enjoin the actual disobedience of the law. VII. The defendant, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp;amp; St. Paul Company, pleads the charter of the territorial legislature of February 11, 1847, incorporating the Milwaukee &amp;amp; Waukesha Railroad Company, and the organization of the corporation thereunder; the act of the territorial legislature of March 11, 1848, extending the road from Waukesha to Prairie du Chien, and the con- struction of the road from Milwaukee to Prairie du Chien in the years 1850– 1856; the act of the state legislature of February 1, 1850, giving the corpora- tion the new name of the Milwaukee &amp;amp; Mississippi Railroad Company; the act of the state legislature of March 31, 1860, to facilitate the formation of a corporation with franchises of the original company, upon foreclosure of their mortgage, and the formation thereunder by the purchasers, of the Mil- waukee &amp;amp; Prairie du Chien Railway Company; and the conveyance of the road and franchises by that company to the defendant by deed of August 1, 1868; and we find an act of February 15, 1868, ratifying the purchase by the defendant of the road and franchises. We presume that the purchase had been then made, though the deed followed after. We have not considered the title of the defendant to this road, because we think it immaterial here. The road is actually operated by the defendant, and is, therefore, included in the same class with the other roads of the de- fendant by chapter 273. And the question before us must rest on the charter of the road, not on the title of the defendant. In saying this, we imply no doubt of the title; we only say that we have not investigated it, because it does not enter into any question before us. The charter of 1847-1848 appoints commissioners to take subscriptions of stock; and, upon subscription and payment of stock as therein directed, creates the subscribers a corporation vested with the franchises of the act. This act does not create a corporation vested with the franchises of the act. This act does not create a corporattion by its own force only; the prescribed subscription is a condition precedent to the existence of the corporation The corporation came into existence, probably, upon the election of directors by the subscribers. Putnam v. Sweet, 1 Chandler, 286. It is not pleaded, and does not appear, when the corporation was actually organized. For all that appears here, it may have been at any time between 1847 and 1850. We are inclined to think, however, that under such a charter, when the existence of the corporation appears, as here, there is a presump- tion that it was organized immediately after the passage of the charter. In this case, there is certainly a presumption that the corporation was in esse before the passage of the supplementary corporation by name. This is not, of course, conclusive of the fact, but it is all that we have in this case now: and we must presume, for the purpose of this motion, that the charter was accep- ted and the corporation organized under it, before the adoption of the State Constitution in 1848. The original charter contains a franchise, upon completion of the road or any ten miles of it, to take such toll as the company should think reasonable. The road was not constructed till after the adoption of the Constitution, but it was constructed under the territorial charter. And the title to the fran- chise which runs with the road, dates from the organization of the corpora- tion. There may be facts which are not before us, or there may be legislation which we have not been able to find, which might operate to make the de- fendant hold the road built in pursuance of the territorial charter under fran- chises granted to the defendant, or to the defendant&apos;s grantor, by the state, and so bring the franchises of this road under the reserved power in the con- stitution. On the argument, we called on the Attorney General for informa- tion on this point: we were only informed that the territorial charter con- tained a reserved power to alter or repeal. On examination, we find this to be a mistake. The only power reserved is in section 20 of the act. And that only provides that, in case of violation of the charter by the company, the territorial or state legislature might resume the rights and privileges granted by it. &quot; &quot;Records of Railway Companies. 119 tions of the said party of the second part, which said twelve hundred and sixty bonds shall bear date respectively on the first day of November, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, and be for one thousand dollars each, payable in forty years from said date, and bear interest at the rate of seven per centum per annum, payable semi-annually in the city of New York; and that the said twelve hundred and sixty bonds, to be issued as aforesaid, shall be part of a series of eighteen hundred bonds of one thousand dollars each, all of which shall bear interest and be payable as aforesaid, and all of which shall be equally secured by a deed of trust or mortgage, to be executed by the said Winona &amp;amp; St. Peter Railroad Company to Samuel J.

MILWAUKEE AND FOND DU LAC RAILROAD. Incorporated by chapter 94, Laws of 1851, with twenty-five commissioners, who were authorized to organize by choosing a board of thirteen directors. Capital stock limited to $800,000. The route prescribed was from the city of Milwaukee, via Iron Ridge, in the county of Dodge, to the town of Fond du Lac, in Fond du Lac county. The company was authorized to borrow money, contract debts, sue and be sued, and perform all the usual business of an in- corporated body. At any time within five years after the passage of the act, the company was authorized to extend its road on the west side of Lake Win- nebago and Fox river, from the city of Fond du Lac to Green Bay, in Brown county, in which event it was authorized to increase its capital stock to $2,000,- 000. Act approved Feb. 21, 1851. Chap. 244, Laws of 1853, authorized the city of Milwaukee to loan its cre- dit to the Milwaukee and Fond du Lac railroad company, among others, in a sum not exceding $200,000, the bonds to be issued being payable in not less than ten nor more that twenty years. In consideration of such issue, the com- pany was required to execute to the treasurer of the city a bond of indem- nity in double the amount of the par value of the loan, to punctually pay all in- terest and principal as it became due, and all damages that might be sustained growing out of the same. It was made the duty of the common council of the city to see to it that security was ample before the issue of any bonds. This done, the faith of the city was pledged for the payment; but before any issue, an ordinance providing for such delivery was required to be submitted to the voters of the city at a special election held for that purpose, and a ma- jority of the votes cast on the subject was made necessary to its legal validity. Act approved April 2, 1853. Chap. 321, Laws of 1853, authorized the Milwaukee and Fond du Lac Rail- road Company to consolidate its capital stock with the capital stock of the Milwaukee, Fond du Lac and Green Bay Railroad Company, upon terms to be mutually agreed upon, and to increase the capital stock to the aggregate of the capital stock of the two companies; the name of the new company to be the Milwaukee, Fond du Lac and Green Bay Railroad Company. The directors of the new company were not to be less than seven, nor more than thirteen. Sec. 4 authorized the city of Milwaukee to issue the bonds provid- ed for in chap. 244, laws of 1853, to the consolidated company. Act approved June 27, 1853. Chap. 380, Laws of 1853, authorized the city of Milwaukee to loan its credit to the Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad Company, and any other railroad company duly incorporated and organized for the purpose of constructing railroads leading from the city of Milwaukee into the interior of the state, which, in the opinion of the common council, are entitled to aid from said city; provided, that the amount so issued should not exceed $200,000 to any one road, and the total aggregate to all roads should not exceed $1,000,000.

And railway_companies will not be allowed to exercise their discretion capriciously. 1 Railway Cases, 288; but the court will supervise their discretion, as in seeing that they shall not take more land than is needed, nor take any land merely in order to get earth for embankments. 1 id., 576; 4 Mylne &amp;amp; Č., 116; and that they do not un- necessarily affect a mill-race by too small an arch over it. 1 Russell and M., 181; 2 Railway Cases, 280. 66 Railway companies must stand upon a strict construction of their char- tered privileges. 21 State R., 22; 9 Beavan, 391; 2 Mann and Granger, 134; 7 id., 253; 1 Railway Cases, 576; 3 id., 563; 21 Eng. L. &amp;amp; E., 620. With the immense powers that are freely and loosely given to them, this much restraint is essential to the protection of private rights. 1 Railway Cases, 154, 504, 636; 4 Mylne &amp;amp; C., 120. &amp;quot;If they step one inch beyond their chartered privileges to the prejudice of others or of the stockholders, or offer to do any act without the prescribed preliminary steps, they are liable to be enjoined, irrespective of the amount of damage.&amp;quot; Commonwealth v. Railroad Co., 24 Penn. St., 159. There is no doubt or hesitation here. Time and experience had done their work; as the court says, referring to the English cases: &amp;quot;Such, at least, is the practice elsewhere, and it may be well for us to learn from the experience of others.&amp;quot; And the same doctrine is reaffirmed by the court, in 1867, in Spurhawk v. U. P. Railway Co., 54 Penn. St., 401. The question came again before the New Jersey chancery and court of errors in 1853, upon information and bill to restrain a corporation from exercising their franchises by the erection of a public nuisance. The Chan- cellor refused a preliminary injunction, but briefly and clearly asserted the jurisdiction. He says: &amp;quot;I have no doubt of the power of the court to interpose in this case by injunction; nor of the propriety of its exercising that peculiar jurisdiction, if, as alleged, the defendants, under and by virtue of the power of the legisla- ture, conferred upon the Patterson and Hudson River Railroad Company, to bridge the river Passaic, are obstructing the navigation of that river, in vio- lation of the provisions of the act from which they derive their authority.&amp;quot; The Court of Errors reversed the order of the Chancellor and granted the injunction, stating the doctrine in the language of Story&apos;s Equity. &amp;quot;In re- gard to public nuisances,&amp;quot; says Justice Story, &amp;quot;the jurisdiction of Courts of Equity seems to be of very ancient date, and has been distinctly traced back to the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The jurisdiction is applicable not only to public nuisances strictly so called, but also to pourprestures upon public rights and property, as public rivers,&amp;quot; etc. Att&apos;y Gen. v. Hudson River R. R. Co., 1 Stockton, 526. And again in 1855, upon an information and bill to restrain abuse of corpo- rate franchise, Chancellor Halsted had allowed a preliminary injunction, in an opinion in which, after his few authoritative words in the case last cited, he tacitly assumes the jurisdiction. A motion for attachment for violation of the injunction was heard before Green, C. J., sitting for Chancellor Wil- liamson, who had succeeded Chancellor Halsted, and had been of counsel in the cause. Chief Justice Green reviews the merits of the case at great length, without a word said of jurisdiction, and sustains the information on the mer- its. He gives a second opinion on the merits, upon exceptions taken, with the same significant silence. Elmore, J., delivers the judgment of the Court of Errors on appeal, at some length, affirming the orders of chancery, with the same tacit recognition of the jurisdiction, as one not to be doubted. An eloquent silence, following twenty-one years after the faltering opinion in Att&apos;y Gen. v. N. J. R. R. Co., supra. We can see nothing in conflict with these cases in the intermediate case of Att&apos;y Gen. v. Paterson, 1 Stockton, 624, cited for the defendants, which is in- deed a confirmation of the jurisdiction. In 1865, in Pennsylvania, one corporation filed a bill against another to en- force the charter obligations of the defendant. The court holds that, suffer- ing no special injury, the plaintiff could not maintain the bill, and thus, after much similar discussion, assigns the reason of the judgment: &quot; &apos;80 Appendix. stockholders in our railroads to improve the value of their property by fur. ther advances of money, are now obviously cut off, for looking at the &quot;Pot- ter Law,&quot; and the arguments by which it is sustained, what security is there that a future legislature may not appropriate to the public use without equi. valent, all the benefits new outlays may have created. We do not seek the advancement of the interests of our company at the expense of other interests of the state, and I have no doubt it will soon be found that any law which discourages the investment of private capital in incorporate undertakings cannot but eventually be highly prejudicial to the prosperity and development of the state at large. If it be the case when a number of individuals join their capital and com- bine in a corporation for some great public work they have no constitutional rights which the legislature is bound to respect, but that the very existence of their capital is subject to the caprice of a majority of those annually elected to the legislature, it behooves, to say the least of it, those holding this unlimited power to exercise it with the greatest prudence and care, and it requires no great_sagacity to see that such ill-advised, hasty and reckless measures as the “Potter Law,&quot; must forever stop the investment of capital both by our own people and strangers in those great public enterprises so es- sential to the development of our state. In view of the fact that the income to which this company is fairly and honestly entitled will, so long as the present law remains in force, be serious- ly impaired, the question presents itself, what course it ought to pursue. Two courses are open: Either to cut down its train service in respect to both quan- tity and kind to an extent made necessary by its diminished income, thereby withdrawing from the public the full facilities and accommodations to which they have been accustomed in transacting their business, or continue some. thing near the present service and submit to the loss thereby entailed. It would be with extreme reluctance that the Directors would adopt the former course, and rather than do so they have decided to make, for the pres- ent, large sacrifices. They the more readily come to this conclusion because the legislature of the state will meet in few months, and, believing as they do, that the &quot;Potter Law&quot; does not embody the real sentiments of the people of the state, in regard to railroads, they feel confident that wiser and better counsels will then prevail, than those which dictated that law-and that legislation alike just to the people and the roilroads will be enacted. I deeply regret that your excellency saw fit to regard the communication of April last as in any manner a defiance of the authority of the state, or that our positon should have been represented as one of rebellion against law. It was not so intended, but simply to notify you and through you the people of the state, of the course we felt compelled to pursue as the representatives of the property and interests committed to our charge, in order to obtain a ju- dicial determination of the questions involved at the earliest possible moment. The decision of the court now demonstrates that had we submitted to the law as passed, we should have needlessly sacrificed the rights and property of our stockholders as to the inter-state business of our road. While I have no doubt that your action in attempting to enforce this law was prompted by a desire to discharge your duty to the state, I trust you will find sufficient ground in what has occurred to accord to me equal honesty of purpose in discharging the duties of my position. Very respectfully, [Signed] ALEX. MITCHELL, President. &apos; &quot;40 Report of Railroad Commissioners. in the eastern and such other states as have a rougher surface, but less cheaply than those of Illinois and some of the other western states. With but few] exceptions the gradients are easy and the curvatures all that could be desired. If in many cases the culverts and bridges are less enduring than is desirable, and trestle-work has been too often substituted for embankments, it is doubtless because they were built only for tem- porary use and are to be replaced by stones, iron and earth as soon as the financial condition of the companies will warrant. The same may be said of the rail used. In some cases the necessi- ties of companies have led them to lay down iron of a very poor quality, and lighter than was really economical. And the result has been numerous accidents, and sometimes serious losses that might have been avoided had the importance of good iron and suf- ficient weight been duly appreciated. Sometimes it may be eco- nomical to lay rail below the ordinary weight, -as has been done on some of the recently constructed roads in this state,-especially where the abundance of timber admits of using an extra number of ties; but it is difficult to suggest circumstances that warrant the use of a quality of iron against the breaking of which no certain provision can possibly be made. The commissioners have been reminded of this principle in their travels over some sections of road forced through under a financial pinch. Where the traffic is light, as it must be for a time, along the line of the new roads, 50-pound iron will possibly answer the purpose, if of good quality and well tied. But where the business is heavy at any season of the year, 60-pound iron is light enough for either safety or economy. Care in laying rail appears not to have been more justly appreciated here than elsewhere as an essential of good construction and economical working. It is not uncom- mon to see the end of a rail battered down while the body of it is still almost as good as new. This is owing sometimes to a lack of uniform firmness in the material of the road bed. But it is oftener the result of neglect-first, to make a smooth-surfaced bed; sec- ondly, a total or partial neglect to ballast; and thirdly, neglect to make the connection carefully and keep the ends firmly in juxta- position with fish-bar fastening. It seems not to be fully realized that in addition to the depreciation of rail, and the increased liability to accidents consequent upon such neglect, there is a constant and very considerable damage to engines and rolling stock generally &quot; &apos;306 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

WISCONSIN CENTRAL R. R. CO. The Wisconsin Central Railroad Company was incorporated by chap. 62 laws of 1853, with all the usual powers, rights, privileges and franchises pertaining to such corporations. The capital stock was limited to $1,000,000. If road not commenced within three years and completed in ten, the charter was declared null and void. The route of the road as incorporated, was from Portage City by way of the village of Columbus in Columbia county, and the village of Whitewater in Walworth county, to the village of Genoa in said county, on such line as the directors should determine; and they were authorized to connect with any other road with which theirs might come in contact. Act approved March 4, 1853. Chap. 137, laws of 1858, changes the time of holding the annual election of directors of said company from the fourth Monday to the second Tues- day of December in each year. Act approved March, 31, 1858. Chapter 84, laws of 1863, extends the time for the expiration of the charter of the Wisconsin Central Railroad, for and during the term of five years from and after the third day of March, 1863: provided, that said road should be completed from the state line to the village of Jefferson by January 1st, 1865; and provided further, that towns issuing bonds in aid of such road should not be deprived of any defense they might interpose in consequence of such ex- tension. Act approved March 20, 1863. See also, chapter 429, laws of 1865. Chapter 205, laws of 1864, extends the time for the completion of said road from five years on and after the third day of March, 1863, to six years after said date; and that the road shall be completed from the state line to Jeffer- son by the 1st day of January, 1866. Act approved March 25, 1864. Chapter 451, laws of 1866, amends the charter of said company by requir- ing it to locate and maintain its road through the town of Waterloo and village of Tyrrahena, in Jefferson county. Act Approved April 11, 1866. Chapter 160, laws of 1869, repeals chapter 62 of the private and local laws of 1853, incorporating the Wisconsin Central Railroad Company and all acts amendatory thereto, and incorporates the Wisconsin Northern Railroad company. &apos; &quot;Railway Statistics. 81 continued through 1855 at Madison. Total paid stock, December 31, 1855, $1,826,438.81; total funded debt, $2,400,000. Total expenditures, to same date, for all purposes whatever, including Janesville branch, $3,578,757.80, of which $635,242.80 had been expended west of Madison, and $20,379.12 for right of way from Janesville to Monroe, and depot grounds at those places. The estimated cost of completing the main line from Madison to Prairie du Chien, and the branch line from Janesville to Monroe, a total distance of about 134 miles, according to contracts let, was $2,179,258, or $16,263 per mile. The cost of additional equipment contracted for, and deemed neces- sary to complete line, $241,985, making the entire estimated and constructed cost of the road complete to Prairie du Chien and Monroe, (238 miles of line and 30 miles of side-track,) with full equipment, including expenditures for all purposes from the beginning, $6,000,000-deducting cost of side-track— less than $25,000 per mile. The gross earnings for 1855 were $691,843.94; operating expenses, $273,797.06, or 40 per cent. of gross earnings. During the year the directors paid all the interest on funded debt, and declared a dividend on stock of 17 per cent.-10 per cent. in cash and 7 per cent in cash. To aid the construction of the road from Janesville to Monroe, the city of Milwaukee issued bonds for $300,000, and subscriptions were obtained in the counties of Rock, Green and Stephenson, for $362,700, one-half of the latter payable in cash and the remainder in mortgages upon land. December 12, 1855, the company contracted for all the work and materials on this part of the road, except rails, spikes and chairs, at $10,324 per mile-$300,000 to be paid in Milwaukee city bonds at par, the remainder in cash. December 31, 1856, the total stock paid footed up at $2,975,019.38, and the funded debt at $3,350,000. Total expenditures to that date, with estimated cost per contract of completing lines to Prairie du Chien and Monroe, esti- mating all stock and securities at par, $6,582, 310, an average cost per mile including side tracks, of $24,589. The increase in estimate of previous years is accounted for by extra cost of depot buildings west of Madison, $100,000: extra rolling stock, $83,000; depot grounds and other extra expenditures in Milwaukee, $90,000; discount on forfeited stock, $50,201; dividend on stock to contractors, $56,115; discount on southern Wisconsin and Milwaukee city bonds, $70,000: interest on bonds to contractors, $98,000; additional side tracks and depot buildings, $13,040; and interest on farm mortgages, $21,583. Gross earnings for the year, $680,472.80; operating expenses, $307,781.06, or 45 per cent. of gross earnings. Interest was paid on funded debt and a divi- dend of 10 per cent. declared on stock. The balance of the main line to Prairie du Chien was opened April 15, 1857, and the Southern Wisconsin line to Brodhead, September 1, 1857. At the close of the year ending December 31, 1857, the president reported the entire line completed to Prairie du Chien and Monroe, a total distance of 235 miles, in addition to 28 miles of side track, the whole valued at $6,841,627.11. The company also owned 200 miles telegraph line, $7,600; shop tools and fix- tures, $13,430; 743 acres wood land, $12,500; rolling stock, $808,980; materials and stock on hand, applicable to repairs and operating, $184,257; assets, 6-R.

The sources of the foregoing total expenditures were as follows: stock subscriptions, $1,037,832.18; city of Milwaukee, $214,000; first mortgage bonds, $450,000; floating debt, $82,131.13. Total, $1,883,963.31. The company held in reserve toward the completion of the road: stock subscriptions unpaid, to amount of $569,867.82; stock to contractors, $200,000; Portage City, $75,000; first mortgage bonds unsold, $500,000. Total, $1,344,867.82. The receipts for the year were $32,134 18, and the directors estimated that the receipts for the ensuing year would reach $400,000-sufficient to pay operating expenses, interest on bonds, sinking fund ($11,500 per annum), and dividend of 16 per cent. on capital stock paid. During the year 1856, trains commenced running to Minnesota Junction, March 6; to Rolling Prairie, March 18; to Beaver Dam, April 24; to Fox Lake, October 27; to Midland, December 29. March 29, 1856, the company contracted with Chamberlin &amp;amp; Alden to complete the road from Beaver Dam to Portage City, (about 34 miles), by the last of December of that year. The contract included grading, bridging, culverts, ties, chairs and spikes, and the laying of track, and the price to be paid was $12,000 per mile. The work and materials to be furnished under this contract contemplated a finished road, of first class, including all items of cost, except iron rails and ballasting upon those sections where suitable material could not be obtained. This contract was completed during the ensuing January. During the year 1856, nearly all the additional right of way to Portage City was purchased, and the lum- ber was purchased and delivered for fencing the whole road from Milwaukee to Portage City, and most of the fences constructed. The right of way also, was mostly secured from Portage City to Mauston (about 36 miles), as the di- rectors reported, &quot;at a moderate cost.&quot; During the year the La Crosse and Milwaukee Company purchased the Milwaukee and Watertown road, and the two roads were consolidated. In this purchase an equal amount of the stock of the La Crosse Company was paid for the stack of the Watertown Company, but the stock of the La Crosse Company was not to be paid for the stock of the Watertown company until one year after the date of the consolidation. The La Crosse Company as- sumed the debts and liabilities of the Watertown Company, and increased its stock to meet the obligations and liabilities of the purchase to the amount of $592,900. For the purpose of construction the La Crosse road was subse- quently the same year divided into five divisions: 1. Eastern Division, from Milwaukee to Portage City, 95 miles. 2. Western Division, from Portage City to La Crosse, about 101 miles, 3. Northwestern Division, from Portage City to the St. Croix, about 228 miles. 4. Watertown Division, from Junc- tion, via Watertown, to intersection of Eastern Division, estimated at 71 miles. 5. Portage Division, from Madison to Portgage City, estimated at 40 miles. Separate books were kept, exhibiting the cost of each division, the means provided and amounts of stock issued therefor. The stock of the eastern division was deemed general stock, and was entitled to dividends from and after July, 1856, prior to which time interest was paid in stock at en per cent. per annum.

CONNECTION OF PASSENGER TRAINS. One of the greatest embarrassments to comfortable traveling in this country is the frequency of failure to make connection, in passing from one line on to another. In this way much time is often lost and the most important business plans are defeated. Of course it is not possible for the companies to make close running connections between all the trains at points of intersection. But it is altogether proper that they should be required to do so when- ever it is practicable; and of this the state authorities should judge after a proper investigation. If such a regulation were enforced it would redound to the advantage of the companies, by removing one source of irritation to the traveling public, even though something were lost by allowing passengers to select their route according to their own convenience, instead of in harmony with the selfish plans of conflicting corporations. In the enforcement of a law requiring connections to be made the commissioners should be governed by principles like those laid down in the case of Barrett vs. Great Northern and Midland Rail- way Companies (England), wherein the court held that: &quot;In such case it is not necessary (sufficient) to show an individual griev. ance, but it is quite clear that a case must be made out of public inconvenience.&quot; PUNCTUALITY IN THE RUNNING OF TRAINS. Upon this subject we have remarked at considerable length under the head of Evils of Railway Management.&quot; We know of no way in which it can be certainly corrected by legislative enactment, unless the companies are required to guarantee punctuality; the passenger being enabled to recover summarily in case of delay. Such laws are in force, to some extent elsewhere, but are less ap- plicable in a new country like ours, where accidents are necessarily more frequent on account of inferiority of roads, and where delays are dependent to a good degree upon the fact that an accident to a single train is liable to delay many others. If our roads were all provided with double, instead of single, tracks, one very important element of unpunctuality would be removed. That it is an evil almost exceptional with us, may be inferred from the fact that one &apos; &quot;72 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

I have observed in the press of the state, at different times, a statement credited to His Excellency, the Governor, to the effect that this road was being operated at an average expense of forty per cent. of its gross earnings. This is far from being the case, as the operating expenses of the road will average not far from sixty per cent. of its gross earnings, leaving, say, forty per cent. for net earnings, with which (it being barely sufficient) to pay the interest on its bonded debt. It is, I presume, generally known in the state, that the road was economically built without any profit to the management or contractors, and was mortgaged for only the actual cost of construction. The country traversed is of such a nature, that some heavy grades were unavoidable, and over these grades it is impossible to haul more than sixteen loaded cars, notwithstanding our motive power is of the greatest working capacity, and of the most recent and improved manufacture, being from the justly celebrated locomotive works of Burnham, Parry, Williams &amp;amp; Co., (Baldwin Locomotive Co.) of Philadelphia. I may mention in comparison, that an engine inferior in power, can and does pull a train of thirty-two cars loaded with wheat, from the Misssissippi river over the Green Bay and Min- nesota Railway to Green Bay, with no greater consumption of fuel or train expense than is required to take a train of maximum weight (say sixteen cars) over this company&apos;s road in either direction. There are other roads in the state, the grades of which are undoubtedly as much more favorable to the movement of heavy traffic, as compared with the Green Bay road, as that road is more favorable than our own line. What applies as a disadvantage in the movement of freight, likewise affects unfavorably the movement of passenger trains on the line. It is, therefore, patent that a company operating a road through a new country and under the special disadvantages before enumerated, cannot be expected to obtain an amount of revenue above expenses, at all proportionate to the net earnings realized by competing lines, where the cost of operating, together with the amount of business in gross, is so much more favorable for such other lines. The chief traffic of this road, upon which the company must, for the pres - ent, depend for its revenue, is the movement of freight covered by the special classes, such as wheat, lumber, agricultural implements, etc., and upon these, the rates prescribed in your circular of recent date apply with terrible and ruin. ous effects. In the case of lumber, our producing points are all within, say twenty-five miles of Camp Douglas, the point at which the bulk of the ship- ments diverts to the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway-our average haul be- ing only about 16 miles―(and theirs much greater), for which our present average rate per car load of six thousand feet of lumber is, say about $13.50; while the rate proposed for our government is but eight dollars per car load for any distance within the stated twenty-five miles. Should the company be compelled to accept the prescribed rate, it would forthwith suffer a loss of nearly, if not quite, fifty per cent. in this source of revenue alone. &quot; &quot;124 Appendix. spective boards of directors mutually agreed to consolidate their respective capitals with each other and to merge and consolidate the stock of their re- spective companies, and make one joint stock company of their two railroads and to consolidate the property and stock of the said parties of the first and second parts and their respective corporations, upon the terms and condi- tions hereinafter stated and declared, which said terms and conditions have been agreed to and approved of by the board of directors of each of the said corporations at meetings duly held of said respective boards, by resolutions duly passed by said boards of directors respectively; and WHEREAS, The said parties are duly authorized by law to consolidate in the manner hereafter provided.

During a portion of the year 1868, up to the close of the year, the company operated the West Wisconsin road, as lessees. The same year an act was passed by the legislature classifying the directors of the road, and authorizing the bondholders of all classes, to cast one vote at all trustees elections for each $100 of the principal of their bonds. December 31, 1869, the directors reported an increase of 92 miles in the length of the road, viz: from Sun Prairie to Madison, in May, 12 miles; a branch line from Conover, on the Iowa and Minnesota division to Decorah, 10 miles; a branch from Mendota to St. Paul, 5%½ miles; from Schwarzburg to Wauwatosa, about 6 miles, and from Calmar to Nora Springs, about 65 miles. Total, 917 miles. The St. Paul company continued also to operate the West Wisconsin road, extended from Tomah to Augusta, about 66 miles. The construction of the Sun Prairie extension was added to capital account, at $176,628.45-$14,719 per mile; the St. Paul branch, 5½ miles, at $787,879.02 -$34,150 per mile; Decorah branch, 10 miles, at $116,999.56-$11,700 per mile; Schwarzburg to Wauwatosa, 6 miles, $163,891.05-$27,315 per mile. Other expenditures on construction and property account, increased the amount of expenditures to $1,630,533.18, in addition to $828,900 added to cap- ital for stock dividends. Total cost of road at close of year, represented by stock and debt, was stated at $35,370,772, or about $37,800 per mile. December 31, 1870, the directors reported an increase of 101 miles in the length of the road, viz: From Nora Springs to Algona, 61 miles; Austin to Mason City, 40 miles. Among the items of expenditures for the year added to total cost of road, represented by debt and stock, were the following: Second mortgage bonds, sinking fund, $72,000; new cars, $179,665; ten new locomotives, $126,450; purchase of Prairie du Chien Transit and Ferry Com- Company, $71,581; new buildings, turn-tables, etc., in Iowa, $84,182; new buildings at La Crosse, $73,172; new buildings at other points on the Mis- sisippi river, $25,000; new freight house at Milwaukee, $22,613; additional depot grounds and stock yards at Milwaukee, $27,589; additional draw- bridge at Milwaukee, $4,793; docks and canals at Milwaukee, $15,222; right of way, all lines, $15,663; winter bridge at Prairie du Chien, $15,850, and other items, making a total sum of $766,729, in addition to $828,900 paid for dividends in common stock, and $747,291 paid for dividends in cash and common stock. Dec. 31, 1871, the company reported an increase of road. The cost of the whole road-1,018 miles-up to March 1, 1871, was thus stated: mortgage bonds, $18,183,500; preferred stock, $10,825,103; common stock, $11,822,878; total cost, $40,831,481. Previous to this date, the company had purchased $2,001,000 of the capital stock of the Western Union Railroad, and paid therefor $1,500,750 in the securities of the St. Paul Company. Deducting this last sum from the total stock and debt of the St. Paul Company, the balance of $39,330,731 represents the cost of the 1,018 miles of road owned by the Mil- waukee and St. Paul-$38,650 per mile. From Dec. 31, 1869, to March 1, &quot; &apos;Executive and Legal Documents. Indeed, the state has already instituted, and will urge to the speediest possible issue, suits in the Supreme Court, involving the validity of the law. But, for the meantime, or until the law is amended or repealed, it is sufficient for your Executive, and should be enough for every corporation and every citizen, that the principle upon which it rests has been affirmed by the supreme courts of the state and of the United States, as well as by very many of the ablest jur- ists in the country, and that the statute itself has been in due form enacted and approved, and is the law of the land. If other motives were needed to insure obedience to its mandates it might easily be found in the fact that the law had its origin in a deep conviction, widely felt, that the railway corporations of the state, although the recipients of great gifts and franchises, have, in many instances, exacted excessive tolls and made unjust discriminations, to the injury of citizens and the enrichment of directors and managers, if not of stockholders; and that the very powers conferred upon them for the public good, as well as for their corporate ad- vantage, have been systematically exercised to prevent the enactment of just laws for the redress of these grievances. However this may be, it cannot be suffered that the charge of unreasona- bleness made by those whom the law seeks to restrain from extorting exces- sive rates, shall so far arraign its justice as to suspend its operation until, by the tedious processes of the courts, delayed by appeals and every possible legal artifice, its validity is at length fully determined. Submission like this on the part of the Executive and people would result in a continuance of extortionate gains by the corporations, and perhaps yet greater sacrifice by the people for years to come. Nor is this all. The delay being granted, what guaranty is to be found in the present attitude of these great corporations that they would yield a willing obedience in the event of an affirmative de- cision by the courts? If they have become so strong and independent of the state that the legislature cannot be sure of their obedience until its enact- ments are first approved by the courts, is it certain that even the courts will be able to effect a peaceable compliance? It cannot be suffered that any law, which the legislature has enacted and the Executive approved, shall be put in abeyance and treated with open disobedience and flagrant contempt by any person, corporation, or combination of corporations, on the plea of un- reasonableness, or upon any plea whatever. Such a sufferance would tend to a subversion of all legal authority. Fellow Citizens: The foregoing facts and considerations can lead but to one conclusion. As stated in my annual message, &quot;It must be admitted that railroad companies are necessary to the pros- perity and development of the state, and that in the discharge of their honor- able obligations to the public, they are entitled to the gratitude and positive and uniform protection of the legislative authority. In this matter the peo- ple will make no peace with their enemies, but they seek no war with friends. While they are willing to encourage, to the fullest extent, the developement of the railway system of our state, they cannot submit to manifest injustice, nor permit the abuse of chartered privileges.” The law must, therefore, be enforced, and with a rigor duly proportioned to the power and defiance of the offenders. It is for this reason, and because of the general misapprehension that exists as to the steps necessary to the enforcement, that I have felt it my solemn duty, after reasonable delay and the accumulation of evidence, to follow my procla mation with this plain and fuller statement of the whole case in its present aspect; setting forth the nature and enormity of this conspiracy against the law, and the danger it threatens to our fee institutions, and the imperative duty of every citizen to lend his aid in putting it down. The law clearly defines the obligations of the railway corporations, and provides ample remedies for its violation But the legislature, anticipating no such extraordinary and flagrant violation and contempt of its statutes, has made no provision to enable either the Executive or the Railroad Commission- ers to meet the emergency with extraordinary means. It is simply provided that every infraction should be punished by the ordinary means of prose- cutiing to conviction and punishment by fine and damages, every offender. It naturally assumed that the people, who had so repeatedly made the charge of extortion and oppression, only waited for an opportunity to apply the remedy &apos; &quot;Railway Statistics. 165 SUPERIOR AND ST.

They are chiefly affidavits of well known men of high character and standing, of great experience in the affairs of railroads, and specially conversant with these roads. And we may well be permitted to say here that there is great cause for regret, that these men and others like them, ac- quainted with the state and its people, their resources and their needs, and likely to act in sympathy with them as well as for the true interest of the roads, have not been independent in the local management of these corpora- tions. If they had been, we are quite confident that there would have been no cause for this unfortunate controversy. But the affidavits, after all, give us only their theories, which do not satisfy us of the ruin which they fore- tell. Still the appeals seemed so urgent or so sincere that they left impres sion enough on our minds, to make us somewhat reluctant to grant the writs. But we have no discretion to disregard our plain duty. It is true that it said that the granting or withholding of an injunction rests in the sound discretion of the court. But that is judicial discretion, not wilful choice. And the rule is applied to injunctions in aid of private rem- edies. The same rule applies to mandamus in cases of private right But it does not apply to the application of the writ to things publici juris. There the writ goes ex debito justicia. The court has no discretion to withhold it. Tapping, 287. We need not repeat here the analogies already stated between the two writs used as prerogative or quasi prerogative writs, to protect public right. And we have no more discretion to withhold injunction to restrain violation of public right, than to withhold mandamus to enforce public duty. We have held that here is positive violation of positive public law to posi- tive public injury, and that we have jurisdiction or this writ, as a prerogative writ, to restrain it.There is no room for discretion. The duty is positive, ex dibito justicia. The discretion which we were urged to exercise would be discretion to permit the violation of the laws which we sit here to enforce. It was said to us by counsel, in a professional and not offer sive sense, that we dare not issue these injunctions. We reply that, holding what we have held, we dare not face the judgment of the profession for withholding them. We disregard the appeal made to us reluctantly. But it is not to us that such appeal should be made. We had no part in promoting these cases. We have no voluntary part in the decision of them. We only obey the law as we understand it. We cannot care for consequences. We must do our duty, be the consequences what they may. If such appeal be fit, it is fit to make to the attorney general, not to us. He can heed it. We cannot. But while we have no discretion, we have power to impose terms which seem to us just. We have already expressed the opinion that the informations in the nature of quo warranto, pending in this court against these defendants, are not a bar to these informations, and our reasons why this may be consid- ered the better remedy. But we do not think that the attorney general should have both remedies at once. He has an election, but he must elect. If he has these injunctions, he should dismiss those informations. And time will be necessary to these defendants to arrange the change of rates. We presume that the remaining half of this month will be adequate. And, therefore, before these injunctions issue, we require the attorney gen- eral to dismiss the pending informations in the nature of quo warranto, and to file in these causes a stipulation signed by him ex officio, and approved by the court, or one of the judges of the court, that the state will not proceed by way of quo warranto for forfeiture or for contempt in violating the injunction to issue against the defendants, for any violation of the provisions of chapter 273 of 1874, involved in these causes, done or suffered to be done prior to the first day of October next. If the time allowed for the change should be found insufficient, the defend. ants may move, on notice and proper proofs, to enlarge it on either of the re- maining Tuesdays of this month. On the terms stated, the injunctions will issue as to all the roads of the Chicago and Northwestern Company, and as to all the roads of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Company, except the road from Milwaukee to Prairie du Chien, built under the territorial charter of 1847, 1848. If the Attorney General should be advised that the corporation under the &quot; &apos;24 Appendix. ORDER OF THE COURT. State of Wisconsin-Supreme Court. THE STATE OF WISCONSIN VS. THE CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL RAILWAY COMPANY. On reading and filing the petition of A. Scott Sloan, Attorney General of the state of Wisconsin, It is ordered that leave be and the same is hereby granted to the Attorney General to bring an action in the nature of a quo warranto, in the supreme court, in the name of the state of Wisconsin, against the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railway Company, a corporation, other than municipal, created and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Wisconsin, for the purpose of vacating the charter and annulling the existance of said corporation as prayed for in said petition. PETITION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. In Supreme Court. THE STATE OF WISCONSIN V. THE CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE AND ST. PAUL RAILWAY COMPANY. The above named plaintiff, the State of Wisconsin, by A. Scott Sloan, At- torney General of the said state of Wisconsin, by leave of the court for that purpose, first duly had and obtained complains of the above named defend- ant, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, and informs the court and shows and alleges that the said Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railay Company is a corporation duly created, organized and existing by the laws of the state of Wisconsin. That the said Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company was in- corporated under the statute laws of the state of Wisconsin under the name of the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, by filing articles of associa- tion in the office of Secretary of State of the State of Wisconsin, on the 5th day of May, A. D. 1863, which said articles of association were amended by an act of the legislature of the state of Wisconsin, entitled &quot;an act to amend the articles of association of the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company,&quot; approved April 2, A. D., 1864. That said articles of association were ratified and confirmed, and said com- pany was among other things declared to be a corporation by an act of the legislature of the state of Wisconsin, entitled &quot;an act ratifying the organiza- tion of a corporation therein named,&quot; approved April 10, 1865. That at a meeting of the said Milwaukee &amp;amp; St. Paul Railway Company, held in the city of Milwaukee on the 7th day of February, 1874, at which were present, personally or by proxy, a majority of all its shareholders, the name of said company was changed to the &quot; Chicago, Milwaukee &amp;amp; St. Paul Railway Company&quot; by a resolution unanimously adopted, which reso- lution was duly recorded in the office of the Secretary of State of the state of Wisconsin, on the 11th day of February, 1874. And the plaintiff further shows, that the said defendant, on the first day of January, 1874, owned and operated about six hundred miles of railroad within the said state of Wisconsin, and ever since that time has used, man- aged and operated the same in the transportation of freights and passengers upon its said railroad. &apos; &quot;&quot; &quot;12 Report of Railroad Commissioners. Again, should this company be compelled to pro rate with the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company, and accept its proportion of the through rates pro- vided by the so called Potter Law, according to its actual distance, its reve- nue would be reduced at least seventy-five per cent., and it would be unable to collect one-half of the actual cost of performing the service (including use of cars, etc.), thus destroying at one fell blow, the entire lumber producing interests upon this line. Let me here say, that so far as I have been informed, our lumber rates have heretofore given general satisfaction to everybody con- cerned. A careful analysis and comparison of rates on wheat, agricultural imple- ments and other enumerated specials, shows that our revenue from their trans- portation would be reduced from forty-five to sixty per cent., or upon an av- erage, more than fifty per cent., providing that the company should be obliged to accept the proposed special and reduced rates, provided by your announced schedule. A comparison made by yourselves, upon basis of the printed tariffs sent you herewith, will fully justify these conclusions, and will, I am sure, con- vince your honorable board and all other fair minded men, that it will be in- expedient upon the part of the state authorities or any of the people of the state, to jeopardize and undoubtedly destroy all future usefulness of this line as a carrier of freights or passengers. To such as will, through ignorance or mistaken zeal, contribute to so disastrous a result, will, for all time, be at- tached a grave responsibility, and the people of this section, whose dearest interests are so vitally dependent upon the continued operation of the road, will assuredly not fail to hold them to a strict accountability for the grievous wrong sustained through the violation of the best faith of the commonwealth, and by the suppression of a corporation created expressly by virtue of that faith. Having a firm confidence in the future greatness of this state, we desire to continue to operate the line upon terms just and fair, as between the patrons of the road and those gentlemen who, relying upon the personal integrity of its management and the provisions of its charter as guaranteed by the state, have invested their capital in the enterprise; and we believe that much can and will be done through such continued operation, towards the advancement of the best material interests-both manufacturing and producing-of north- western Wisconsin. It is earnestly to be hoped that this great question will soon cease to be made use of by designing and unscrupulous politicians, in order to secure preferment from a deluded people, which they could never hope to obtain upon their merits as men, and that an industrious and intelligent people will soon realize that it is through the encouraging and fostering of all legitimate railroad enterprises-both new and old-that the continued development of the natural resources and solid property of Wisconsin most largely depends. In conclusion, I beg to assure you, gentleman, that we wish at all times to show equal and proper respect to the laws of our state and the rights of all with whom we may have business relations; and if at present, the reduced &quot; &quot;104 Report of Railroad Commissioners. $250,000; fencing, $16,800; buildings, $17,000; engineering and incidentals&apos; $13,733.31; interest and discounts, $20,000. This estimate would make a total cost from Beloit to Madison, actual and estimated, $915,000—or about $19,200 per mile. FACTS CONCERNING BRANCHES AND LEASED LINES. THE WINONA AND ST. PETER RAILROAD.- The Winona and St. Peter Rail- road, included among the roads leased and operated by the Chicago and Northwestern company, was charted by the Minnesota Legislature March 3, 1855, under the name of &amp;quot;Transit Railroad Company.&amp;quot; It runs from Winona northwesterly to Minnesota state line, and thence to Lake Kam. peska, in the teritory of Dakota. Work first commenced on the line in 1858, and a portion of the line was first opened for traffic in 1863. The entire line was not completed until August, 1873. The total length of road in Minneso - ta is 288 miles; in Dakata, 38½ miles. Total length of road, 326½ miles, exclusive of about 18 miles of siding and other tracks. In 1873 the com- pany owned 27 passenger and freight stations, 23 water stations, 18 spans of bridges of 25 feet and upwards, 1,530 feet of truss bridges, 1 machine shop and 6 engine houses. Its rolling stock embraced 31 locomotives of the average weight of 28 tons, 3 snow plows, 7 passenger cars, 4 mail and bag- gage cars, 1,000 freight cars, and 132 platform cars. This road, thus equipped, is made to bear a bonded debt of nine million dollars, or about $27,000 per mile in addition to the capital stock. The total cost of the road, repre- sented by capital stock, bonds and unfunded debt, as reported by the rail- road commissioners for Minnesota Aug. 31, 1873, was $10,604,878.74, or an average of about $32,000 per mile. The total net income of the road for the year ending at the date given, was but $142,407.10. The cost of the road given is in addition to a land grant estimated at 1,500,000 acres, much of which has been sold at an average rate of $6.47 per acre. As to the manner in which a considerable portion of the bonds belonging to this road, were disposed of, we call attention to the copy of an agreement with Danford N. Barney, and others, (Appendix 118.) The late railroad commissioner of Minnesota, in his report for the year ending Aug. 31, 1873, estimates the average actual cost of this road with equipments as follows: (See Minnesota Report—p. lxix.) WINONA, MANKATO &amp;amp; NEW ULM RAILROAD.-This company was organized under the general laws of the state of Minnesota, June 1, 1870, and work commenced on the line in July of the same year. It extends from Mankato. Junction to Mankato—a distance of 34 miles-and is operated by the Wi- nona and St. Peter Company, and with the same rolling stock. The capital stock and debt of the company in August, 1873, was $48,688.19 per mile. The gross earnings for the year ending at the same date were reported at $1,275.65 per mile, and its operating expenses at $2,549.61 per mile—a loss of $1,273.96 for each mile operated, besides interest on stock and debt. &quot; &quot;Executive and Legal Documents. 39 1 by the third clause of section 3, article VII., of the constitution, in which in junction is the appropriate remedial writ. The original jurisdiction of the court by way of injunction being thus set- tled, no question was made on the argument, and it is not perceived how any could well be, of our jurisdiction to entertain the informations in these causes, if they make a case for equitable cognizance. II. But equitable jurisdiction of such informations was denied. It was argued that the courts of equity have no jurisdiction, at the suit of the Attor- ney General, to enjoin usurpation, excess or abuse of corporate franchises. This question was argued very ably and at large, and has been carefully considered, although we have had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that courts of equity have such jurisdiction, and that it is a very beneficial jurisdiction, almost essential to public order and welfare. It was hardly denied that the English court of chancery entertains juris- diction in such cases, and indeed the English books leave little room for such a denial. But it was said that, in England, the Attorney General had a right to elect his forum, legal or equitable. And it is so said in some of the cases. Attor- ney General v. Mayor of Galway, 1 Molloy 103. But it appears to us that this logically follows, everywhere, upon equitable jurisdiction to restrain cor- porate violations of charters or other public law. In such cases there is always a remedy at law. The Attorney General may proceed at law by quo warranto to forfeit the charter of the offending corporation, and, if there be a penalty, as often happens, he may sue for it at law. And the concurrent remedy by injunction, inevitably give the election imputed to the Attorney General. And we see no reasor why the Attorney General here, has not the same election. To deny him such an election, is only another way of deny- ing the jurisdiction. 1 The equitable jurisdiction precludes the objection that there is an adequate remedy at law. It admits the remedy at law, but administers its own remedy in preference, when the state seeks it in preference. It seems to proceed on the presumption that it may better serve the public interest to restrain a corporation, than to punish it by penal remedies or to forfeit its charter; and that, in that view, the proper officers of the state should have an election of remedies. And we may as well say in this connection, that the jurisdiction to entertain these informations is wholly independent of an adequate remedy at law; and that, were that otherwise, we could not consider the informa tions in the nature of quo warranto, pending in this court against these defendants, as an adequate remedy at law, which could be a substitute for or bar to the injunctions asked. Judgments of ouster on those informations might not only be of far more grave consequence to the defendants, but might be far less beneficial to the state, and less accordant with its policy, and altogether less equitable and proper, than the injunctions sought to res- train the defendants from doing what is alleged to work a forfeiture of their charters. Doubtless the court has power in granting injunctions, to prescribe conditions controlling the action of the Attorney General in the qur warranto cases. But if this court can enjoin, it can do so without regard to any remedy at law; and the Attorney General has a right of election to resort to the mere lenient remedy of injunction, in preference to the harsher and more dangerous experiment of forfeiture. It was further urged for the defendants, against the authority of the Eng- lish cases, that the jurisdiction of the English chancery in such cases, rests largely on recent acts of Parliament. And we were referred, in support of that position, to the railway and canal traffic act of 1854, and to the common law procedure act of the same year, (17 and 18 Vict., ch. 31; ch. 127.) We have carefully examined these statutes, and Mr. Joice&apos;s comments upon them. We find that the former of them enlarged the powers of some of the common law courts and gave them jurisdiction of certain summary proceeedings and the equitable writ of injunction for certain purposes, against railway and canal companies. The second of these acts gives some equitable powers, and the writ of injunction, in certain cases, to courts of common law. But we fail to discover that either of these statutes adds anything to the jurisdiction of courts of equity. In this connection we were led also to examine the rail &quot; &quot;General Investigations. 47 would permit of the general subject of railroad management and control of railway corporations, and to make a faithful report of the results of such labors. NATURE OF THE CONTROVERSY. Transportation is a matter that touches, in some important way, every branch of industry and every interest of society. No com- munity is unaffected by the cost of transportation, because none either produces all it consmues, or consumes all it produces. The same is true of each individual member of society. Hence com- merce is as old as civilization, and has of necessity been as unrest- ing as the forces of nature; plying at first upon inland seas, along the ocean shores, and upon the navigable rivers, which by a wise provision of nature open highways into the interior of continents; later still upon the oceans themselves, and last of all building for itself artificial highways over vast regions otherwise practically in- accessible. At the beginning, these highways were canals and wagon-roads. But the former, besides being too costly for such multiplication as would accommodate all sections of country, were scarcely available for travel, and hence practically left the inhabitants of interior portions comparatively isolated, and to a great extent denied the benefits of that spirit of progress which comes of commercial activity and frequency of intercourse with other communities and nations. Thus it was that highways upon land, equal in capacity to the transportation of vast quantities of raw material and the products of manufacturing industry became a necessity. Railways are the result of this imperative demand. And the amazing rapidity with which they have multiplied, extended, and ramified over vast regions on all the continents, becoming thus the open paths of a new civilization, is the distinguishing feature of the industrial pro- gress of this marvelous age. It is manifest that this rapid growth of railway enterprise could not have been made without the united effort of capitalists and the expenditure of vast sums of money. Again, it is natural that capitalists, who are few and powerful, whose chief aim it is to increase their wealth, and who, by reason of the very nature of their undertakings, must possess those other elements of strength, organization and singleness of purpose, should &quot; &quot;150 Appendix. CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN RAILROAD COMPANY AND GALENA AND CHICAGO UNION RAILROAD COMPANY. CONSOLIDATION. Articles of agreement and consolidation made the second day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, A. D. (1864), by and between the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, duly formed and organized under franchises to be a corporation, granted by the states of Wisconsin and Illinois, party of the first part, and the Galena and Chicago Union Railway Company, duly formed and organized under a fran- chise to be a corporation, granted by the state of Illinois, party of the second part, witnesseth: WHEREAS, The said parties of the first and second parts are desirous of consolidating with each other, and are duly authorized by law to effect such consolidation as hereinafter provided; and WHEREAS, The said parties of the first and second parts have agreed upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth as the terms and conditions of such consolidation and have fixed upon and regulated the proceedings for the purpose of such consolidation. by by-laws duly established by them respect- ively, and these articles are framed and extended in pursuance of such by- laws; and WHEREAS, The terms of such consolidation have been approved of by a majority of the stockholders of the respective parties hereto in interest in person or by proxy at annual meetings duly held by them respectively; and WHEREAS, The said party of the first part has become vested with all the railroad property, franchises, privileges and rights formerly held by the Dixon, Rockford and Kenosha Railway Company by consolidation duly made with the said company. Now, therefore, this agreement witnesseth, that in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants, promises and grants herein contained, the said parties of the first and second parts do, by these presents, merge, combine and consolidate their respective capital stocks, franchises, grants, immunities, privileges, capacities, properties and rights of every name and nature, into one company, to be called and known by the corporate name and style of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, which said consolidated com- pany shall from henceforth have and possess all and singular the rights, fran- chises, powers, immunities, privileges and capacities which are or have been granted to, or conferred upon, or possessed or enjoyed by either of the said parties hereto, by or under the laws or enactments of the said states of Illi- nois or Wisconsin, or of either of the said states. And this agreement further witnesseth, that the said parties of the first and second parts have agreed upon, and by these presents do agree upon and pre- scribe the following as the terms and conditions the said parties of the first and second parts mutually covenant, promise and agree to observe, keep and perform, viz: Article First. The persons who shall be directors of the Chicago and North- western Railroad Company, at the time of such consolidation, shall be the first directors of the said consolidated company, and shall act as such until the next annual election of directors, as is herein prescribed, and until their suc- cessors are duly elected. Article Second. The number of the directors of the said consolidated com- pany shall be not less than thirteen, and not more than seventeen. The board, as consolidated by the preceding article, may, in their discretion, fill up their number to seventeen. The number for any year, within such limits as are established by law, may be fixed at the annual meeting of the stockholders by a by-law adopted at such meeting. Article third. The first regular annual meeting of the stockholders, or the stock and bondholders of the said consolidated company, shall be held on the first Thursday in June, 1865. Special meetings may be called at any time by a majority of the said board of directors. The board of directors of the said consolidated company shall, at their first meeting appoint all necessary &quot; &quot;128 Appendix. to proceed to foreclose said mortgage in the manner provided for in said in- strument, and that a very large sum of money has been expended in the con- struction of said road, which, owing to its present unfinished state, would now sell but for a small portion of its cost, and therefore cause great loss to the present holders of its securities if it was summarily closed up; and WHEREAS, It is further represented to the undersigned that influential and responsible parties, principally located along the line of said road, who will be benefited by its construction, have come forward and made a large condi- tional fresh subscription of eight hundred thousand dollars or thereabouts sufficient to insure its completion, the same to be in full force and effect, pro- vided the present mortgage bonds are surrendered, previous to April 1, 1855, and converted into stock at par in the present corporation or in a new or- ganization hereafter to be founded, in case said sale, as recommended, should be made by said trustee, in which event it is further represented the existing corporation would necessarily be forced into liquidation. Now, therefore, we, the undersigned holders of the first mortgage bonds of the said Rock River Valley, Union Railroad Company, to the amount set op- posite our respective names hereto, either as the owners of the same in fee, or as holders of the same as collateral, in trust or otherwise, hereby irrevoca- bly constitute and appoint William B Ogden, Esq., of Chicago, Illinois, and John H.

We hereby, accordingly, each for himself and not one for the other, respect- ively agree that we will receive from our said agents or attorneys, or from other parties who may be authorized to issue the same under the existing or any future organization which shall be made of said company, its road, prop- erty and interest subsequent to and in pursuant of such sale and purchase by our said agents or attorneys as aforesaid, full paid up stock of the same at par, to the full amount of the bonds set opposite our respective names hereto, and the interest thereon. And we hereby further authorize our said attorneys acting in this behalf, to issue or cause and obtain from the proper source and authority the issue of like stock at par to any and all other bona fide bond holders, stock holders and just creditors at the time of the said sale of the Rock River Valley Union Railroad to the full amount of their respective bonds and stock, and likewise for the full amount of all claims and demands or to such lesser amount of the latter as they shall respectively deem them to be justly and equitably entitled to as creditors of said company, upon receiv. ing from them respectively in return the surrender and cancelment of all such bonds, stock and demands. In case any of said bond holders, not parties hereto, shall fail to agree to such surrender and conversion of their bonds into stock previous to said sale, it shall then be optional with our said agents or attorneys to give certificates of stock therefor, if applied for in exchange for such bonds, or to pay to such bond holders their pro rata proportion of the proceeds of such sale in cash.

GENTLEMEN: I was sick and unable to make this statement last week as I intended, and I have not now been able to do more then give the balances of the several accounts which enter into the cost of the road. There are many things which ordinarily enter into the cost of a railroad which do not appear here. For instance no salaries were paid to any officer during the work excepting $2,500 per annum to the superintendent, and $300 to the secretary. Engineers were employed by the month and discharged when their work was done. The president and directors, when engaged in the business, were refunded money actually expended by them only.

The form prescribed is not only deficient in detail, but indefinite in arrangement and purpose. STATE LINES AND THEIR EXTRA-STATE CONNECTIONS. It is clear to us that no satisfactory solution of the question of railway obligations to the public can be attained without a more intelligible basis of estimate than has hitherto been ascertained, of the exact relations of these companies to those portions of their lines lying without the state. Most of the charges relating to ir- regular management and expenditure refer to these collateral lines and to the contracts under which they were acquired. The statis- tics we have presented hereinafter will sufficiently illustrate the results, at least, of some of these complications. They show that roads are often purchased or constructed outside the state which bear no just proportion of the general burden of expenditure, and which, for all present time, certainly, must serve simply to consume the receipts from more profitable, if not actually less costly por- tions of the line. Indirectly, but nevertheless actually, the extra burdens thus imposed upon the older and more remunerative por- tions of the road, become a tax upon our own people. It is true, that extensions of our railway system, by means of le- gitimate purchase or other expenditure, are most ardently to be desired. Ultimately, at the worst, such extensions are undoubtedly to become a source of profit to the general company which pro- motes them, and also a means of facilitating personal communica- tion and commercial exchanges. How far these extensions should be promoted at the cost of home lines, is a question of policy de- serving serious consideration. Certainly, no merely speculative expenditure in this direction should be recognized as a proper charge upon our domestic interests; but it is equally clear that the promotion of the general interest, by every legitimate enlargement of our railway system, and an extension of the sources of profit for home lines, is not to be captiously discouraged. STATISTICAL SUMMARY. The reports of Wisconsin railway companies for the year ending December 31, 1873, show the following totals: &quot; &apos;Determination of Cost. 19 any part of such indebtedness has been incurred in consequence of the con- struction, maintenance, repair, removal or operation of any part of such rail. road which is not in this state, or for equipment for such part, such railroad commissioners shall ascertain and determine in such manner as they shall think just and equitable, how much of its indebtedness is justly chargeable to that part of said railroad that is in this state, and how much interest shall have been paid by such company during such year ending on the 31st day of the next preceding December, on that part of such indebtedness which is justly chargeable to that part of said railroad that is in this state.&quot; THE QUESTION OF ACTUAL COST. It would be presumption to assume, under the most favorable circumstances, that an investigation such as that required by the law, involving the complicated history of railroad construction and management in this state for more than twenty years, could be con- ducted to exact conclusions within a term of six or eight months. The commissioners, in fact, have much reason to doubt whether the question of &quot;actual cost can ever be determined with precision, from any data at present or heretofore in existence, either by the state or even by the owners and managers of the property. The elements of cost often include exchanges of value under every pos- sible form, and under all conceivable circumstances, with no record preserved, except of the nominal sums paid and received. In orig- inal railway construction, bonds and stock are exchanged indiffer- ently, for labor or property; sometimes sold for money, hypothe- cated for loans, donated for contingent purposes, divided as inter- est on investment, or sacrificed wholly on sale and foreclosure. Oftentimes the record is itself wanting, and even nominal amounts of investment become the subject of speculative estimate. The law, however, has left to the commissioners no alternative as to this branch of investigation; and, accordingly, the commissioners have applied themselves to this task as industriously as possible, presenting as the result- First-Such facts as were to be gathered from the official reports of the several railway companies from the date of their organization to the present time (see pages 78–185 of this report); Secondly-Estimates made by the companies themselves of the present cash value of their several lines respectively, or statements of actual cost as recorded upon their books, (see pp. 186–226); and, Thirdly - Such calculations as could be made on the basis of the market value of the stock and bonds of the two principal corpora- tions. &apos; &quot;Records of Railway Companies. 103 dend of seven per centum per annum from the net earnings of each annual year, after payment of interest on all the mortgage bonds, if the company earn so much during the annual year, and before the payment of dividends to any other class of stockholders; but the company may reserve a reasonable working capital or surplus, before the dividend shall be declared or paid on said preferred stock, which surplus shall not exceed, at any time, the aggre- gate sum of $250,000 over and above the floating or unfunded debt and the annual interest on the mortgage bonds. If the net earnings of the company are not as much as seven per cent. in any one year, then the said preferred stock shall receive for that year a dividend of whatever the said net earnings are, after the payment of interest on the mortgage bonds and the reasonable reserve for a working capital as above described. Said preferred stock shall not have any claim upon the earnings of any after year for the nonpayment of dividends of any preceding year. And whenever the company earns sufficient, over and above the payment of interest on the bonds and the reserve above named, to pay a greater sum than seven per cent on said outstanding preferred stock and seven per cent, on the common stock, then the said preferred stock shall share pro rata with the common stock in such earnings Fourth. The directors of the company shall have power to increase the said capital stock, as follows, viz: To acquire by purchase or otherwise, either the road and property now known as the eastern division of the La Crosse &amp;amp; Milwaukee Railroad Company, or any bonds secured by mortgage thereon, the sum of $4,000,000, which shall be subdivided as follows: Into the preferred stock named in the third article hereof, and in addition thereto, and as a part thereof, $2,750,000, or 27,500 shares, of which $2,000,000 or 20,000 shares shall be designated as scrip preferred stock of the same class, and to be issued and used in the same manner as is provided in the third article hereof; the balance of said $4,000,000 increase, $1.250,000, or 12,500 shares, shall be in addition thereto, and as a part thereof of the common stock, aš provided in said third article. And if at any time the directors deem it for the best interest of the com- pany to acquire by purchase or otherwise, the road and property now known as the Milwaukee and Western Railroad, commonly called the Watertown road, or any bonds of said road secured by mortgage thereof, then, and to that end, and for the construction thereof from Columbus to Portage, and for other uses of the company, the directors are hereby authorized to increase the capital stock, and to issue the like amount of bonds, preferred stock, scrip stock and common stock, as named in the previous paragraph of this article and in addition thereto. And if at any time the directors deem it for the interest of this company to acquire, by purchase or otherwise, the road or property now known as the Milwaukee and Horicon Railroad, or any bonds of said company secured by mortgage of said road, then, and to that end. the directors are hereby author- ized to increase the capital stock, and to issue it in addition to the amount previously stated, as follows, viz: of the preferred stock, $800,000, or 8,000 shares, of which $400,000, or 4,000 shares, shall be designated as scrip pre- ferred stock, of the same class, and to be issued and used in the same manner as is above provided, and to issue of the common stock $250,000, or 2,500 shares. If at any time the directors deem it for the interest of this company to ac- quire, by purchase or otherwise, the road or property of any railroad com- pany connecting with the railroad of this company, and which they are now or hereafter shall be authorized by the laws of Wisconsin to consolidate or join stock with, then and to that end the directors of this company are here- by authorized to increase and issue either or both classes of its capital stock, in addition to the amount above provided, to an amount not exceeding the gross amount of the capital stock of the company acquired, consolidated or joined stock with. Fifth. This corporation shall have all the powers, privileges and immuni- ties of said railroad companies, under the laws of Wisconsin, and especially to sue and be sued, to acquire use and sell, bargain, lease and convey all kinds of property, real and personal, necessary or convenient to operate, use and maintain said railroad, or the part or the whole of any other railroad hereafter acquired by them within the state of Wisconsin. To make any by- &quot; &quot;Remedial Measures. 101 As already stated, the investigations in England have not led to the adoption of this theory, and the objections which apply in that country exist to a much greater degree in the United States. Executive supervision, or the commissioner system, seems now more likely to lead to the establishment of conditions approximat- ing non-interference than state ownership. Agreeing that the law, as it stands, is not an adequate remedy for the evils it was intended to cure, and that state ownership can- not be adopted as a remedy, we come now to consider such meas- ures as do commend themselves to cur attention. RAILWAY COMPETITION TO SOME EXTENT AVAILABLE. That competition between railway companies is not of itself a sufficient reliance has been fully shown; as also that it has been long since abandoned throughout the world. It is, nevertheless, every- where operative to some extent, and under favorable circumstances may be employed with advantage; e. g.: where two great corpora- tions forbidden to consolidate are yet so located and otherwise cir- cumstanced as to be natural competitors. As has been the case so often in the past, they may weary of the contest, from time to time, and come to an agreement as to rates. But if they are really natural competitors, they will at least com- pete as to facilities and accommodations. WATER-ROUTES A PERMANENT THOUGH PARTIAL RESTRAINT. All experience in every country testifies to the truth of the above statement. It is also a teaching of experience, now confirm- ed by every authority on transportation, that the influence of water-routes extends far beyond the regions of country immediate- ly bordering on their lines. In 1872, persons considered competent authority, stated before the British Joint Select Committee on Railroad Amalgamations, that sea compeittion had the effect to lower the tariff rates at about three-fifths of all the railway stations in the United Kingdom. In this country, the influence of lake and river competition is felt at long distances. Indeed, there is little doubt but that the great chain of lakes affording, in connection with the Erie Canal and the Hudson river, water communication between the sea board and the northwestern states, save, and will always continue to save &quot; &apos;Remedial Measures. 103 The direct influence of water lines of transportation on railway transportation is well illustrated by the following statement from the report of the Senate Committee, showing the difference between summer rates and winter rates by rail: AVERAGE monthly freight charges per bushel on wheat from Milwaukee and Chicago to New York by water (lakes, Erie canal and Hudson river), by lake and rail (lake to Buffalo and thence all rail to New York), and by all rail 1870 to 1872 inclusive.

Brown, 3 Wis., p. 603, Mr. Justice Smith, after referring to the doctrine established in the Dartmouth College case, proceeds to say, &amp;quot;it is competent, nevertheless, for each state by constitutional regula- tion or specific legislative enactment, to reserve the power to modify or re- peal all such acts of incorporation, where the power of modification or repeal is reserved, either in the one mode or the other; it is obvious that the grantees must rely for the perpetuity and integrity of the franchise granted to them, solely upon the faith of the sovereign grantor * * and all such corporations now rest upon the faith of the state, taking care to deserve its favor or command its justice by observing strictly the limits of their powers and accomplishing by all legitimate means the objects of their creation.&amp;quot; And in Nazro v. Merchants&apos; Ins. Co., 14 Wis., p. 295, Chief Justice Dixon, in discussing an amendment to the charter of the defendant company, author- izing the trustees to adopt a new mode of insurance, makes use of this lan- guage: &amp;quot;This is a grant to the trustees of new and distinct powers, such as they could not before have exercised, either as a matter of corporate author- ity, or of legal or constitutional right as between themselves or the corpora- tion and stockholders. The latter might have objected to it as a violation of the contract under which they became members of the company. But for the reserved power of the legislature to alter or repeal the charter, this objec- tion would be still open to them.&amp;quot; And in Chapin and another v. Crusen and another, 31 Wis., p. 209, Mr. Jus- tice Lyon, in discussing the power of the legislature to repeal the grant of a ferry franchise before the expiration of the time for which it was to continue by the original act, and to confer the franchise upon another person, holds that such power existed as to an individual, because the grant did not amount to a contract; and he adds: &amp;quot;These views may perhaps be strength- ened by the provisions of the constitution, Art. XI, Šec. 1, which give the legislature power to alter or repeal the charter of corporations created by it. Had this franchise been conferred on such a corporation, there can be no doubt that the legislature might take it away.&amp;quot; These citations sufficiently show the opinions entertained by the courts of our own state, as to the design and extent of the reservation, and seem to warrant the conclusion that there can be no such limitation of the power as is now claimed for it, or that can affect the validity of the law under consid- eration; and the adjudications in the courts of other states, and of the su- preme court of the United States, are in entire harmony with our own, and abundantly sustain the legislation of last session and its constitutional validity. The case of McLaren v. Pennington, 1 Paige, ch. p. 102, was where the legis- lature of New Jersey had incorporated a bank to continue not exceeding twenty-one years, with a proviso that it should be lawful for the legislature at any time to repeal the charter. As a consideration for the charter, the sum of $25,000 was to be paid by the bank to the treasurer of the state. The bank was organized in June; it paid into the treasury of the state the $25,000, and commenced operations. In the November following the legislature repealed the act of incorporation, and the court held, Chancellor Walworth delivering the opinion, not only that the power to repeal existed under the reservation, but that the court would not presume it to have been improperly exercised. The case of Crease v. Babcock, 23 Pick. p. 334, was where a bank of which the defendant was a stockholder had been incorporated and with power to repeal reserved only in case of some violation of the charter or other default. In that state stockholders were only liable individually, on the expiration of the charter, and the defendant insisted that under the clause reserving the right to repeal the charter, the default of the bank must first be ascertained and determined by the courts, and that until that were done, the legislature could not exercise the power of repeal. Eut the court held that the acceptance of the charter made a compact under which the legislature could repeal “and the grantees could have no reason to complain of the execution of their own contract.&amp;quot; The court also held that they would presume that the contin- gency upon which the right to repeal depended, had happened. &quot; &quot;120 Appendix. ly from Winona aforesaid; it being understood that the said parties of the first part shall receive as manny acres as shall be received by the party of the second part for the construction of said one hundred and five miles, or so much thereof as is now constructed, notwithstanding that under the act of Congress the said lands are certified only upon the completion of sections of not less than ten miles of railroads, but reserving, excepting and deduc- ting from the said number of acres all lands necessary for the track of said railroad, or the right of way, or depot grounds, or other purposes inci- dental to the operation of said railroad. And the said party of the second part agrees to acquire the title of said lands as fast as it may be permitted to do under said act of congress, and to release and convey to the said parties of the first part, or to such person or persons in such manner, and from time to time, as may be devised by the par- ties of the first part, or their counsel, on the request of the parties of the first part, or a majority of them, and will do any and every other act and thing necessary and proper to secure the said parties of the first part said lands, and every part and parcel thereof, and the proceeds thereof, if it shall be hereafter determined that the same shall be sold by the said party of the second part, for the benefit of the said parties of the first part; and until the final arrange- ments shall be made in reference thereto, the title shall be held by the said party of the second part; and as some time is necessary to enable said parties of the first part to confer and agree upon the details in relation to the hold- ing of the title and the mode of disposing of said lands, this clause is insert- ed to express the agreement of said parties in relation thereto. And it is further agreed by and between the parties hereto, that the said parties of the first part shall have and take all the cash assets of the said par- ty of the second part, up to the first day of November, 1867, and that the said parties of the first part shall assume and agree to pay, and that they shall fully pay and discharge all the floating debts of the said party of the second part up to the said first day of November, 1867, and all liabilities thereof to that date, except bonded debt, and including the interest to the said first day of November, 1867, whieh shall have accrued upon the outstanding bonds of the party of the second part, and which will amount at said date to the sum of forty-nine thousand dollars. And the said parties of the first part hereby covenant, promise and agree to and with the said party of the second part, that the said parties of the first part shall and will receive and accept the property and things herein before agreed to be transferred to them in full payment, satisfaction and discharge of all indebtedness of the said party of the second part to the said parties of the first part, or either of them. And it is hereby further declared and agreed, that it shall be optional with the said party of the second part whether or not the said party of the second part shall construct the said railroad to any point beyond that to which it is now completed; but if the said party of the second part shall not, on or be- fore the first day of February, 1869, resolve to undertake the construction of said railroad to the first crossing of the Minnesota river, at or near Mankato, a distance of about twenty-four miles, and notify the said parties of the first part, or some of them, that it will undertake such construction, the said par- ties of the first part shall then, to wit, from and after the said first day of Feb- ruary 1869, become entitled and be suffered and be permitted at their own elec- tion, to undertake the construction of said road to the said first crossing at or near Mankato aforesaid, and to complete the same within fifteen months from the said first of February, 1869, at the proper cost and expense of the parties of the first part, but for the use and benefit of the party of the second part, upon the terms following, that is to say: the said party of the second part, electing not to construct said railroad to the said first crossing at or near Mankato aforesaid, and the said parties of the first part, within fifteen months from the said first day of February, 1869, undertaking such construction as aforesaid, the said party of the second part shall issue and deliver to the said parties of the first part, from time to time, as the work of construction shall progress, the first mortgage bonds aforesaid, at the rate of twenty thousand dollars in amount thereof, and the sinking fund bonds aforesaid at the rate of twelve thousand dollars in amount thereof, for each mile of said railroad which shall be constructed by the said parties of the first part as aforesaid, in &quot; &quot;Report of Railroad Commissioners. and efficiency of all legislation upon this subject depend upon the enforcement of general principles of restraint rather than upon the prescription of arbitrary details, and that the most efficient super- vision that can be exercised is that where intelligent remonstrance is permitted to precede a resort to actual force. 2. Maximum preferable to specific rates. Our conclusion is partially illustrated by our own law, in so far as that law adopts maximum instead of fixed rates of fare and freight, and refers to the commissioners the propriety of modifica- tion within the limits of the law. The whole history of similar legislation demonstrates that this generalized method of restraining extortion and discrimination is more practicable and efficient, and less obnoxious than any other expedient; always presuming, how- ever, that the standard of the law is sufficiently liberal and broad for all probable contingencies. The reason of this conclusion is clear. It is impracticable for the state to assume the actual management of railroads, or to wisely determine the multitude of minor questions of policy con- stantly arising in this department of the public service. Surely there is no apology for the exercise on the part of the state of any power over corporations which can be safely and as wisely exer- cised by the corporations themselves. There is no principle of American government so thoroughly or so properly established, as that which limits the province of legislation, in all times and under all circumstances, to enactments for the general good, and which denies to government the right or the duty of unnecessary inter- ference with private or public enterprise. In railway legislation this principle is entitled to as much respect as in case of any other legislation; and the first question to be determined is, the extent to which such legislation is necessary for the protection of the peo- ple, without unjust detriment to investments in corporate enter- prises, and to individual discretion in their management. 3. It provides for correct information as the basis of future action. The circumstance of an official position, like that of the present commissioners under this law, need not excuse us from all allusion to the great importance of the most careful and deliberate action in matters of so great moment matters involving complex and extremely difficult questions of a somewhat technical and profes- &quot; &quot;Records of Railway Companies. 183 branches as aforesaid, with all the franchises and property of the said party of the first part. 5. And the said party of the second part, in consideration of the premises, hereby covenants and agrees, to and with the said party of the first part, that when the said line of railroad herein before described and leased shall be fully completed in the manner aforesaid as a first class railroad, and the same shall have been accepted by it, it will equip the said road with all the engines, locomotives, passenger, freight, platform, gravel, wood and hand and other cars, reasonably necessary to transact all the business of said road, and to transport, without unreasonable delay, ali the passenger and freight which may be offered for transportation over or upon the line of said road. 6. And that from the time the said road shall be completed as aforesaid, the said party of the second part will pay rent for the property herein leased, which rent shall be fixed at the rates and in the manner following, viz: out of the first fifteen hundred dollars per mile of gross earnings in each year, the party of the first part shall receive seven hundred dollars per mile, out of any excess of gross earnings is such year over the said fifteen hundred dol- lars per mile, until such excess shall reach three thousand dollars per mile, the said party of the first part shall receive thirty-three and one-third per cent. thereof as a further rental; and out of any excess over forty-five hun- dred dollars per mile of gross earnings in such year, the said party of the first part shall receive twenty per cent. thereof as a further rental. 7. The said party of the first part hereby covenants and agrees, that as soon as this agreement is executed and delivered by the party of the second part, it will issue and deliver to said party of the second part, for its own proper use, certificates of its capital stock equal in amount to one-half there- of, and will, in like manner, issue to said party of the second part, at any subsequent period, one-half of any further issue of its capital stock, both common and preferred, subject to such instalments as the said party of the first part may call thereon under the provisions of its charter and articles of association, not, however, in any case exceeding ten per cent. of the par value thereof; and in express consideration thereof, the said party of the sec- ond part covenants, agrees and gurantees that the minimum amount of ren- tal above specified, for each and every year shall be sufficient to pay and sat- isfy the interest which shall accrue during each and every year upon the bonds that shall be issued by the said party of the first part, in accordance with the terms of this agreement, as herein before stated. And in case the amount of rental as herein before stated, accruing to the party of the first part, under the terms of this lease, shall not be found sufficient in amount in any one year to pay the interest on said bonds for said year, then and in that event the amount of rental which said party of the second part shall pay for that year shall be the sum which is required to pay the interest on said bonds, and no more; and any deficiency so paid by the party of the second part to satisfy the interest on said bonds, shall not be a charge upon the ren- tal accruing to the party of the first part for any succeeding year. 8. An accurate account of gross earnings shall be made up at the end of each half year after the above railroad shall come into possession, and be ac- cepted by said party of the second part under this agreement, and the rent for such half year shall be payable in the manner hereafter provided; that is to say: First. In order to protect the property and franchises herein described in the possession of the party of the second part, by preventing any default in the payment of the interest upon the bonds aforesaid, the said party of the second part shall pay the interest coupons upon the bonds authorized to be issued herein as they shall severally become due, at its office or agency in the city of New York, upon presentation thereof, and such payments shall be taken as a payment upon the rental herein. Second. If, after the payment of such interest coupons as aforesaid in any such half year, any balance should be due the party of the first part, under the provisions hereof, the party of the second part shall pay to the trustee named in said mortgage the amount then due and unpaid, for that or any previous half year, upon the sinking fund specified in the mortgage which shall be given to secure the payment of said bonds, or any part thereof. &quot; &quot;2 Appendix. rights granted to the original companies by operation of law, and is entitled to exercise them. The sad spectacle is now presented of this great state at- tempting to violate its plighted faith and repudiate its solemn agreement; after the roads have been built, and the money of the stockholders expended, after the improvement has been made, and the state received all the benefits expected. I cannot believe that the people of this state desire to be placed in any such position, and am satisfied that the action of the legislature in enacting this law will be repudiated by them, as soon as its real character is understood. That it has effectually destroyed all future railroad enterprises, no one who is ac- quainted with its effect in money centers will for a moment doubt. That, however, I do not care to discuss at this time, as the state has an undoubted right to prevent a further extension of its railroad system if it chooses, al- though, as a citizen, I deeply regret such short sighted policy. But as the representative of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, a part of whose system of roads is in this state, and who have expended over $25,000,000 in permanent improvements therein, on the faith and credit of the charters granted, all of which is directly and seriously affected by the law in question, and must be ultimately ruined and destroyed, if this policy is per- sisted in and successfully enforced, I am compelled not only to protest against such unjust legislation and violation of plighted faith, but also to in- form you, and through you, the people of the state, what its effect, if submit- ted to, will be, not only upon the company that I represent, but upon the whole railroad system of the state, and the business interests of the whole community. The entire road of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Rail- way Company, as now constructed and equipped, has cost about $36,000 per mile. The portion in Wisconsin, including all our valuable grounds and im- provements at Milwaukee and other points, cost about $28,000 per mile. It is capitalized at those sums respectively, in bonds and stock. The stock has never been watered, and it is believed that the road could not be produced in its present condition for a sum less than its cost or present capitalization at this time. All agree that the company is entitled to a fair return on the cap- tal invested. The railroads already constructed have added many millions to the wealth of the state, and perhaps no class have derived so great a benefit as the far- mer. Many of the farms and much of the farming land of Wisconsin, now worth from $50 to $100 per acre, without railroads would not be worth to ex- ceed $10 to $20. Other branches of business and other industries of the state have experienced a similar benefit from the construction and operation of those roads. Yet every one familiar with railroading in Wisconsin, is aware that no dividends were paid for the first twelve or fifteen years that the roads were in operation, and that they were unable to pay the interest on their bonds, and nearly all passed through the process of foreclosure. It is only within the last ten years that any dividends have been paid on the stock of any of the roads. The bonded debt of the companies, generally, bears only 7 per cent. interest, and amounts to but little more than half the actual cost of the roads with their equipments. During the last ten years this interest has been paid and represents an income of seven per cent. on a trifle over one-half of the cost of the property. Since the organization of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, in May, 1863, there has been paid in cash dividends on its stock, which represents nearly one-half of the actual cost of the prop- erty, $3,813,257 72-100, which amounts to twenty-four per cent. only for the whole time, ten and half years, and is equivalent to a dividend of only 2 28-100 per cent. per annum on the stock of the company. All the balance of the earnings over and above these dividends and payment of the interest on the bonded debt, has been consumed, in operating expenses and improve- ments of the road and rolling stock, and bringing the property to its present state and condition, and were necessary for that purpose. We have then, as the results of the last ten and a half years existence of the Chicago, Milwau- kee and St. Paul Railway Company, one-half of the cost of the road capital- ized in bonds which has received seven per cent. per annum; the other half, capitalized in stock, preferred and common, which has received 2 28-100 per cent. per annum in cash, and taking stock and bonds together, the acutual re- turn to the investors has been 4 46-100 per cent. per annum on the actual cost &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 215 STATEMENT OF COST of Menominee Extension to June 30, 1874.

Maximum rates and fares, as well as the classification of freights, are determined with the approval of the government, but much liberty is allowed as to lowering rates and making special tariffs. Publicity of all rates is imperative and no change can be made without a month&apos;s notice. Through rates, running powers and other facilities about which there has been so much discussion in England and in this country, are provided for by law. The con- trol of railway matters is with the Central Railway Commission, of which the Minister of Public Works is president. The surveillance is very extensive and minute, being in the hands of officers who have been thoroughly trained in the great technical schools of the empire. It has been claimed that the absence of competition results in a falling behind other countries in the matter of improvements, etc., but the system certainly works smoothly and very satisfactorily in all other respects. The Republic appears to have considered it good enough to let alone. 3. The railway problem in Germany. In Germany the railway system is mixed; some roads being own- ed and managed by the state, others by chartered companies. The Prussian government started out in 1838 on the anti-compe- tition principle, enacting that no second railway running in the same direction as the first, and touching the same principal points, should be constructed by any other parties than the company con- ducting the first railway, within a period of 30 years from the open- ing of such railway-a law which proved repressive of railway en- terprise and often disadvantageous to the public. The same law reserved to the state the right to purchase any railway, for due con- sideration, within 30 years from date of opening. Under the Empire all railways in the several states confederated are to be administered as one system, which has been considerably extended in liberality as well as scope, since its inauguration. As the constitution of the empire lays down the general princi- ples of the system, we here introduce so much of that instrument as relates to railways: &quot; &quot;118 Appendix.

Transactions of this sort are usually managed with such adroitness that detection is dif- ficult, if not impossible; but the cases are neither few nor far to seek in which the evidence is convincing, that the terms conceded by purchasers must be accounted for either on the ground of dis- honesty or lack of judgment. 6. Misappropriation of land grants. The American government is the only one that has adopted the policy of making donations of the public lands of the country to aid in the construction of internal improvements looking to the in- dustrial progress of the nation. In view of the newness of the country, the deficiency of cash capital for the construction of expensive works, and the extent and variety of its material resources, which must otherwise long remain undeveloped, this policy may have appeared at the time to be a wise one. Indeed it has promoted the industrial prosperity of the nation. In the case of the trans-continental railways-the Union and the Central already in use, and the Northern and Southern now in con- struction-there was still another motive that influenced the gov- ernment to bestow the immense grants they have received. The rebellion had taught us the danger of disintegration. The Atlan- tic and Pacific states were so removed that there was danger of an early political falling apart. There was need, therefore, that these great divisions of our common country be brought into closer rela- tions. This was the argument. Unhappily, experience has shown that there is another side to this question of government aid in the construction of railways— that land-grants, how much soever needed for the encouragement of improvements in the interest of industry and commerce, have by no means been an unmixed good-that, in view of the corrup- tions engendered, and the public demoralization they have pro- duced, it is quite doubtful whether they have not been a curse rather than a benefit. A full history of the land-grants to the several states would show a sad record of broken trusts and shameful frauds upon the public. We shall attempt nothing more than a brief reference to some of the grants made to this and neighboring states, by way of illustra- ting the misappropriations to which reference has been made. &apos; &quot;110 Report of Railroad Commissioners. — - Cheap passenger trains.

Our people, by a most wise and benificent provision in their constitution, have perpetually reserved the power to the legislature to alter or repeal all charters or acts of incorporation at any time after their passage.&apos; &apos;As yet, we believe, the power has never been exercised with respect to any railroad company organized in this state, and possibly it may never be. It is valuable, however, as a check upon the rapacity which these corporations sometimes exhibit, and the time may come when the legislature will be im- periously required to exert it; but when it does, if ever, it will not be to de- prive the corporation or its stockholders of their legitimate rights, but to correct abuses and save the rights of the people. The legislature will not re- duce the tolls or rates to an unreasonably low figure, or so as to disappoint the just expectations of the owners of stock.&amp;quot; In 1874, this sounds like prophecy. And at the last term, in the unreported case of West Wis. R. Co. v. Trempeleau, supra, Mr. Justice Cole said: &amp;quot;The validity of these acts repeal- ing the exemption is mainly rested upon the power reserved to the legislature by Sec. 1, Art. XI of the constitution, which in terms declares that all gen- eral laws or special acts under which corporations without banking powers are created, may be altered or repealed by the legislature, at any time after their passage. If the proper force and effect are given to this constitional provis- ion, it would seem to afford ample authority for the enactment of the repealing statutes above cited, as it reserves the right to the legislature to amend and re- voke all corporate franchises and privileges which it might grant. In this case, the legislature first relinquised the right of taxation, so far as the lands in controversy are concerned, and then subsequently resumed it. But this the learned counsel for the company contend it was not competent for the legis- lature to do, because it impaired the obligation of a contract which the state had made. The doctrine that a state may grant or bargain away beyond reach, the right of taxation, a high political and sovreign power, essential to the very existence of the state, and without which no governmental functions can be exercised or carried on, has always seemed to me to rest on a very un- satisfactory grounds; and I am unable to assent to its general correctness. If the legislature of a state may relinquish for a specified period the right to tax the property of persons or corporations within its jurisdiction, it may do so permanently; and it may upon the same ground, relinquish its police power, the right of eminent domain and other sovereign power, until nothing of the state government remains but a name. I should greatly regret the gen- eral recognition, or even acquiesence without protest, in such a doctrine, as sound constitutional law. And thererore I feel constrained to withold my as- sent to it at this time. I do not propose to enter upon any discussion of the question, however, as it is not necessarily the ground upon which our decision in this case is founded. I concede that the supreme court of the United States say that the question, whether the legislature has the power to grant away the right of taxation is one not open to discussion in that court, because the pow- er has been affirmed by repeated adjudications made in that court; and the doctrine of Dartmouth College case has been applied in all its extent and vig- or to such a legislative grant. The object and historical origin of the provis- ion in the constitution of the state, are matters known to all professional men. They were, through this paramount authority, to retain and secure to the state full power and control over corporate franchises, rights and privileges which it might grant:-a power and control which the state was, in a manner, de- prived of by the federal constitution, as that instrument had been interpreted in the celebrated Dartmouth college case. With the grant of exemption from taxation, was annexed the reservation that such grant might be altered or re- voked by the legislature at any time after its passage. It was a qualification of the grant: and the subsequent exercise of the reserved power cannot be re- garded as an act impairing the obligation of contracts.&amp;quot; And the court sus- stained the exercise of the reserved right. This has been the unanimous opinion and decision of this court, always, in all cases before it. And, by force of the constitutional power reserved, and of the uniform construction and application of it, the rule in the Dartmouth College case is applied to corporations, never had place in this state, never was the law here. The state emancipated itself from the thraldom of that de- &quot; &quot;30 30 Appendix. and employés have, during all the time since the said 28th day of April, 1874, charged, demanded and received, and now and still do charge, demand and receive of and from persons carried on their said railroad, and of and from persons shipping goods, wares and merchandise to be carried thereon between places within this state, rates and compensation therefor, higher and greater than those fixed and authorized by the said last mentioned act of the legislature, and greater and higher than said defendant is empowered by law to ask, demand or receive. And the said attorney general further as aforesaid alleges and shows to the court, that the said defendant has ever since the said 28th day of April, 1874, used and operated its railroads within the state of Wisconsin, in direct violation of the act last above mentioned in defiance of law and contrary to the authority granted to a by law, and that it still does so use and operate its railroad, and now is daily and habitually charging and receiving greater and higher rates and compensations for the transportation of freight and passen- gers upon its said railroad within this state, than are fixed established and allowed by the said last mentioned act of the legislature, and that said rates are so charged and received by said defendant, as aforesaid for carying freight and passengers which do not come from beyond the boundaries of the state of Wisconsin, to be carried across or through the same and which do not come from plaees without the state of Wisconsin, to be carried to or de- livered at places or stations within this state, and which are not received for the carriage or transportation of freights or persons from stations or places within the state of Wisconsin, to places or stations without said state. In consideration whereof, and to the end that the said defendant may be enjoined from exceeding its powers in manner and form as above stated, and from asking, demanding or receiving rates of fare for the carriage of persons and of toll or compensation for the transportation of goods, wares and other articles received at or taken from any one station or depot within said state and carried to and delivered at any other depot or station therein, the said Attorney General, appearing and suing in the name of and on behalf of the said state, as aforesaid, prays the justices of this court to grant unto the said plaintiff the writ of injunction issuing out of and under the seal of this honorable court, to be directed to the said defendant to restrain it, its officers, agents, servants, workmen and employees from exceeding the powers hereby conferred upon the said defendant, and from violating and disregarding the laws in the manner above stated and complained of, and the said plaintiff prays judgment that the said injunction may be made perpetual by the final order of this honorable court.

Co., supra. &amp;quot;Railways are the great public highways of the world, along which its gi gantic currents of trade and travel pour-highways compared with which the most magnificent highways of antiquity dwindle into insignificance. They are the most marvelous invention of modern times. They have done more to develop the wealth and resources, to stimulate the industry, reward the labor, and promote the general comfort and prosperity of the country, than any other, and perhaps all other, mere physical causes combined. There is prob- ably not a man, woman or child, whose interest and comfort have not been in some degree subserved by them.&amp;quot; And we endorse and repeat what Chief Justice Dixon well said in the same case: &amp;quot;The power of the legislature to regulate the tolls and charges of such companies is in itself a limited one, if not in a constitutional sense, certainly in the sense of morality and justice. If there be not an express, there is cer- tainly an implied, obligation and promise, on the part of the state, never to reduce the tol&apos;s and charges below a standard which will be reasonable, or which will afford a fair and adequate_remuneration and return upon the amount of capital actual invested. This obligation and promise, which spring from the act of incorporation and invitation by the state to persons to invest their money in the stock, it is presumed that no legislative body would disregard, except where the company, by gross and wanton abuse of its priv- ileges, had forfeited its rights; and then, instead of legislative action, it is also presumed that the regular course of judicial proceedings would be pre- ferred. The true intent and object of the power is, that the legislature shall be able to protect the rights and interests of the people, but not that it should arbitrarily impair the rights and franchises of the company, or destroy the property of its stockholders. The good faith of the state is pledged against this, and it is not within the range of presumption that it will ever be done. The individuals owning the property, and whom the corporation represents, purchase it under this pledge and inducement held out by the state. To them it is a matter of mere private business, engaged in under the sanction and en- couragement of the state, and for their individual gain and emolument; and the legislature will no more unnecessarily interfere with it, or with the busi- ness of the corporations when it is legitimately and properly conducted, than it will with any other private business.&amp;quot; And, fully sustaining the reserved power and this exercise of it, as matter of law, we add to what the judges of this court have said, what Chancellor Kent says, that it should be matter for serious consideration how far the ex- ercise of the reserved power is consistent with justice and policy, and that it ought to be under the guidance of extreme moderation and discretion. 2 Kent&apos;s Com., 306. It is deeply to be regretted that there is just now more or less excitement against railroad corporations, although we believe that its extent is greatly exaggerated. But it seems to us quite safe to say that, though this feeling may be unwise, it is not vindictive; but is rather of the nature of parental anger against those spoiled children of legislation, as our statute books abundantly show them to be, who, after some quarter of a century of legislative favors lavishly showered upon them, unwisely mutiny against the first serious legis- lative restraint they have met. If it be true that the people are too angry, it is very sure that the companies have been too defiant. But, be all this as it may, there is some excitement against them. We entertain no doubt, how- ever, that through it all, the sound and just views just quoted from their chosen and trusted Judges, Dixon and Paine, are the views of the people of this state to-day; that they always have been; and that these corporations and all interested in them may safely rely on the sense of justice of the peo- ple and the legislature. The judgment of both may err. It is said that it ha erred in the details of this chapter 273. Of that we are not the judges; but we believe that it is yet to be verified by experiment. It may well be that the high rates charged by the railroads have lessened their own receipts, by crip- pling the public interests. The affidavits of experts have been read to the contrary; but they are only opinions, founded indeed on past statistics. Such opinions, founded on such statistics, would have defeated cheap postage, and are helping to-day to defeat a moderate tariff. Experience often contradicts 5—R. R.—App. &quot; &apos;Executive and Legal Documents. PROCLAMATION BY THE GOVERNOR. STATE OF WISCONSIN, EXECUTIVE OFFICE, MADISON, May 1, 1874. WHEREAS, The legislature, at its last session, passed an act entitled &quot;An act in relation to railroads, express and telegraph companies in the state of Wisconsin,&quot; classifying railroads and freights, limiting and fixing the com- pensation to be charged for the transportation of freight and passengers, and providing for the appointment of railroad commissioners; and, WHEREAS, The power of the legislature to regulate the operation of such companies in the respects named, is conceded to exist; and, WHEREAS, Said act was duly approved on the 4th day of March, A. D. 1874, and was officially published on the 28th day of April, A. D., 1874, and is now, to all intents and purposes, the law of the land; and, WHEREAS, The Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company, and the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, on the 29th day of April, A. D. 1874, filed in the Executive Department communications signed by their respective presidents, and addressed to the Governor of the State of Wiscon- sin, in which they announce their determination to operate their roads with- out reference to the provisions of said act, and in defiance of its requirements; and, WHEREAS, This unusual course on the part of these two great corporations is at once a source of profound regret, and in marked and unfavorable con- trast with the patience and submission exhibited by the people in the pres- ence of what they have deemed the unjust and burdensome exactions of the railroad companies in the past, and, if persisted in, must seriously disturb the business and greatly imperil the industries of the state; and, WHEREAS, The constitution of the state devolves upon the Executive the duty to &quot;expedite all such measures as shall be resolved upon by the legisla- ture, and to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,&quot; Now, therefore, I, William R. Taylor, governor of the state of Wisconsin, do proclaim and make known that the law of the land must be respected and obeyed. While none are so week as to be without its protection, none are so strong as to be above its restraints. If provisions of the law be deemed op- pressive, resistance to its mandates will not abate, but rather multiply the anticipated evils. It may well be that the law is defective in some of its details, but it is still the law of the land, enacted by the legislature in the exercise of its conceded powers, and in accordance with the clearly expressed sentiment of the people of the state. It is the right of all to test its validity through the constituted channels, but with that right is coupled the duty of yielding a general obedience to its requirements until it has been pronounced invalid by competent authority. I am not without hope that better counsels will yet prevail with the railroad companies of the state; but if they or any of them are fixed in the determination to pursue the policy announced, upon them will fall the penalties of the law, and the consequences of a severe popular con- demnation. I, therefore, enjoin all railroad corporations, their officers and agents, peaceably to submit to the law, for since the Executive is charged with the responsibility of seeing that the laws are faithfully executed, all the functions of his office will be exercised to that end; and for this purpose he invokes the aid and cooperation of all good citizens. In testimony whereof I have hereunto subscribed my name and caused the great seal of the state to be hereto affixed. Done at the capital in the city of Madison, this first day of May, in the year of our Lord, 1874. By the Governor: PETER DOYLE, WM. R.

The opinion has been very often expressed to your commissioners during their travels over the state, that unfair discriminations have been a more prolific source than any other of the dissatisfied feel- ing recently shown by the people of many sections-a fact in itself constituting a reason for a prompt correction of this evil. The principle that should govern in the matter of making dis- criminations will be discussed further on. INEFFICIENCY OF MANAGEMENT. Another evil of practical railway management, and a crying one in this country, is inefficiency. No one who has traveled exten- sively upon European railways, can have failed to note that a cer- tain slackness is too common with us in every department of the service. Section hands are not thorough enough in looking over every foot of the track. Switch-tenders, who should be as vigilant as a sentinel in face of the foe, are not sufficiently mindful of how truly they hold in their hands the issues of life and death. The inspector of engines either has no existence, or takes far too much upon trust. The car-inspector is not sufficiently quick to detect a flaw in wheel or axle, or a fault in gear of truck. The freight agent is gruff and slow about the shipping and delivery of freight. The ticket agent is inattentive to the questions of the foreign or inexperienced traveler, and sends him by the wrong route. The baggage men are reckless and smash up the baggage, to save them- selves the trouble of careful handling. The engineer, however careful of the engine itself, so manages it, in switching, and taking up and cutting off the coaches belonging to his train as to bang up the rolling stock and knock passengers off their feet, and even off their seats. The conductor runs his train with a provoking un- punctuality. And finally, the system of book-keeping is rarely such that the general agent, the chief engineer, the superintendent, or the general manager can report, under three months time, the exact amount and kind of business done, the cost to the company of operating any one division of its road, or the average cost per passenger or ton of freight per mile, or the cost per train-mile. Scarcely anything is done with that scrupulous precision, efficiency &quot; &quot;Laws Relating to Railroads. 297 tained a lien upon all the property of the road. Other sections of the act simply extended the power of the company to carry out in good faith the enterprise it had undertaken. Act approved October 11, 1856. Chap. 517, Laws of 1856, authorized the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company to consolidate its capital stock with the Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad Company, upon terms to be agreed upon; the La Crosse Company to retain its corporate name in the newly consolidated company. All corpo. rate rights, powers and franchises of the Milwaukee and Watertown Com. pany were declared to be merged in the consolidated company whenever the act was consummated.

Chap. 314, laws of 1857, amends the charter of said railroad, by fixing a new time for holding its annual election of directors, and further, as to the manner of making awards for lands, etc., taken in the construction of the road.

Chap. 121, Laws of 1858, provides in detail new regulations for the election of directors, who are limited to nine persons, with stringent penalties for any violation of the provisions of the act.

Chap. 233, laws of 1861, repeals so much of the grant of land made to the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railway Company as it would have been entitled to if built between Madison and Portage City, and confers said lands upon the Sugar River Valley Railroad Company upon certain and specific condi- tions. Act approved April 12, 1861. Chap. 87, Laws of 1862, amends the charter of the La Crosse and Milwau- kee Railroad, by providing that in all proceedings of commissioners to make appraisement of the value of lands taken by the company, it shall be lawful, in making their award, to take into consideration the damages of the party whose land was taken, as well as the value of the land taken; and that on trial of all appeals, recovery might be had for damages as well as the actual value of the land. Act approved April 7, 1862. Chap. 243, Laws of 1863, repeals so much of the grant of land made to the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, as lies between Tomah and Lake St. Croix, and confers the same upon the Tomah and Lake St. Croix Railroad Company, which the act charters. Act approved April 1, 1863. Chap. 224, laws of 1864, created a sinking fund in aid of the farm mort gagors of the state, by requiring the company or organization who may now or hereafter occupy or operate the railroad, or any part thereof, hereto- fore built and constructed as one continuous line from Milwaukee to La Crosse, to pay annually to the state treasurer twelve per cent. of the gross earnings of the road, to be applied to the payment of the interest and prin- cipal of said mortgages until fully discharged.

Chap. 238, laws of 1852, incorporates the Southern Wisconsin Railroad &quot; &quot;62 Report of Railroad Commissoners. on the very favorable terms on which it was purchased, and there the matter ends. 2. The &amp;quot;watering&amp;quot; of stock. But the giant evil under the head of dishonest management, is undue inflation of stock. A fraudulent contract, the building and buying in of roads to be foisted upon the company managed, as well as the building up and killing out of cities and villages, usually require time, skill in manoeuvering, and careful conceal- ment of the operator&apos;s hand. Not so with stock-watering. Here the cardinal qualities are daring, and deafness to the protestations of justice. The law is silent, and up to a crtain limit the public must have transportation, no matter what the cost. This practice is probably confined to no one country, but it is doubtful, perhaps, whether any other railway managers in the world have a genius for it equal to the American. For illustration of the magnificent scale on which it is sometimes conducted, we have but to look at a single through line from Chicago to New York-the line formed by the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern, the New York Central and Hudson River Railways-whose total waterings, within the past few years are alleged to exceed in amount $80,000,000. The interest on this sum, at 8 per cent., is $6,400,000. And since the tariffs on these several roads are gauged to yield that per cent. on nominal capital, it is manifest that this one through line of railways is annually laying this enormous tax of over $6,000,000 upon the earnings of those who support it, in order that the holders of the stock may reap an annual dividend of some 16 per cent. on the real cost. If this be the tribute paid by the west on one line of railway with a mileage less than one-seventieth of that of the United States, what must be the burden imposed by this cause upon the industry of the whole country? UNSKILFUL MANAGEMENT. Not a little of the poverty of which some railway companies complain, and not a little of the ill feeling here and there manifest- ed toward them, is due to a want of skill and good judgment in conducting their practical affairs. In too many instances they ap- pear to act on the theory that the railway company is alike superior to the will of the state, and independent of popular favor; and &quot; &apos;Railway Statistics. 93 and under the same order of the court, the eastern division of the La Crosse and Milwaukee road-from Milwaukee to Portage City-was placed in the possession of the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company, for the purpose of main- taining, in behalf of the public, a continuous railroad over the whole origi- nal line of road from La Crosse to Milwaukee. Under the direction of the court, the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company was required to operate the east- ern division for the benefit of the creditors of that division, and to pay over to the receiver monthly all earnings from that portion of the line, except the cost of operation and necessary repairs. At this time, persons interested in the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company owned or controlled lands included in the mortgage to claimants against the eastern division to the amount of $478,000, being nearly one-half the whole amount of the mortgage on that division. Dec. 31, 1865 the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company reported that it held prior liens against the eastern division of the La Crosse and Milwau- kee road, as follows: balance on &quot;land grant mortgage;&quot; $1,445,321, other claims, $758,187.14; interest due, $432,584.72. Total, $2,636,092.86-about $27,750 per mile. The directors claimed that these liens far exceeded the value of the property. During the ensuing year-1866—the eastern division was foreclosed in the United States district court. The Milwaukee and St. Paul company, and all its assets, was represented January 1, 1866, by a cost set forth by the president and directors as follows: Real estate-depot grounds, $150,000; first mortgage bonds, $4,600,000; second mortgage bonds, $1,500,000; preferred stock, $2,400,000; common stock, $1,000,000. The total length of road was then 275 miles, including western division of La Crosse and Milwaukee, 105 miles; Milwaukee to Portage City via Watertown, 91; Horicon to Berlin and Omro, 53 miles; Watertown to Sun Praire, 26 miles; and the sum of cost, above stated, was $9,650,000-or 35,000 per mile. &quot;&quot; May 1, 1866, an arrangement was agreed upon between the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company and the Milwaukee and Prairie du Chien Company, whereby the earnings of the two roads were “stocked&quot; in proportion to the length of their respective lines. Subsequently, the same year, an arrange- ment was perfected by which a majority of the Prairie du Chien stock was transferred to the trustees of the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company, in exchange for the the stock of the latter company, on terms mutually beneficial and satisfactory.&quot; At the annual election of the directors of the Prairie du Chien Company the Milwaukee and St. Paul Company voted about two-thirds of the stock represented, and thus practically absorbed the whole line of the former company, with its Iowa connections, including the McGregor Western and the Minnesota Central. The former line was in operation from McGregor to Cresco, 66 miles, and the latter from Minne- apolis to Owatonna, 71 miles. The road from Cresco to Owatonna, about 90 miles, necessary to complete a continuous line from Milwaukee to Minne- apolis, was under contract, and the contrctors were to receive for the work $2,000,000 in mortgage bonds upon the line to be constructed, and $1,000,000 in the stock of the Milwaukee and St. Paul company-one-half preferred &apos; &quot;Laws Relating to Railroads. 319 Chap. 297, Laws of 1865, authorizes said company to extend its road northerly from Mineral Point to Tomah, and to increase its capital stock to an amount not exceeding $1,500,000. Chap. 327, Laws of 1868, authorizes the village of Dodgeville to loan its credit in the sum of $18,000, to aid in the extension of said railroad from Mineral Point to Dodgeville, in the usual manner of such loans, and to con- tract with the Mineral Point or other railroad company in reference thereto. Act approved March 5, 1868. Chap. 257, Laws of 1873, authorizes the Governor to appoint a com- missioner to make a full and thorough investigation whether the present owners of said railroad are so using its franchises and powers as to be extortionate, unaccomodating and oppressive upon the people of Iowa and other counties, and patrons generally of the road. On completion of the testimony said commissioner was required to report the facts to the governor, to be laid before the legislature. Act approved March 19, 1873. See Appendix. ST. CROIX AND SUPERIOR R. R. CO.

Land grants have been made by congress to the state of Wisconsin to aid in the construction of railroads, as follows: By the act of June 3, 1856,* every alternate section of land designated by odd numbers, for six miles in width on each side of railroads located from Madison, or Columbus, by the way of Portage City to the St. Croix River or Lake, between townships 25 and 31, and from thence to the west end of Lake Superior, and to Bayfield. And from Fond du Lac, on Lake Winnebago, northerly to the state line. By an act of congress, May 5, 1864,* the grant on the first described route was increased to every alternate odd numbered section for ten miles on each side of the road. By the act of May 5, 1864,* there was also granted every alternate odd num- bered section for ten miles on each side of a railroad located from Portage City, Berlin, Doty&apos;s Island or Fond du Lac, as the state might determine, in a northwestern direction to Bayfield, and thence to Superior, on Lake Superior. Also, by joint resolution, April 25, 1862,* 80 acres of the Fort Howard Military Reserve, in Brown county. The total number of acres of land estimated to have been included in these several grants was estimated, in 1868, by the General Land Office, to amount to 5,378,360.50, which was reduced, by report of 1872, to 3,758,436.07. The grants were disposed of by the state as follows: LA CROSSE AND MILWAUKEE RAILROAD COMPANY. The lands which were granted to aid in the construction of a railroad from Madison to Columbus by the way of Portage City to the St. Croix river or lake between townships 25 and 31, and from thence to the west end of lake Superior, and to Bayfield, were conferred upon the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, by act of the legislature, approved October 11, 1856. Ch. 122, G. L. 1856. ST. CROIX AND LAKE SUPERIOR RAILROAD COMPANY. Subsequently, the lands thus conferred upon the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, were divided as follows: From St. Croix to the west end of Lake Superior, and to Bayfield. By an act of the legislature, ap- proved March 5, 1857, the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company were authorized to convey to the St. Croix and Lake Superior Railroad Company their interest to that portion of the grant applicable to so much of the route as extends from St. Croix lake or river to the west end of lake Superior, and to Bayfield. Chap. 230, P. L. 1857. * See Appendix. &quot; &quot;82 Appendix. way companies may charge and receive for carrying persons and property in this state. This case raises the question of the validity, in a certain contingency, of specific provisions of the act. Premising that the railways of the defendant company and of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company are in- cluded in Class A, and the car loads of lumber in controversey in Class G, the provisions of the act applicable to the case are as follows: No individual, company, or corporation, owning, operating, managing or leasing any rail- road or part of a railroad designated in section one as class A or B, shall charge for or receive a greater or higher rate for carrying articles named in the several special classes herein designated than is hereinafter provided, namely, Class G, not exceeding eight dollars, per car load for the first twenty-five miles, and not exceeding two dollars per car load for each additional twenty-five miles or fractional part thereof, unless the fraction be less than thirteen miles, in which case the rate shall not exceed one and one-half dollars per car load for such fractional part. In computing the rates for carrying any freights ac- cording to the provisions of this act, the distance for carrying such freights shall be computed from where it is received, notwithstanding it may pass from one railroad to another. (Sections 4 and 5.) * * * * * * * Under the foregoing provisions, it is apparent that the maximum rate for carrying the lumber or the plaintiff from Oshkosh to Oconomowoc, is the same as it would have been, had the carriage terminated at Watertown Junc- tion. From this fact it is contended on behalf of the defendant company, that the act seeks to compel it to transport the lumber from Watertown Junction to Oconomowoc without compensation, and it is agreed that such an enactment is not a valid exercise of legislative power. We do not so understand the act. It is true that had the lumber been consigned to Watertown Junction, the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad Company would have been entitled un- der the act to demand and recover fifteen dollars per car load for the carriage thereof. But the lumber was consigned to Oconomowoc, and that company received it so consigned. It received the same with full knowledge that the maxi- mum legal rates for the whole carriage was fifteen dollars per car load, and that the defendant company was to perform a portion of the service. We are aware of no statute which assumes to give the whole freight to one company and thus compel the other to render services without compensation. We are of opinion that fifteen dollars per car load is the highest rate of freight that can lawfully be demanded for the whole carriage, and that the same should be divided between the two railway companies, on some equita- ble principal to be determined by the courts in case the companies invoke the aid of the courts in the premises. Because the act does not require the defendant to transport the plaintff&apos;s lumber without compensation, we are relieved from the duty of deciding what the effect would be, did the act so require. The plaintiffs having tendered to the defendant the full amount of freight which the statute permits to be charged, were entitled to the lumber, and the judgment of the circuit court awarding to them the possession thereof, is and must be approved. &quot; &quot;22 Report of Railroad Commissioners. One of the most notable facts brought out by these inquiries, is the great difference in the reported cost and estimated value of the roads, as compared with official statements when portions of them were in course of construction. [See especially pages 78-82, 101 and 227.] Another is the marked difference in the present cash valua- tion and cost of the roads as reported by the companies; the range being from $19,121 to $62,308 per mile. Between the average cost per mile of the Chicago and North- western proper and the valuation of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul-roads not very unequal in apparent cost-the difference amounts to $19,267 per mile; a little more than the total reported cost per mile of the Green Bay and Minnesota Railroad. While there is good reason to believe that the cost of our roads has, with but few exceptions, been greater than it ought to have been, it is no more than just that it be pointed out as a fact that, in respect of reported cost, we have not outdone the other states, nor very nearly approached the average for the whole United States, which is lower than that of any other country in the world. except Greece and Turkey.

The reports of the companies owning lines both inside and out- side the state generally fail to give separate statistics as to that portion of their lines inside the state, except as to gross earnings.

And your petitioner further shows upon information and belief that the clasification of said railroad, and freights, and the rates of compensation for the transportation of freight and passengers upon said roads, as fixed and established by said chapter 273 are just and reasonable and within the proper exercise of the legislative power. And your petitioner further shows, that the said Chicago &amp;amp; Northwestern Railway Company, on the 29th day of April, 1874, filed in the office of the governor of the state of Wisconsin a communication, in writing, signed by the president, Albert Keep, in which, among other things, it announced that compliance with said act would be ruinous to said company, and intimated its purpose to disregard the provisions of said chapter 273 so far as the same attempts to fix rates of compensation for freights and passengers, and to man- age and operate its railroads within the state of Wisconsin without regard to its requirements. And your petitioner further shows, on information and belief, that the said Chicago &amp;amp; Northwestern Railway Company has adopted and issued a tariff of rates for freight between local stations on their road within the state, and a tariff of rates for freight and passengers transported over its road within said state of Wisconsin, and a classification of freight; all of which are in disregard of the rates and classifications fixed by said chapter 273, and con- trary to the requirements of said chapter. That said railroad company has also issued to their agents and servants in- structions to charge, demand and receive of all persons passing over their road, or shipping freight thereon, the rates and compensation set forth and adopted in the several tariffs and schedules so issued by said company. And your petitioner further shows, that the classification, rates and compen- sation so adopted by said company, are different and higher and greater than those fixed and authorized by said chapter 273, and are in no respect in con- formity therewith, but are unjust, unreasonable and oppressive. And your petitioner further shows, on information and belief, and so charges the iact to be, that the said Chicago &amp;amp; Northwestern Railway Com- pany has, ever since the 29th day of April, 1874, used and operated its said road within the state of Wisconsin in entire disregard of the provisions of said chapter 273, and is daily and habitually charging and receiving greater and higher rates of compensation for the transportation of freight and passen- gers upon their said road within this state than are fixed, established and al- lowed by said chapter 273, and that said rates and compensation are so charged and received by said railroad company as aforesaid for carrying freights which does not come from beyond the boundaries of the state, and to be carried across or through the same. And your petitioner further shows that on the ninth day of May, 1874, the said Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company charged and received of E. B. Dean, of the city of Madison, the sum of one dollar and five cents for a ticket over its road from Madison to Merrimac in the state of Wisconsin, the distance being twenty-six miles, and on the same day charged and re- ceived of the said Dean the sum of $1.05 for carrying him over their road from Merrimac to Madison, aforesaid, which said sums were higher and greater than the sum and rate fixed for said service by said chapter 273, and were unreasonable and extortionate. And your petitioner further shows that on the eighth day of May, 1874, the said railway company charged and received of Andrew R. Mosher, of the city of Madison, the sum of one dollar and ninety cents for a ticket over its road from Madison to Beloit in the state of Wisconsin; that the distance between said places is forty-seven miles; that said Mosher applied to the agent of said company at Madison to check his trunk to Beloit, and that said agent refused until he purchased a ticket, and that on applying for such ticket the said sum of $1.90 was demanded and received by said agent, and that said Mosher paid the same under protest; that said sum so charged and received was a greater and higher sum than that fixed and allowed by said chapter 273, and was unreasonable and extortionate, and that the refusal of said company to check his baggage was unjust and unreasonable, and was &quot; &quot;Railway Statistics. 145 Passengers per mile.

Of this total road, the Chicago &amp;amp; Northwestern proper included 1,498.70 miles. The remaining 491.18 miles controlled by the company were classed as “proprietary roads,” and embraced the Iowa Midland Railway, 68.80 miles; the La Crosse, Trem- pealeau &amp;amp; Prescott Railroad, 29 miles; the Winona &amp;amp; St. Peter Railroad (with Mankato branch), 330.75 miles, and the Northwestern Union Railway, 62.63 miles. The earnings and expenses of these &amp;quot;proprietary roads&amp;quot; are not included in the reports of earnings and expenses of the Chicago &amp;amp; North- western Company proper. Territorially, the whole road owned and con- trolled by the company is divided as follows: In Wisconsin, 565.68 miles; in Illinois, 489.00 miles; in Iowa, 433.90 miles; in Michigan, 170.55 miles; in Minnesota, 292.25 miles, and in Dakota, 38.50 miles. The average length of entire road operated during the year ending May 31, 1874, was 1, 952.05 miles, of which the Chicago &amp;amp; Northwestern proper operated 1,489.10 miles, and the proprietary companies 462.95 miles. The gross earnings of entire line for the same year was $15,631,936.61, and the charges for operating expenses, taxes, rent of leased roads, interest on bonds and sinking fund account, amounted to $14,276,855.26-leaving a net profit of $1,355,081.35. The aggregate earnings of the year were derived as follows: From the Chicago and Northwestern lines proper, $14,351,523.33; Iowa Midland, $98,023.38; Northwestern Union, $165,049.07; La Crosse, Trempealeau, and Prescott, $222,520.48; Winona and St. Peter, and Mankato branch, $794,820.35. The gross earnings of the Chicago and Northwestern proper were derived from the following sources: Passengers, $3,426,824.35; freight, $10,270,518.95; express, $264,583.32; mail, $266,568.08; miscellaneous, $123,028.63. The gross charges upon the Chicago and Northwestern proper, for the year, were as follows: For operating expenses, $8,883,720.03; taxes, $387,054.88; losses, Chicago fire, 1871, $5,074.75, making a total of $9,275,849.66, or 64.21 per cent. of gross earnings, and leaving a balance of $5,075,673.67. This balance, to the amount of $3,163,920.69 was expended as follows: Interest on bonds, $1,869,747.36; interest, exchange and gold premiums, $201,939.18; rentals of Iowa roads, $1,049,649.31; sinking funds, $42,120; dividends in adjustment of old Galena and Chicago Union stock, $464.84. A further sum was paid to the proprietary roads for expenses, interest, etc., during the year, amounting to $556,671.63, leaving a net profit to the company on all accounts, as before stated, for the year, of $1,355,081.35. Adding to this the balance of income account of the combined roads May 31, 1873, of $764,264.91, and the surplus of income account May 31, 1874, amounted to $2,119,346.26. All the net earnings were applied towards the payment of constructive indebtedness, &apos;mostly incurred before the panic, and &amp;quot;to finish up and utilize the works then nearly completed.&amp;quot; The capital of the Chicago and Northwestern, on the 31st of May, 1874, consisted of $14,993,060.40, in common stock, and $21,484,113.4% in preferred stock, making a total of $36,477,173.82. The bonded debt of the Chicago and Northwestern company proper at the same &quot; &apos;Remedial Measures. 127 make a railroad company an oligarchy or an autocracy, in which the auto- crat does pretty much what he pleases without thinking of asking the leave of the people who own the property with which he disposes so freely, it being assumed that he knows best what is for their interest and that he will do it, and that somehow the company would be in danger of dire disaster if the executive should have to state his plans frankly, or could not effect some great stroke of policy secretly. But time shows that, whether or no, much may be gained by a secret policy, very much may be lost by it, and the share- holders who insist on knowing what their directors are doing and intend to do, are those who lose least and gain most. Moreover, the rage for making secret combinations seems to have abated, and the public complaints against the railroads are making it necessary to publish instead of concealing the details of railroad business, and the results of the operations from year to year. There is no such friend of prejudice as ignorance, and the policy which will make it easy for shareholders and the public to understand just what the companies are doing will do most to avert the violent, unreason- able and harmful prejudice which is now widespread.&quot; The facts which are stated and the policy which is illustrated in the foregoing article, may serve to indicate a phase in the relations railroads may sustain to the community, and which would per- haps have a large influence in solving the problem of general regu- lation. It is evident that the power which the stockholder exerts over the management of a corporation when exercising his full rights, is of such a nature as to popularize as it were the business of the company. Its entire condition becomes known, alterations of its status are discussed in advance, there being no concealment, the public awards it the right to adequate returns, and economical man- agement is the enforced rule. Under such conditions necessity for state control may be said to be reduced to its minimum, and the road to have reached its normal condition in reference to the com- munity. This state of things may be said to be unknown, or at most, ex- ceptional in this country. The policy of secrecy is maintained. The few reports which are made are considered unreliable,— &quot;cooked,&quot; for a purpose, and at most appear but annually. The real condition of the road, if known at all, is known only to the man- agers, and instead of courting the confidence of the public, the en- tire management is calculated to create distrust and excite sus- picion. A move in the right direction and akin to the English practice which has now obtained, was made by the stockholders of the Pen- &apos; &quot;Evils of Railway Construction and Management. 57 In the act conferring lands upon the Illinois Central Railroad Company, the state of Illinois made an honorable exception to the general rule; requiring, as a condition of receiving the grant, that the company should annually pay into the public treasury seven per cent. of its gross earnings, a sum now amounting, we believe to something over three-quarters of a million of dollars. So far as we know, this act of a provident legislature stands conspicuous as being the only instance in which the interests of the public, in grants made to the states to aid in the construction of railways, have been carefully protected. The lands granted to Iowa and Minnesota, as well as to Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska, have been given to the roads in those states without other condition than the construction of the roads within a given date. The result has been, that the company managers have, in many cases, so planned the disposal of them as to promote their own personal, rather than public ends. In some instances, where it was possible to raise the funds for construction without making the lands the basis of securities, the roads have been built at a heavy sacrifice in the way of discounts-to be subsequently paid by the industry of the country—and the lands have been wholly or almost entirely appropriated to the private use of the builders. So far as we have learned, the lands granted to Iowa have only in a small degree lessened to the public the cost of the roads in aid of whose construction they were given. The people of Minnesota have hardly been more fortunate. That state received grants of land to aid in the construction of railroads, immediately connected with onr own, amounting to some 8,465,500 acres, disposed of as follows:* NAMES OF COMPANIES.

Their roads are well constructed, and their work- ing is efficient, and apparently satisfactory to the public. 6. Spanish and Portuguese railways. · As might have been anticipated, Spain and Portugal are imi- tators of France rather than Germany. All their roads are owned and managed by companies. They show good engineering, but are managed with less efficiency than those of France. The rail- way problem has not as yet very much agitated either government or people, so far as we have been able to learn. 7. The Belgian system. The railway history of Belgium is one of peculiar interest. From the beginning of their construction until 1850, the building and extension of the lines was pretty much monopolized by the state; at least to such an extent that, in that year, the proportion of mile- age belonging to the state was 64 per cent. of the whole; the remaining 36 per cent. being in the hands of corporations. Moreover, during this period the government had occupied the most important routes. Feeling secure, therefore, in its supremacy, it practiced more liberality, granting concessions for the building of very short lines quite freely; so that in 1860 the scale had turned, the proportion of state railways mileage then being but 33 per cent. The concessions to companies are for 90 years, and in most cases contain a reservation of power to purchase on about the same terms as is provided in the French concessions already explained, with the addition, by the government, of a premium of 15 per cent. It is rarely that pecuniary aid in the way of guaranteeing interest on bonds, or in any other form, has been granted to com- panies by the state. The principle of legislation has been to have the companies en- tirely free as to earnings within the powers allowed, there being no limitation of dividends or provision for a reduction of the maximum rates prescribed in the forms of the concession. The reliance of the state has been simply on its own skillful man- agement of the great trunk lines of which it was the owner. And so long as the other lines were short and weak, there was little em- barassment from any quarter. After 1860, however, some of the lesser companies owning lines susceptible of advantageous consoli- &quot; &apos;Remedial Measures. 131 nishing some sort of substantial basis, render it possible to nego- tiate the bonds of the company, when really issued, at a much less sacrifice than would be otherwise practicable. (2.) Prohibiting the borrowing of money on mortgage or bond, the lease or purchase of lines of railway, or the guaranteeing of the bonds of other companies, or of the interest therein, without au- thority, by a vote of stockholders at a general meeting, and the filing a notice of the intent so to do, and the reasons therefor, with the railroad commissioners. 3. One of the greatest mistakes which has been made, is that per- missive legislation which fixes no limit to the increase of either stock or bonds, the &quot;non-interference&quot; principle being here car- ried out to the bounds of absurdity, and in the wrong direction. If the original mechanism is wrong, if the component parts of the leg- islative machinery are out of order, no amount of subsequent &quot;tinkering&quot; at details will suffice to enable it to produce satisfac- tory results. An inconsistency is apparent in undertaking to legis- late charges down, when the assumed cost upon which these charges are based, and upon which it is conceded an adequate inter- est shall be paid, has by legislative permission been augmented to a point which renders it impossible to meet the imposed duty and at the same time pay the expected interest when a legislative carte blanche has been granted to increase the amount which shall be assumed as interest-paying capital, to any optional extent, and at the same time a legislative limit to the capacity to produce inter- est is established. - There is no one phase of railway management in this country which presents so many obstacles in the way of establishing proper relations between railroad corporations and the public, as this one of assumed cost. It is the pivot upon which has turned most of the special legislation to control charges, and to which also, in a great measure, their failure may be attributed. There is reason to believe, however, that the abuse of privileges in this respect have been carried so far as to react under certain con- ditions against some of those companies who have indulged in them. In illustration we quote as follows from a late address of the President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company: &quot;It is very fortunate, at a period when the evil results are shown of finan cial error, when many other railways, under the efforts of speculators and manipulators of stocks, committed the huge mistake of making not the &apos; &quot;136 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

This was merely assuming an alias dictus, not changing the body nor wholly changing its name. It had been called by one name and chose to be called by another, very similar; differing only by the addition of one word, as a sort of prænomen. These facts are pleaded on both sides. The information avers that there had been no other corporation of the name used in the chapter, and the answer cannot be held to deny it, though there is a qualified general denial. Sexton v. Rhames, 13 Wis., 99; Allis v. Sabine, 17 id., 626. Indeed we think that there is a presumption that there is no other corporation of the name. We have, therefore, little difficulty in holding that the corporation named in the act is the defendant. It is said that we cannot resort to evidence aliunde to ascertain the corporation intend- ed by the act. Probably not, but we do not need any. We can, however, look into the laws of the state to solve the question. In another case of mis- nomer of a corporation, this court held, &quot;that the objections to the act are too technical and evasive. Legislative enactments are not to be defeated on account of mistakes, errors or omissions, any more than other writings, pro- vided the intention of the legislature can be ascertained from the whole act.&quot; The court might well have added, but that it was not there necessary, that it could equally look into other acts in pari materia, as the rule is. Nazro v. Merchants M. Ins. Co., 14 Wis., 295. This act, by the name it uses, intended some corporation: there is no other but this, and this had lately been desig- nated by the name used. And we find for years before, acts granting powers to the Milwaukee &amp;amp; St. Paul Railway Company claimed here in its answer by this defendant. We find a grant of power to it, passed at the same session, and approved by the same governor, March 10, the day before chapter 273. We find no trace in the statutes of any other corporation by either of the alias dicti of this defendant. We should assuredly hold it entitled to the grant of March 10, and we will hold it subject to the act of March 11. We should be ashamed to sit here and suffer the law to fail, where the design of the legisla- ture is so apparent, through so mere a verbal quibble on so mere a verbal ac- cident. In re Croke, 1 Cowper, 29, cited by the defendant, goes upon a confusion of things, not of names; one pesignating, as Lord Mansfield says, the corpo- ration at large; the other, a select body. And in People v. Oakland Co. Bank, 1 Douglass, 282. also cited, the names of the corporation chartered and of the corporation repealed were so essentially different, that the court could not gather the legislative intention. The court say: &quot;It is not intended to assert that there should be an exact correspondence between the act creating and the one repealing a corporate charter, so far as the name of the corporation is concerned. All that is required is, that the repealing act should indicate with sufficient clearness the name of the corporation intended. There should be such a correspondence as to leave no doubt of the intention of the legis lature.&quot; There is surely such a correspondence here. We imply no censure on any of the distinguished counsel who argued these motions with so much professional ability. We allude to the defend- ants when we say, that we are constrained to regard some of these points last considered, as unworthy of these causes. And, while we are not dis- posed to censure them for litigating the main questions involved, these_petty points could not fail to remind us of the pungent criticism of Lord Lang. dale, in Brown v. Monmouth R. &amp;amp; C. Co., on such technical points introduced by other great corporations into other great litigations. IV. A question was made on the argument of the effect of the constitu- tional amendment of 1871 upon Sec. 1, Art. XI, of the Constitution. The provision of the constitution, as first framed, is that corporations might be formed under general laws, but not by special acts, except in cases where the legislature should judge that the objects could not be attained by general laws; and that such general laws or special acts might be altered or repealed at any time. Of the first clause of this section it was said: &quot;It seems very obvious, on the face of the provision, that it aimed at the evils of special legislation. The provision is against creating corporations by special acts.&quot; It is doubtful, also, whether this clause can, at best, be regarded as anything more 66 &apos; &apos;144 Report of Railroad Commissioners.

Should the company be denied the right of any increased value of those materials in the market, or be exempt from the burdens justly consequent upon their depreciation? This question should have careful consideration. To deal with railroad property upon the basis of actual cost, fur- thermore, involves a solution of the question, whether losses, dis- counts, donations, purchases on foreclosure, and kindred facts in railway management and transfer, are to be included in the calcu- lation? It is the unquestioned fact, as to all ordinary business transactions, that an unavoidable sacrifice on securities is to be accounted as a portion of actual cost, and so entered upon capital account. But this rule cannot be equitably and safely adopted by the state, in any determination of the relation of the public to rail- ways. In the construction of the Milwaukee and Prairie du Chien road, about one-third of the entire resources of the original com- pany were sacrificed during the progress of the work. It is not to be presumed that the legislature intended that this and similar sacrifices should be included in any estimate of actual cost. And yet a large proportion of the original expenditure and capital of nearly all railroad companies consists of similar elements, so intricately concerned in the expense of construction, equipment and improvement, as to defy all attempts at elimination. Nor by the railway method of computing cost.-The practice of the railway companies themselves is to add total debt to total capital stock, the sum representing total cost. The state cannot be expected to adopt this simple rule, for the reason that the exer- cise of the power of the state as to investment and earnings implies a question as to every statement of cost thus ascertained, and for the still better reason that it affords us no reliable measure of value. Nor on basis of market value of stock and bonds.-An esti- mate based wholly upon the market value of stock and bonds is equally unreliable and fallacious. A value thus indicated is con- stantly fluctuating, and depends less upon the amount invested than upon the condition of the money market, the spirit of specula- tion, and incidental circumstances bearing no direct relation to the actual cost and value of the visible property. Value determined by appraisal.—These considerations point to &quot; &apos;Laws Relating to Railroads. 301 Chap. 152, Laws of 1854, authorizes the city of Fond du Lac to loan its credit in aid of said railroad company to an amount not exceeding $200, 000, upon the usual terms and conditions common to such cases. Act approved March 16, 1854. Chap. 280, Laws of 1856, amends the charter of the Milwaukee, Fond du Lac and Green Bay Railroad Company, united by consolidation with the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company, by striking out &quot;West Bend.&quot; as a point on its route, and inserting &quot;Schleisingerville&quot; in place thereof.

Said change not to affect or in any wise impair any mortgages already given to the Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad Company during its existence.

It is not improbable that we shall desire your opinion, in due time, at length, as to the comparative operation of the present law on long lines of road. You say you have been nine years trying to perfect a classification that would harmonize with other roads. Probably you are already aware that the commissioners appreciate your labors in this direction, from the fact that they have adopted, for the present, the results of your experience. The difficulties you have encountered in this particular, very naturally sug- gest the question whether disrepancies of this class could not be more effi- ciently harmonized by means of some general regulations, imposed under the authority of the state, than by individual effort in behalf of railroads. At the proper time we shall probably submit to you some questions of a formal character upon these and other points, and simply refer to the matter now in- dividually, so that your opportunity for a full consideration of the whole sub- ject may not be limited as to time.

WISCONSIN VALLEY RALROAD, TOMAH, WIS., May 12, 1874. To the Honorable Board of Railway Commissioners of the State of Wisconsin: Herewith I send you local passenger and freight tariffs in use on the Wis- consin Valley Railway. Classification of articles you will find on freight tar- iff. The road has been running to the crossing of the Wisconsin Central Railway, 14 miles above Centralia, since December 20, 1873, on same freight tariff as charged to Centralia, excepting on lumber, which has been one dollar per car higher, or $15.00 per car of 10 tons. Central crossing to Tomah, dis- tance 60 miles, lumber, lath and shingles have been carried at same price per car load. The road is being extended, and will be running to Knowlton, 70 miles from Tomah, about June 1, 1874, when new tariffs will be isued, and your body will be furnished with copies thereof. Our passenger tariff from 16th of June, 1873, to 28th of April, 1874, was 5 cents per mile. You will observe at the latter date we changed to comply with the law. Yours respectfully, F. O. WYATT. &quot; &quot;70 Report of Railroad Commissioners. and under the decision of our Supreme Court can undoubtedly recover, and&apos; as we read the penalties for violation of the law, the company are liable for three times the amount received in excess of the rates prescribed by the Pot- ter Law.

It does not appear that the Com- missioners have fixed any rates or classified any articles of freight. And for violations of the rates fixed by the act itself, no penalties are provided against the corporations; certain civil remedies are given, but no penalty. There are penalties against agents, but the remedy against the corporations is a distinct thing from the liability of their servants, as individuals, for violation of pub- lic law mandatory upon them as private citizens. This is, perhaps, as appropriate a place as we may find to notice an objec- tion taken to the informations. It is said that they aver no specific injury to the public. Such an injury, in such a case, is a conclusion of a fact, rather than a fact. The injury is a logical sequence of the facts. The acts of the defendants charged give the jurisdiction; and it is for the court to judge of the consequent evil. Many of the cases cited import, and some of them ex- press, the rule governing such cases. It not the averment of the pleader, but the nature of the acts pleaded, which is material on the questions of public injury. The conscience of the court must be satisfied; and it may be satified or not, with or without averment. If an information should aver public mis- chief, where the court could see that there was none, the averment would go for nothing. So, without averment, it suffices that the court can see the public injury. It was hardly questioned that, in these cases, a public injury is ap- parent in the acts charged against these defendants. Directly or indirectly, this injury reaches every inhabitant of the state, and affects the whole state in its corporate capacity. It was, inded, confidently foretold by the counsel for the defendants that obedience to the law would work a still greater public in- jury. Upon that, it is not for us to speculate. And if we could, we cannot sit here to offset a speculative injury irising from obedience of law, against a positive injury arising from disobedience of law. In these days of self-judg ing insubordination, it would ill-become this court to set so bad an example of compromise between the right and wrong. We cannot look to the conse- quences of legislation. Let the legislature see to that. We have no dis- cretion. We, at least, must obey the law. We can only see the direct pub. lic injury. And the acts charged satisfy the conscience of the court of the public injury. If the acts be illegal that is sufficient. Whether an information of this character would lie, as suggested by Mr. Brice, even though no definite injury had been done, or was likely to be done, to the public, we are not called upon to decide in these cases. III. These questions of jurisdiction settled, still leave some preliminary matters to be considered, before we can reach the provisions of chapter 273 of 1874, which the informations charge that the defendants dirsegard and vi- olate. The act has many provisions not material in these cases. And this is a convenient place to state briefly the provisions which are material to any consideration involved here. The act classifies all the railroads of the state; fixes different maximum rates for passengers for each class of roads; classifics certain specified articles of freight; fixes maximum rates for each of the classes of freight, differently affecting different classes of roads; provides civil remedies against the companies, and penalties against their servants, for taking greater rates than those fixed by the act; provides for railroad com- missioners, and gives, them authority to classify articles of freight not classi- fied by the act, and to reduce rates of freight; and provides civil remedis and penalties against the companies for taking greater rates than those fixed by the commissioners. It does not appear that the commissioners have acted in any way under the act; and the question of the validty of their powers is, therefore, not here. The act was approved by the Governor, March 11. It is contended for the defendants that it was repealed by chapter 292 and 341 of the same session; both approved by the Governor March 12. We have informed ourselves that the three acts passed the legislature in the same order in which they were ap- proved. This is a question of constructive repeal. In Attorney Geneyal v. Brown, 1 Wis., 513, this court adopted the uniform rule governing such cases. If there be two affirmative statutes upon the same subject, one does not repeal &quot; &quot;98 Appendix. newspaper printed and published in the county of Iowa.

The common law, which gave the original writs adopted by the constitu- tion, gave the forms of procedure. The jurisdiction of them, once ascer- tained, involved nothing difficult, nothing new; and when they were under consideration, the original jurisdiction of the court was easily asserted and discussed. It was natural that the court should overlook, it was fitting that the court should postpone the difficulty arising on original jurisdiction of in- formation until the writ itself should be applied for, and a proceeding taken to put its original jurisdiction of the writ in motion. And the questions are now here, for the first time, for settlement. What is that jurisdiction, what are its import and limits, how and at whose instance is it to be asserted? The writ does not of itself, like the rest of the group of writs given, furnish an answer to these questions. From the beginning of the discussion of these motions, this difficulty stared us in the face, and we called on the bar for a solution of it. On the one side, we were first told that the writ gives this court general equitable ju- risdiction, in all cases, between all parties, where injunction is prayed; thus substantially making this court one of general equitable jurisdiction, concur- rent with all the circuit courts of the state. Later in the discussion an attempt was made to limit this interpretation to cases in which perpetual injunction is the sole relief sought. This latter construction is hardly consistent with the indisposition of a court or equity to be the handmaid of other courts, or the general maxim that a court of equity, having once obtained jurisdiction for one purpose, will retain it for all purposes; or if consistent, not very avail- able as a limitation. And an original`equitable jurisdiction, however re- stricted, of purely private causes, concerning private interests, between pri- vate persons, would be wholly inconsistent with the manifest policy of the constitution to limit this court to appellate jurisdiction, superintending con- trol over inferior courts, and original jurisdiction in certain causes publici juris, as is held in Attorney General v. Blossom. It would be a gross blemish upon the symmetry and economy of the constitutional distribution of a juris- diction, a solecism against the judicial order observed in it, to attribute to the supreme court of the state original jurisdiction in one class of causes of pri- vate right which is carefully excluded in all other causes for no inherent dis- tinction; for no assignable reason, except that it seems to follow from words used for a different purpose; a purely accidental and incongruous jurisdic- tion, which was surely not designed. (See the cases in Missouri cited infra.) We could not accept so vicious and mischievous a construction, resting really upon an imputation of an inaccurate use of the terms in the constitution; and which after all does not fully meet the difficulty of jurisdiction given of a non- jurisdictional writ. On the other side it was suggested that the writ of injunction does not go at all to the original jurisdiction of the court; and that it is inserted where it is, in aid of the appellate or superintending jurisdiction of the court. This construction is properly rejected in Attorney General v. Blossom. The framers of the constitution appear to have well understood that, with appellate juris- diction, the court took all common law writs applicable to it; and with su- perintending control, all common law writs applicable to that; and that, fail- ing adequate common law writs, the court might well devise new ones, as Lord Coke tells us as 66 a secret in law.&quot; Hence the constitution names no writ for the exercise of the appellate or superintending jurisdiction of the court. But the original jurisdiction depends on the writs given, and hence the group of specific writs. The injunction given, mean what it may, apper- tains therefore to the original jurisdiction of the court. Again we are told that the writ of injunction was inserted in the class of original writs ex abundanti cautela, where it does not fit, where it performs no office, where it stands mere surplusage, signifying nothing, nudum verbum. We might sympathize with this way out of the difficulty, but we cannot ac- cept it. We cannot so deal with the charter of this court. We cannot so dis- pose of a jurisdictional word. Even in ordinary phrases, in an ordinary statute, dealing with an ordinary subject, verba aliquid operari debant, cum effecta sunt accipienda. And surely we cannot in the constitution which cre- ates the court, reject as superabundant and unmeaning, an independent, juris- &apos; &apos;Laws Relating to Railroads. 305 &amp;gt; and to acquire such depot grounds as might be necessary for the transaction of its business.
