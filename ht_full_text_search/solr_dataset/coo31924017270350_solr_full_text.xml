<field name="ocr"> &quot;54 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. ple shall take effect and become a law when it is approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon, and not otherwise. The term measure is used in every instance in said amendment, but where it excepts laws necessary to the immediate preserva- tion of the public peace, health, or safety.” The right to refer laws that are in effect is not reserved, but the right tv refer meas- ures, to wit: proposed laws, is reserved, and such construction gives effect to both sections 28 and 1, as amended, of article 4 of the constitution, and it is laid down as a rule in State v. Bacon, 14 South Dakota, page 394, and authorities cited in the opinion, “that in considering any provision of a constitution, the whole is to be examined with the view of arriving at the true intention of each part, and that effect is to be given, if possible, to the whole instrument, and to every section and clause. If different pro- visions seem to conflict, the courts must harmonize them, if prac- ticable, and must lean in favor of that construction which will ren- der every word operative, rather than one which makes some words idle and nugatory.” Applying the rule thus announced, section 28 read, together with section 1, as amended, must be construed as furnishing an additional exception to section 1 as amended, and if so, then when the legislature has declared certain facts to create an emergency, and the law to be in force and effect from and after its approval by the Governor, there is no power reserved to refer it to a vote. It is within one of the exceptions provided in the constitution, and is in force and effect after approval. Having reached that conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider whether or not said section 1 was legally amended. For the foregoing reasons, I ain of the opinion that the act under consideration went into effect upon its approval by the Governor. Respectfully, A. VI. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, March 3, 1903. HON. F. I. DINBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Your favor of the 2nd instant requesting my opin- ion as to when House Bill No. 85, providing for compensation of &quot; &quot;128 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. election of a State Printer, to hold the office for four years, and further provides that “He shall perform all the public printing for the State which may be provided by law.” Thus the constitu- tion definitely states who shall do the State printing, and it can not be done by any one else, until that section of the constitution is changed. The other question as to what constitutes State printing is not so easy of solution, as it is a question of law and fact combined ; one depending on the other. The rule which occurs to me at the present time as applicable to the matter is, that all printing for which the State is liable to pay is State printing, and should be done by the State Printer. No legal contract can be made with any other printer or printers for work to be paid for out of State funds or appropriations. Applying this rule to the bill under consideration, I am of the opinion that there is no authority of law to audit the bill, or to draw a warrant for the payment of the same. Yours respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, September 24, 1903. Ilon. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Referring to your inquiry as to whether the Mutual Benefit Burial Association, of Baker City, Oregon, is an insurance association within the purview of the insurance laws of this State, and is liable to pay the taxes and license fees provided for such corporations, permit me to say that I am of the opinion that it is not a life insurance company cr corporation. The object of said association, as expressed in its articles, is to provide for the pay- ment of the funeral and burial expenses of its members, and to pay the sum of one hundred dollars therefor to the undertaker furnish- ing such service, and in no case is it paid to the surviving relatives or friends as death benefits. The association, according to its ar- ticles handed me, is purely benevolent, and the one hundred dol- lars paid to pay funeral and burial expenses of the deceased cer- tainly comes within the exemptions menticned in section 3749 of &quot; &quot;[6] LARCENY, State v.

Respectfully submitted, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General, OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, February 12, 1901. Hon. EDMOND C. GILTNER. Secretary of Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition Commission, Portland, Oregon: DEAR Sir: Relative to yours of the 10th instant requesting my opinion as to whether your commission can sell fruits and other perishable exhibits from your exhibit to be made at St. Louis, and use the money thereby obtained for the purchase of other exhibits or for the replacing of such perishable exhibits, and whether you can sell your installation materials when your exhibit shall have served its purpose at St. Louis, or other articles which can be sold to advantage rather than be returned, and use the proceeds for buy- ing other exhibits of like nature for the Lewis and Clark Centen- nial Exposition; permit me to say that I am of the opinion that the commission has that authority by necessary intendment. Section 1 of the act authorizes the holding of an exhibition at Portland, Oregon, in 1905, and by means thereof to benefit the people of the State of Oregon by way of the advertisement and de- velopment of its agricultural and other resources. Your commission was appointed to carry out the provisions of the act, and by sec- tion 5 of the act empowered and required to expend not to exceed $50,000 in the collection and displaying of an exhibit of the re- sources of the State at the international exhibition at St. Louis in 1904, and to prepare or procure such exhibit as in its judgment shall be necessary or advisable, and when such exhibit shall have served its purpose at said international exhibition, so much there- of as shall be of value and suitable for that purpose shall be re- moved to Portland, Oregon, for use in the State exhibit in the year 1905. In order to make an agricultural exhibit, perishable products must necessarily be procured and exhibited, and there is Att&apos;y Gen. -11 &quot; &apos;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 197 Relief Association or the laws of Oregon which prohibit the asso- ciation from issuing such certificates, and am of the opinion they can lawfully do so. The foregoing conclusion renders it unnecessary to answer your second question, but I will call your attention to section 3745 of B. &amp;amp; C. Compilation, which apparently provides for the Insurance Commissioner to take action whenever an insurance company or association is doing business in violation of law. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 27, 1904. HION JEFFERSON MYERS, President of Lewis and Clark Centennial Er position Commission, Portland, Oregon: DEAR SIR: Replying to yours of recent date requesting my opinion as to whether it is the duty of the commission to make a full and complete exhibit of all the resources of the State at the Lewis and Clark Exposition to be held in Portland in 1905, permit me to say that public funds can be appropriated by the legislature only for a public use. The object for which the appropriation is made must tend in some way to promote the general welfare of the State. On no other principle can such appropriation be sustained. The Supreme Court of California and other States have so de- cided. The act creating the commission recognizes that principle. Section 1 requires the commission to hold “An exhibition of the arts, industries, manufactures, and the products of the river, soil, mines, forest, and sea * * and by means of said exhibition to bene- fit the people of the State of Oregon by way of the advertisement and development of its agricultural, horticultural, mineral, lumber manufacturing, shipping, educational, and other resources of said State.&quot; Subdivision (b) of section 3 of said act also expressly directs the commission to encourage, secure, and promote a full and com- plete exhibition of “the arts, industries, manufactures, and prod. ucts of the rivers, soil, mines, forest, and sea. This all relates to . &apos; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 95 ject. All necessary authority to carry out the purpose of the act are implied, if not expressly granted. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, May 12, 1903. HION, F. I. DU&apos;NBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Replying to yours of recent date as to whether or nct where the proof submitted with a claim of a county for refund of expenses incurred in providing for public charges shows that the pauper came to the county for the purpose of obtaining work, and has no family elsewhere, would be satisfactory proof of non- residence, and the county be entitled to a refund under section 2660 of Bellinger and Cotton&apos;s Code, or any expenses it may have incurred on account of the pauper; permit me to say that our statutes do not define what constitutes residence, and the only way is to examine what the courts hold to constitute legal residence, as legal residence is what the act evidently means. Vol. 2 of American and English Enclyclopedia of Law, 12th Edition, defines residence as follows: &amp;quot;A resident of a place is one whese place of abode is there, and who has no present inten- tion of removing therefrom.” Webster&apos;s Dictionary, as “The act or state of being seated or settled in a place; the act, state or habit of dwelling or abiding; the act or state of being a resident or in- habitant; the place where one resides; habitation.&amp;quot; 2 Bur. Law Dictionary, “It usually imports the place of one&apos;s permanent domi- cile, rather than a temporary abode.&amp;quot; Pol. Code of Cal. Sec. 52, “It is the place where one remains when not called elsewhere for labor or other special or temporary purpose, and to which he re- turns in seasons of repose.” There are many other definitions given by the courts, not all in harmony, but applicable to the cir- cumstances of the particular case under consideration. The term has no fixed meaning applicable to all cases, and its meaning must depend entirely upon the connection in which it is used. As used in 2660 of Bellinger and Cotton&apos;s Codes referred to, I think the last two definitions given above give the meaning intended by the &quot; &quot;INDEX. 217 PAGE 205 Examination of abstract..

STATE ATTORNEY-GENERIL. ** The powers and duties connected with the office of Attorney- General are so numerous and varied that it has not been the policy of the various legislatures to attempt the difficult task of enumer- ating them exhaustively, and they have ordinarily been content after expressly defining such as are deemed the most important to leave the residue as they may exist ať common law, so far as appli- cable to our jurisprudence and system of government.&quot; The case of Hunt v. Chicago, etc. R. Co. 20 Ill. 282, holds that in these jurisdictions where the common law has been adopted, wherever applicable, and so far as it has not been changed by stat- ute, a duty required of an Attorney-General by the rules of the common law is as much a duty required of him as though it were imposed by the express mandate of the statute. In the case of People v. Miner, 2 Laws (N. Y.), 397, the court said: “Mcst, if not all of the colonies appointed Attorney-Gen- eials,” and they were understood to be clothed with nearly all the powers of the Attorney-General of England, and as these powers have never been defined, we must go back to the common law in order to ascertain them. The Attorney-General had the power and it was his duty: **7th. By information to chancery to enforce trusts, and to pre- vent public nuisances, and the abuse of trust powers,&quot; and if the injury is of a public nature, the Attorney-General may, as a rule, maintain the action or proceeding. The above principles are supported by the following authori- ties: Atty.-Gen. 1. Albion Academy, 52 Wis. 469; Atty.-Gen. v. Chicago etc. R. Co. 35 Wis. 469; Atty.-Gen. v. Evart Booming Co. 34 Vich. 462; Atty.-Gen. 4. Detroit, 26 Mich. 263; People v. Sav- ing Society, 84 Cal. 634; People v. Reed, 81 Cal. 70; Atty.-Gen. v. Tudor Ice Co. 104 Man. 239, and by decisions in nearly all the States. The common law, as far as applicable to our institutions, pre- vails in our State, except where abrogated by statutory enact- ment. Houghton and Palmer v. Beck, 9 Or. 326; Cressy v. Tatum &apos; &apos;156 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. and conditions of any contract of insurance they may enter into; and have also placed property sufficient for that purpose within the jurisdiction of the courts of this State, that compliance with the terms of their contracts can be judicially enforced, if neces- sary. This being so, the principle of comity in this matter must be rejected as contrary to the policy of the State, as indicated by its legislation relative to insurance. Holding this view of the law, I am of the opinion that no foreign corporation can do a &quot;credit insurance in this State, until it pays the fees, and makes the deposit required of other insurance com- panies. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &amp;gt; OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, January 30, 1904. Hon. CHARLES S. MOORE, State Treasurer: DEAR Sir: Relative to yours of the 29th instant as to what course to pursue in cases where the county judge of a county has adjudged that relatives of an insane person were able to pay the ten dollars per month toward their support, and it transpires that such judgment was a mistake, permit me to say that the law makes it your duty to hand the matter over to the district attorney for collection, but I am of the opinion that the county judge should re-examine the matter, and if he finds that he has made a mistake he can revise his findings in that respect, and relieve the party from the judgment. It is, up to that date, an ex parte proceeding, and I am of the opinion that the party adjudged to pay can make the defense when the district attorney attempts to collect, that he is unable to pay, and if he proves it the court would have to hold ac- cordingly. A man is entitled to his day in court, and the deter- mination of a county judge can not deprive him of that right. However, a poor man should not, in justice, be compelled to stand a lawsuit to show that he is unable to pay, and I would advise that in those cases where you are advised that a party is not financially able to pay it would be well to return the matter to the county &apos; &quot;. &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 83 the same. Exempting the members of the Oregon National Guard from“all military, poll, or road tax, service on comitatus and jury,&amp;quot; is partly to compensate such members for their time, and also that the efficiency and discipline of the military can not be interfere] with or impaired by the civil authorities, and said section of the Military Code can not be held to be repealed by implication or ex- pressly, when all the circumstances are considered, and the law relating to repeals applied in the light of the foregoing decisions. Answering your second question as to whether House Bill No. 80, page 19, laws 1903, is repealed by House Bill 280, page 262, I find that No. 80 was approved by the Governor February 9, and filed in the office of the Secretary of State February 10, 1903, and provides for the election of road supervisors in the road districts of the State, and prescribes their terms of office, ctc. No. 180 was approved by the Governor February 24, 1903, and filed in the office of the Secretary of State the same day, and is the later act. It is a general law relating to the roads and highways of the State, and in several sections sets forth what the duties of road supervisors shall be, and then section 68 provides for their ap- pointment in the following language: “The county courts of the different counties of this State at their first regular term in Janu- ary, 1904, and annually thereafter shall appoint a road super- visor for each road district of their respective counties, who shall be a resident of the district for which he shall be appointed, and shall held his office for the term of one year, and until his successor is appointed and qualified.” The section covers everything contained in House Bill No.80, and differs in this, the bill reads, &amp;quot;At the gen- eral election in 1904, and every two years thereafter, there shall be elected in each election precinct in this State a road supervisor for each road district, etc.,&amp;quot; and provides a two years&apos; term. Said section 68 reads: “The county courts of the different coun- ties of this State at their first regular term in January, 1904, and annually thereafter, shall appoint a road supervisor for each road district of their respective counties, and provides a one-year term. The former provides for the election of supervisors by the people, and a term of two years, the latter for their appointment by the county court, and a term of one year. The two laws are in irreconcilable conflict, and both can not stand; and while I have no doubt it was the intention of the legislature to provide for the ܕܕ &quot; &quot;[ 9 ] White and Lee v.

The statute makes provision for this office to appear in the supreme court and try cases there in which the state may be interested, but imposes no duty or obligation to appear either in the United States court nor in the circuit courts of the state. This office, however, has prepared all the pleadings and briefs and tried these cases in the United States court of appeals, the United States circuit court and the state circuit courts, without assistance. Many of these cases that have been finally dis- posed of were of the most vital importance to the state, re- quiring close attention and much time and labor in preparation and trial. Those pending are no less so, the entire water supply of all the state institutions being involved in one, and over $30,000 in the other three. OFFICIAL OPINIONS.

This view of the case re- moves any federal question, and I think the safest way to proceed. When an order is made fixing a new date, the sheriff can proceed as though no interruption of the execution had occurred. At least this is my opinion from all the authorities I find touching the same. I have this day ordered the clerk to send down mandate. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, November 19, 1903. HON. CHARLES S. MOORE. State Treasurer: DEAR SIR: Relative to the matter of taxes referred to in the letter of Mr. E. B. Tongue, of the 11th instant, handed me for ex. amination, would say the taxes assessed against the land up to 190! are all subject to the lien of the State&apos;s mortgage on the land, and if the mortgage has been foreclosed, all parties claiming any in- terest or title by reason of tax sales, should be made parties de fendant, as well as the county. In the case of Middleton v. Moore, 73 Pac. 16, the court holds: “Under the law in force in 1897 anı! 1898, a tax did not cut off the lien of a mortgage anterior to the assessment and levy of the tax. The assessment being against the person, and not specially against the property, and the manner of collecting the tax being to make it out on the personal property, if such could be found, and, if not, then out of the realty.&amp;quot;. Under this statute only the interest of the person assessed passed by the deed. The law was not changed until February 27, 1901, (session laws 1901, page 248, S. B. No. 201, section 17) providing that a tax lien should have priority over any other incumbrance. Therefore the taxes referred to are all subject to the lien of the State&apos;s mortgage, provided that the mortgage is of date prior to the assessment and levy. Yours truly, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &quot;192 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. son can complain if it does not do so. Not insisting on forfeiture does not prejudice the purchaser, and the only other interested party is the State. And the board is not relinquishing any valu- able rights of the people, or giving away the State&apos;s property by not depriving a purchaser of his payments, solely because a little delinquent in one. The State is not equitably entitled, but could take advantage of the statute. The cases before the board are cases in which the State sold lands to which it never had title, and could not acquire it, and the question is whether under said sections 3310 and 3311, the purchaser is entitled to have his money re- funded, and I am of the opinion that he is. Said sections were evidently enacted to cover such cases, and we have seen that they affect future as well as past sales; and the fact that the State never had title prevents forfeiture. In the case of Van Kirk v. Paterson, 201 Penn. St. page 90, the court holds at page 95 that “The vendor is not entitled to forfeit the contract as against the vendee, when he is himself in no condition to perform, even though by the terms of the contract he has the right to declare it forfeited, and to retain what has already been paid if the vendee makes default.”&apos; Said sections are, in effect, a renunciation of the contract of sale in all cases of failure of title, and it is well settled that he who rescinds a contract must return to the other party whatever valu- able thing he may have received under the contract. The same doctrine is announced in Clark on Contracts, section 268 et seq., and section 85 announces the doctrine that a promise to do some- thing which is impossible in law is no consideration, and where the title fails there is no consideration for the money paid on the pur- chase price. Under the authorities, I am inclined to the opinion that the pur- chaser of real estate is entitled to have his money refunded in al! cases where the vendor can not convey title, even where there is no statute so directing. In the cases under consideration, the statute provides on the part of the State for doing what a court would adjudge a private citizen to perform, and I am of the opinion that the board should repay the purchase money in the cases mentioned in your communication.

The title was confirmed to the grantees of the state. IN THE CIRCUIT COURTS. Some of the most important cases tried or now pending in the circuit courts of the state are as follows: State of Oregon v. Baker County. Action to recover delinquent taxes. Judgment recovered and $10,968.60 paid to state treas- urer. Kinney v. State Board of Equalization. Writ of review to circuit court, Marion county, reviewing action of state board in raising tax 30 per cent. on merchandise in Jackson county. Motion to quash writ sustained. No appeal. &apos; &quot;194 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. House shows that only thirty votes were cast in favor of the bill. The journal showing “Yeas 30, Nays 21, absent 8,&amp;quot; and the memo- randum, “so the bill passed.&amp;quot; The number of members elected to the House of Representatives for that session is shown by the records to have been sixty, and is the number composing the House as fixed by law. Section 25 of article 4 of the Constitution of Oregon provides: “A majority of all the members elected to each house shall be necessary to pass every bill or joint resolution.” It takes no argument to show that thirty is not a majority of sixty. While the enrolled bill was signed by the Speaker of the House and President of the Senate, and was approved by the Governor and filed with the Secretary of State, the Journal of the House affirmatively shows that the bill did not receive the requisite num- ber of votes to pass that house, and the rule is laid down in Avery v. Southern Pacific Company, 21 Or. 566, that in order to ascer- tain whether a bill becomes a law, the courts may examine the Journals of the Legislative Assembly to see whether the constitu- tional requirements have been complied with, and on page 571 the court says: “When the journals show upon their face that said bill did not receive the requisite vote upon its final passage, and for that reason did not pass, it is difficult to see how the cfficial signa- tures could give it the force and effect of law.” In the case of McKinnon v. Cotner, 30 Or. 288, the court says: “The rule adopted in this State is that when it appears from the legislative journals that the enrolled act on file with the Secretary of State did not receive in either house the number of votes requisite for its passage, the act will be held invalid. This fact, however, must affirmatively be shown; mere silence of the records is not enough.&apos; Such is still the rule in this State, and the records in the matter under consideration showing the bill not to have received a sufficient number of votes in the House, the bill did not, in my opinion, be- come a law, and did not in any manner change the existing laws. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &apos;202 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. &amp;gt; lative powers are, as far as the title reveals the objects of the act, intended to be conferred upon the board, but its duties are to be prescribed in the act, and are set forth in section 2 thereof, and is given “general supervision of the interests of the health and life of the citizens of the State,&quot; shall keep vital statistics, make sani- tary investigations and inquiries concerning the causes and pre- vention of diseases, etc. It is also empowered to make and enforce quarantine regulations. The rule sought to be promulgated and enforced is not a quar- antine regulation, and if the power is conferred at all, it must be found in the clause empowering the board to make sanitary in- vestigations and inquiries respecting the causes and prevention of diseases, etc.” It does not seem necessary in such investigations to require that all plans of public buildings should be first ap- proved by the board. No authority is given the board to make changes in the plans or to enjoin the construction of the building if the plans were not approved. Section 10 of the act under con- sideration provides that in places having no local boards of health, or in case sanitary laws are inoperative, the State Board of Health shall have power and authority to order nuisances or the cause of any special disease or mortality to be abated or removed. The nuisance must exist or the board can not act, and I am unable to find anything in the act authorizing the board to prevent the con- struction of a building because in their opinion it might be un- sanitary after it was built. The general power to supervise the interests of the health and life of the citizens of the State, does not. in my opinion, confer the authority sought to be exercised. Yo penalty could be imposed for disobedience of such an order if made. The act creating the State Board of Health, section 10, provides a penalty for violations of an order to abate a nuisance or to remove the cause of any special disease or mortality, and section 21 pro- vides a penalty for violation of any section of the act. None is provided for the violation of a special order of the board. Therefore the order if made could not be enforced, and while it doubtless would be an excellent sanitary regulation, it can not, in my opinion. be established without further legislation. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General &apos; &apos;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 119 In no ten years prior to death stood in the acknowledged relation of par- ent, or to any lineal descendant born in lawful wedlock; in every such case the tax shall be at the rate of one per centum upon the appraised value thereof received by each person; then follows a proviso that any estate which may be valued at a less sum than ten thousand dollars, shall not be subject to any such duty or tax, and the tax is to be levied in above cases only on the excess of five thousand dollars received by each person; then follows an- other clause which states in substance that when such inheritance, etc., shall pass to an uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, or to any lineal descendant of the same, the rate shall be two per centum on the excess of two thousand dollars so received by each person; in all other cases the tax shall be at the rate of three per centum on all amounts exceeding five hundred dollars, and not exceeding ten thousand dollars, and increasing as the amount increases. other place in the act, except in the proviso in section 2, does the act state when an estate, if at all, shall be exempt from the tax, and that proviso exempts all estates under ten thousand dollars, and the section then provides different rates for different classes receiv- ing the benefits; the nearest relatives are only taxed one per centum, and that on the sums received in excess of five thousand dollars by each heir or beneficiary: the second class to pay two per centum on all sums received in excess of two thousand dollars; the third class on all sums received in excess of five hundred dollars. The words &quot;such duty or tax” in the proviso in section 2, refer to the luty or tax prescribed in section 1, as section 2 provides for no tax, but only the rate; also section 16 provides that the judge of each county shall within ten days after filing any will or application for letters of administration, if in his opinion the estate exceeds in value the sum of ten thousand dollars, cause the clerk of such court to send to the State Treasurer a certificate of the filing of such will or ap- plication for letters of administration, and the county court, as soon as practicable, must determine the value of every inheritance, devise, bequest, or legacy embraced in or payable out of the estate in which such letters are granted, and the tax due thereon. The State Treasurer is entitled to notice under said section 16 only in estates exceeding in value ten thousand dollars, and I am of the opinion that section 16, when read with section 2 before mentioned, &apos; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 145 Of the land described in certificate No. 10, 1,214.09 acres have been patented to the State, leaving 1,228.66 acres unpatented. Of the patented land, applicant alleges that it has all been sold by the State to other parties. All the land so patented, and sold by the State as aforesaid, was patented and sold as swamp land, in 1885, 1890, 1901, and 1902. Applicant now asks repayment, with five per cent. interest, under sections 3310 and 3311 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. The certificates were issued under the law of 1870, which pro- vided that reclamation should be made in ten years, and the bala ance of eighty per cent of the purchase price paid, or the applicant forfeit all right to the land, and all he had paid thereon. In 1887 the legislature, by act duly passed, declared the sale of all swamp lands sold under the provisions of the act of 1870, which had not been reclaimed, according to the provisions of the act, forfeited, and the certificates of sale void, and the board was authorized to cancel the same. The same act also provided that on the surrender of any of these void certificates, the board would repay the amount paid thereon. At this time the applicant was entitled to repayment without interest. In 1891 the law was amended to allow repayment at eight per cent. interest, unless it was shown that applicant had derived some benefit from the use of the land. In 1899, the law was again amended as it now appears in said section of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. above referred to, so far as the same relates to repayment of principal and interest thereon. The amendment changed the rate of interest to five per cent. per annum, and provides that no interest shall be allowed or paid where the purchaser by reason of his payment to the State had the use, or could have had the use and possession of the land upon which the payment was made. There is nothing in the record to show that the applicant could not have had the pos- session of the land he applied to purchase. It was not in the pos- session of other parties, and it was in 1885 before the State began to sell to others. If he had taken possession at once, he could have remained in possession, and it was his own fault if he did not. There were no homesteads or pre-emption, or other claims thereto under the United States land laws, and he should have taken pos- session of his purchase. I am of the opinion that the law as to interest, section 3311 above mentioned, means that there must have been some valid adverse Att&apos;y Gen.-10 &quot; &quot;130 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. propriation in endeavoring to obtain appropriations from Con- gress, or other States, in aid of the exposition.&amp;quot; The claim under consideration is for $2.50 for printing five hun- dred copies of resolutions presented to, and indorsed by the Trans- Mississippi Congress; said resolutions requesting the aid of the National Congress, the request to be made by the Congressional Representatives of the Original Oregon Country for an appropria- tion of a million dollars for the general purposes of the exposi- tion, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for Lewis and Clark Memorial Building, and ten thousand dollars for Chemawa Indian School Exhibit. The title of the act, laws of 1903, page 6, in no way limits the commission to an exhibition of the arts, industries, manufactures, and products of the soil, rivers, mines, forests, and sea, made, pro- duced, and manufactured in the State of Oregon; but a casual reading of the act shows that it was intended to be inter-state, and international in its scope. The title reads: &amp;quot;To celebrate the one hundredth anniversary “ of the exploration of the Oregon Country,” and in the body of the act it frequently refers to the Original Oregon Country. It pro- vides for the erection of a memorial building, which shall be per- manent, and the property of the state, to receive and safely keep therein &amp;quot;Any and all statues, works of art, publications, maps, charts, or cther property that may be given, donated, or granted to the State of Oregon in trust as aforesaid, or authorized by the United States, or territory thereof, or any foreign country;&amp;quot; thus indicating its international character. Also subdivision (f)of section 3 of said act requires the com- mission to act in connection with the Lewis and Clark Centennial and American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Oregon for the purpose as set forth in its charter, “To hold an American Pacific and Oriental Fair, and an exhibition of the industries, arts, manufactures, and products of the soil, mines, and sea, in the City of Portland, Oregon, during the year 1905,&amp;quot;&apos; to be state, inter-state national, American, and Oriental in its character. Reference to the said articles of incorporation leaves no chance for argument as to the scope and character of the exposition. Subdivision (b) of section 3 of said act of 1903, provided that &quot; &quot;[5] 16. State v. James Roach.

The defendant was in- dicted and convicted in Umatilla County of the crime of lar- ceny. From the judgment rendered on the verdict he ap- pealed, and said judgment was reversed July 30, 1899. 18. State v. Fred Haines. The defendant was indicted and convicted in the Circuit Court for Harney County, of the of- fense of selling liquor without a license. He appealed to the Supreme Court, and the judgment rendered by said Harney County Circuit Court was reversed July 31, 1899. 19. State v. Lavery. The defendant was indicted in the Circuit Court for Harney County, of the crime of assault with intent to kill, and was found guilty of the crime of an assault with a dangerous weapon. From the judgment rendered on the verdict he appealed, and the judgment was affirmed on August 11, 1899. 20. State v. James Weaver. The defendant was indicted . in the Circuit Court for Harney County for murder in the first degree, and the jury by their verdict found him guilty of murder in the second degree.

Indicted and convicted of the crime of assault with a dangerous weapon, in the Cir- cuit Court of Harney County, and sentenced to pay a fine of $250.00.

S. page 524. This was under a statute which authorized the auditor (assessor) to issue compulsory process to require the attendance of witnesses and to examine them on cath, and providing for punishment as for contempt in case of refusal to obey subpoena to testify. Our statutes confer no authority on assessors to issue compulsory process to compel witnesses to attend, but in the light of the fore- going decision, the legislative assembly could so provide, and I have been unable to find that said decision has ever been disap- proved. While the act is indefinite in many respects, it might be held good by the courts, if it had been duly enacted. The legisla- tive assembly has, in my opinion, the power to compel the officers of any banking institution, or express company, or association doing business within this State to furnish a list of depositors to the assessor, but in the present instance, I think the attempt to pass such an act failed. The title of the act is, “An Act to Empower Assessors to Assess Bank Deposits.” The body of the act is to compel the officers of the bank to furnish a list of the depositors, and providing a fine if they fail to do so on the request of the as- sessor. The test as to whether the subject of the act is expressed in the title, as laid down in the case of Spaulding Logging Co. v. Independence I. (&apos;0. 42 Or. 394, as stated by the court at page 398 thereof is, “Whether taking from the title the subject we can find anything in the body of the act which can not be referred to that subject.&amp;quot; The subject of the act under consideration is to authorize asses- sors to assess bank deposits. The body of the act requires the assessors to call upon bank officers and procure a sworn statement of the names of depositors, and to fine such officers if they fail to furnish it. The fining of the officers is not included in the title, to authorize assessors to asses bank deposits. Any person reading the title would naturally conclude that the purpose of the act was to confer the power upon the several county assessors of the state to assess the money deposited in banks, and they would not for a moment suppose that it was intended to compel bank officials to furnish lists of depositors to assessors, or to punish them by a fine if they failed so to do at the request of the assessor. &quot; &quot;12 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. tificates of delinquency therefor, and I can see no reason why the bill is not constitutional, and in all respects just and equitable. Its provisions seem to protect all parties, amply provide for re- demption, and I believe, if enacted into law, it will greatly facili- tate the collection of taxes, and that the counties of the State will not be obliged to buy in nearly the amount of land they do under the present mode of collecting delinquent taxes. The bill seems to have been very carefully drawn, and I have no amend- ments to suggest, and think it a meritorious and much needed measure. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, February 9, 1903. Hon. J. M. SHELLEY, II ouse of Representatives: DEAR SIR: In accordance with your request, I have carefully examined Ilouse Bill No. 73, as to whether same discriminates in favor of millers. Sections 1 and 2 seem to refer to warehouse- men only, in the sense the word is customarily used, but section 11 defines what the words &amp;quot;Warehouseman&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Warehousemen shall mean when used in connection with the act, and taking the meaning as defined in said section 11, the only class of mills not within the purview of the act, in my opinion, is what is usually called “custom mills.&apos;&apos; The language of the act, for “hire or other valuable consideration,&amp;quot; I think is broad enough to cover all mills and warehouses which store grain for any consideration whatever, regardless of the nature of the kind of the consideration. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, February 9, 1903. HON. GILBERT W.

I am satisfied that whatever right the said street railway company may have is so remote that it should not be considered an obstacle sufficient of itself to reject the con- tract if otherwise acceptable, and there is now no legal objection to the acceptance of the deed, and payment of the money therefor. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 17, 1903. HION. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR Sir: Relative to yours of the 8th instant, as to whether expenses incurred outside of the State of Oregon, by the State Board of Health, can be charged up to, and paid out of the State Board of Health Fund, provided by laws of 1903, pages 82 to 86 in- clusive, I would say that I am of the opinion that such expenses could not be paid out of the fund. Section 6 of the act provides for the annual salary of the secre- tary, and the traveling expenses of the board, while employed on the business of the board. Section 5 provides that the secretary shall, so far as practicable, communicate with other state boards of health, but on careful reading of the act. I am of the opinion that this would be by letter, and not by personal interview. Sec- tion 3 of the act provides that the board shall have authority to send its secretary, or a committee of the board, to any part of the state when deemed necessary to investigate the cause of any un- usual disease, or mortality, or any especially dangerous disease. While the board may have had the authority, even if the act had not so stated, the statement of it shows that the legislature con- sidered it necessary to specially grant the authority, and if it had intended the board to have the authority to incur expenses outside of the State, it would have added that when defining the board&apos;s authority. Therefore I am of the opinion that the board can not incur traveling expenses outside of the State of Oregon. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &quot;96 ReporT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. legislature in passing the act, and therefore am of the opinion that a person who comes to the State with the intention only of securing employment, although he has no family elsewhere, is a non-resident in the meaning of the act. If, however, he comes into the State with the intention of remaining, and making it his home, then even though he came seeking work only, he would be a resident, as the change of residence would be complete by the union of the act and intent; otherwise he must have been an actual inhabitant of the State long enough, and his conduct such that the intent to become a resident can be inferred from the length of time he has been an actual inhabitant, and his conduct. Under the facts submitted in your letter, I am of the opinion that the county is entitled to refund of expenses. I have examined the form of application you submitted for non-residents to make out and verify when applying to the county court for assistance, and would suggest that you add thereto the following question: Did you come to this State with the intention of establishing your residence in the State? If you came to this county for the purpose of securing work, did you intend to return to any other place when your term of employ- ment should cease? If you failed to secure employment, what did you intend to do? I herewith return the form of application. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL.

Laws of 1891, page 791. Also our Supreme Court, in the case of Cook v. Port of Port- land, 20 Or. 580, decided directly that the Port of Portland is a municipal corporation; thus leaving no question of doubt as to its being a municipal corporation. It being a municipal corpora- a tion, the bonds issued by it in pursuance of law can be accepted as a deposit of a surety company, if the market value of such bonds is at or above par. If you are satisfied that the market value of the bonds is at par, then if they meet the requirements of law in other respects, they meet the requirements of section 3759 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. as amended, laws of 1903, page 224; but I find nothing which authorizes you to accept bonds selling at less than par, al- though they may sell only slightly less than par. The par value is the standard prescribed by statute, and no one but the legisla- ture has the right to substitute any other. As to the opinion of my predecessor rendered July 16, 1902, to the effect that the Port of Portland is not a municipal corporation, I think he overlooked the section of the State Constitution, and the decision of the Supreme Court above referred to, as he was certainly in error upon that point. I herewith return Mr. Blackburn&apos;s opinion. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, September 17, 1903. Hox. F. I.

Office on February 18th, and filed with the Secretary of State Feb- ruary 19, 1903. The bill has an emergency clause attached, which is sufficient to give it foree and effect from and after its approval by the Gov- The Governcr did not approve the same, but allowed it to go out of his power and authority without his approval. This, in my opinion, would bring the bill within the principle estah- lished in the case of Biggs 1. McBride, and it would become a law as soon as the law-making power had done everything in relation thereto necessary under the constitution to its complete enactment as a law. The bill being filed in the office of the Secretary of State without the Governer&apos;s approval or disapproval, became a law as soon as so filed. The Governcr, not approving the bill, did not have the force of disapproval, and was tantamount to approving it so far as the time of its taking effect was concerned. When the bill was filed with the Secretary of State, all things necessary, under the constitution, for its complete enactment as law had been done, and it became a law forthwith. As to the effect the referendum amendment to the constitution has on bills with sufficient emergency clauses attached, permit me to say that I am of the opinion that section 28 of article 4, and section 1 as amended, do not conflict, and that section 28 is an ad- ditional exception to these given under section 1, as amended, as to when the referendum may be ordered.

F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Relative to your inquiry as to the last day upon which petitions under section 1 of article 4 of the State Constitu- tion, for the initiative may be filed, permit me to say, I am of the opinion that February 5th at 12 o&apos;clock midnight is the latest moment you can file a petition. The section of the constitution above referred to reads: &amp;quot;Initiative petitions shall be filed with the Secretary of State not later than four months before the elec- cion at which they are to be voted upon.&amp;quot; It is almost universally held in this country, that when the word “month” is used in any statute relative to the time within which any thing or act is to be done, that calendar months are to be con- sidered as intended, unless there is something to the contrary in the statute; and our Supreme Court in the case of Grant v. Paddock, 30 Or. 316, has held that section 531 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. applies to all computations of time. Said section provides that “The time within which a thing is to be done, as provided in this Code, shall be computed by excluding the first day and including the last, etc. Applying these rules to the computation of the four months un- der the said section 1 of article 4 of the constitution, and remem- bering that we must have not less than four months, which means four full months must elapse after the petition is filed before the election. The election will be held June 6th next, an] to be before that day the four months must end at midnight of June 5th. Count- ing backwards by calendar months, we find that the four months commence at midnight of February 5, 1904, and said day is the last day upon which petitions can be legally filed. Respectfully, A. VI. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &quot;76 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 1 OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, April 14, 1903. Hon. J. H. ACKERMAN, Superintendent of Public Instruction: DEAR SIR: Yours of the Sth instant propounded the following question: &amp;quot;May two members of a district school board select a teacher before the annual meeting, or before the organization of the new board to serve for the ensuing year?&apos;&apos; The last clause of subdivision 3 of section 47, page 35 of school laws of 1901 provides, “A majority of the board shall constitute a quorum to do business.&apos;&apos; Two constitutes a majority of a board of three, and therefore two may hire a teacher. The other part of the question is in substance, can two directors hire a teacher at this time whose term is to commence next Sep- tember, when the term of one director expires in June? The expiration of the term of a director in no way limits his authority while he is a director, and he is fully authorized to trans- act any of the business of the district so long as he is a director. Presuming the contract to be in the usual form, I am of the opinion it is valid. If it was fraudulently entered into it could be avoided, but there appears to be nothing of a fraudulent na- ture relative to the contract. The directors, it is presumed, were legally elected and qualified, and entered into the contract at a meeting of the board duly and legally called, and in all respects legally conducted. It may have been necessary to employ a teacher scme time in advance of the commencement of the term, to secure the services of a competent person. Subdivision 7 of section 48 of school laws of 1901, making it the duty of the directors to employ teachers, is general in its nature, and does not limit the directors to the employment of teachers whese employment shall not extend beyond the term of such directors, nor beyond the end of the school year in which they are employed, and therefore if the contract is made in good faith, without collusion or fraud, and with due regard to the welfare and interests of the district, it is valid. This doctrine is held in the case of Wait 1. Ray, 67 N. Y. 36. Earl J. in delivering the opinion of the court in construing a similar statute says: “It would be a strange construction of the statutes which would determine the teacher&apos;s contract with every termination of the trustee&apos;s office. &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 117 OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, July 7, 1903. Hox. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Relative to the letter of Mr. C. W. Brownfield, of date 29th ultimo, contending that the Oregon Building and Loan Association, a corporation organized under the laws of this State, and doing business at Pendleton, Oregon, should not be required to pay the annual license fee provided by section 5 of House Bill No. 2, laws of 1903, page 43, for the reason that the same is exempt from taxation under the laws of this State, and the provisions of said act, I am of the opinion that the position is not well taken. The act of 1903 does not purport to be a tax upon the property or business of a corporation, but is rather a license for the fran- chise or right to do business in the State, and is in the nature of police regulation. If considered as a tax, they would not be ex- empt from taxation under the rule laid down in Benevolent Socie- ties 1. Kelly, 28 Or. 192, in which Bean, C. J., defines a charitable institution to be “An institution organized for benevolent and charitable purposes, free from any element of private or corporate gain, and which devotes its entire revenue to the payment of cur- rent expenses, and the relief of the poor and needy, although it may confine its benefits primarily to its own members and their families.” The corporation in question, according to its articles, is formed for the purpose of carrying on and conducting a building and loan association, to deal in real estate and personal property, to accumu- late funds from subscriptions to its capital stock, contributions of stockholders, deposits, profits from investments, money borrowed by, or deposited with the corporation, and to loan the same to its members, or other persons, to take mortgages to secure the same, and to foreclose them, to receive money on deposit, and allow inter- est therefor, and to invest and deal in personal and real property. Such a corporation does not come within any of the provisions of the constitution or laws of this State exempting property from taxation; it is not a literary, charitable or religious institution or corporation, but is purely for the purpose of profit, and the fact that the profit goes to the members does not make it a charitable institution under the rule before cited. &quot; &quot;180 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, April 25, 1904. Hon. H. G. VAN DUSEN, Master Fish Warden, Astoria, Oregon: DEAR Sir: Relative to yours of the 20th instant requesting my opinion as to whether the amount of fees to be collected from the pickled or salted product of salmon, under section 4095 of B. &amp;amp; C. Compilation as amended, session laws of 1903, pages 220 and 221, should be based upon the fish taken from the water or the dressed product, permit me to say that I am of the opinion that the dressed product was intended to govern. A statute can not be construed solely from one section thereof, but must all be looked to in gather- ing the intent of the legislature as to its meaning, and you will observe that section 4094, as amended in 1903, pages 219 and 220, provides that the canner&apos;s license shall be based upon the finished product. The next section provides for all other dealers, packers, etc., and bases the license upon the number of tons handled, and the word &amp;quot;handled,&amp;quot; as there used, means, in my opinion, put on the market or prepared for the market, and the books of the dealer can be inspected for the purpose of determining the amount han- dled. Also section 1096 of B. &amp;amp; C. Compilation reads that “The Fish Warden is not bound by the statements therein (in the books) made as to the amount of fish packed, etc.&amp;quot; The words &amp;quot;packed or handled” show that the legislature was considering the product when ready for market. Had it intended otherwise, it would have used language showing that the weight should be taken at the time the fish are received at the packing or cold-storage house. Further, there is no justice in allowing canners to base returns on the finished product and denying that right to packers. The fact that a salmon will weigh nearly as much when frozen and placed in cold storage ready for shipping as when caught, does not change the principle, and I presume it costs the cold-storage man less to prepare his fish, and he sells on the same basis as that on which he pays license.

ACKERMAN, Superintendent of Public Instruction: DEAR SIR: Replying to yours of the 14th instant requesting my opinion as to whether paragraph “a” under subdivision 7, page 20, Oregon school laws, 1903, applies to second- and third-grade certificates, permit me to say that I am of the opinion that it does not. Said paragraph prescribes the qualifications required for a cer- tificate of the first grade, and, among others, that the applicant shall make a general average of not less than ninety per cent. of all branches prescribed by law, and shall not fall below seventy per cent. in any one branch. Then the following proviso: “Pro- vided, that whenever an applicant has upon two successive ex- aminations received ninety per cent. or more in one branches, said applicant may at the next examination thereof be excused from examination upon such branches and be credited with the standing so earned.&amp;quot; Nothing is found referring to cer- tificates of the second and third grades. Paragraph &amp;quot;b&amp;quot; of page 21 provides for second-grade certificates, and we find among its provisions the following: “Nor shall any person be entitled to receive more than one second-grade certificate in any one county, except when such person has not had the requisite teaching ex- perience to entitle them to a first grade; and paragraph “d” of said subdivision provides for the issuance of third-grade cer- tificates, and that only one third-grade certificate shall be issued to any person, except when such person has not had the required teaching experience to entitle them to a second grade. Nothing is said in either case relative to applicants being excused from any examination in any branches, or under any circumstances. third-grade certificate is good for one year, and only three months&apos; teaching experience is required to entitle the holder to a second grade. It can easily be acquired during the life of the certificate. A second-grade certificate is good for two years, and only twelve months&apos; teaching is required to entitle a teacher to receive a first- grade certificate, and there is ample time to acquire the same dur- ing the two years&apos; life of the second grade. The exceptions men- tioned in the provisions for second and third grades, that if they &quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;114 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. merce for a foreign corporation to sell and set up machinery in a State where it has no agency or office,&amp;quot; and being such can be regu- lated by Congress only.

There is no doubt in my mind that it is the duty of the commis- sion to make as full and complete an exhibit of all the resources of the State at the 1905 fair in Portland as the funds at the com- mittee&apos;s disposal for that purpose will permit. As to the commission preparing publications advertising the re- sources of the State, to be distributed at the fair, I am of the opinion that it is a matter resting wholly in the good judgment of the commission. Advertisement of the resources of the State is cer- tainly within its authority, and the time, quantity, and quality of the same must be left to the sound discretion of the commission.

Brown, Clerk of State Land Board: DEAR SIR: Replying to your communication of the 30th ultimo to this office relative to the tax claim of Carey F. Martin against the E. 1-2 of N. W. 1-4 and X. 1-2 of S. W. 1-4 of section 22, township 9 S., range 2 E. W. V., known as the Snyder place, we have the honor to report that the State Land Board held a mortgage on said land dated December 8, 1892; on October 31, 1898, a decree of fore- closure was duly entered in favor of the board decreeing the sale of said land under said mortgage; on December 17, 1898, the sheriff duly sold said land under said decree, to said State Land Board, and said sale having been duly reported and confirmed, said sheriff on the 9th day of August, 1900, duly made, executed. and delivered to said board the usual sheriff&apos;s deed for said prem- ises. The title to said land at the time of the execution of the said mortgage was in one Alice Snyder, who with her husband executed the same. In the year 1900 said lands were assessed to one C. D.

WHITNEY, State Printer: DEAR SIR: Replying to your question as to whether the State Printer is required to publish the notice relating to the taking up of estrays of over the value of $15, in the State Printer&apos;s paper, as provided in section 4264 of Bellinger and Cotton&apos;s Annotated Codes and Statutes of Oregon, I am of the opinion that he does nct, and for the following reasons: In the year 1853 (Laws 1853, page 468, section 8) a law was passed providing that “It shall be the duty of the Territorial Printer to publish, in the columns of the newspaper by him pub- lished, all laws by the clerk so furnished within twenty days after their passage, etc,” and providing for his compensation for such service. This act would seem to establish a Territoral newspaper to be published by the Printer, by implication at least, though there is no direct provision for so doing, especially when taken in con- nection with the act relating to estrays of the same year, pro- viding that the notice of the taking up of an estray of the value of more than fifteen dollars, shall be published in the Territorial paper. The two acts quoted clearly show an intention, on the part of the Territorial legislature, to provide for a Territorial newspaper, to be published by the Territorial Printer, although nct providing for one in direct terms, still cn the general princi- &quot; &apos;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. The case of Biggs v. McBride, 17 Or. 647, holds that legislative determination that certain facts constitute an emergency is not reviewable, and the same doctrine is supported by Carpenter v. Montgomery, 7 Blackf. 415, Hendrickson v. Hendrickson, 7 Ind. 13, Mark v. State, 15 Ind. 98, and many other authorities from other states which it is not neces- sary to mention are to the same effect. In Carpenter v. Montgomery, above cited, the court says: “That of the existence of the emergency the legislature must necessarily be the judges, and when thay deem it to exist they have the right to declare a statute in force from and after its passage.” And the legislature so declared in this bill, and I am of the opinion that the declaration is not reviewable. The only other question is whether the bill is subject to the power of the referendum reserved by the people in section 1 of the constitution above referred to. The two sections, 1 and 28, must be read together, and when so read, say that unless an emergency is declared, a bill will not take effect until ninety days after adjournment of the session, except the bill be necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, or safety. The legislature, when it declared that the “usefulness for good of the institution is retarded thereby, etc.,” and Jeclared an emer- gency to exist, must have had in mind both of these sections of the constitution, and considered that the immediate restoration of the usefulness of the institution was necessary for the immediate pres- ervation of the public peace and safety, the act providing for the confinement of juvenile offenders against the law, and for their discipline, education, employment, and reformation. No one can deny that such an institution tends to promote public peace and safety, and while the legislature did not in haec verba say that the bill was excepted from the power of the referendum. I think that such was the effect of section 4 of the act. I am further strengthened in this belief from the wording of said section 1, as amended. “The veto power of the Governor. shall not extend to measures referred to the people;&quot;&amp;gt; &quot;All elections on measures re- ferred to the people,” etc., and “any measure referred to the peo- &apos; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 25 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE STATE OF OREGON, FOR MARION COUNTY.

DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR Sir: Relative to the application of Seymour H. Bell, of Sumpter, Oregon, to withdraw the draft of $175, which he for- warded you some time since for State license tax on the Victory Consolidated Mining Company, permit me to say that I am of the opinion that the draft should be returned. The men who proposed to organize a corporation, it appears from the application, pro- ceeded no farther than to execute articles of incorporation and file and record the same as required by law, of which proposed cor- poration Mr. Bell was to be a member. After filing the articles, his associates have neglected and refused to proceed further in the the matter, and have not completed nor organized the same in any manner, and there never has been a duly organized corporation. Under the statute of 1903, section 1, the tax applies to every corpo- ration hereafter organized and formed for profit under, by, or pur- suant to the laws of this State, therefore an attempt to organize a corporation, I do not consider taxable under the statute, ani? think that Mr. Bell should not be required to lose his $175, as the proposed corporation has never been organized.

The opposite construction would render the law inoperative un- less the consent of the directors of the district in which the child resides was obtained also, and if that were intended, it would have been inserted in the law. The legislature evidently never conferred the power upon the board of directors to be exercised or not at its discretion, as it has left nothing for it to decide ex- cept perhaps as to whether the request and permit are properly signed and sufficient in themselves to be a request and a permit, and when sufficient papers are presented, the power is called into exercise, and the transfer must be made. In my opinion, the word “may” should be construed to mean “must” or “shall” in the statute under consideration. Respectfuly submitted, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, February 3, 1903. Hon. Chas. S.MOORE, State Treasurer, Salem. Oregon: DEAR SIR: Replying to your question as to whether School District No. 12, of Crook County, has a right to issue bonds, un- der the proceedings recently had in said district, for the purpose of authorizing the district to issue bonds to buy a site and build a school house, a copy of which proceedings you have handed me. and which are herewith returned, permit me to say that the board of directors has no authority under said proceedings to issue or sell bonds, for the following reasons: 1st. No petition of ten or any other number of legal voters of said district was presented to the school board, requesting a meet- ing to be called, as required by subdivision 31 of section 3389 of Bellinger and Cotton&apos;s Codes. 2nd. The notice of the meeting does not notify the voters that the &quot; &quot; A &quot; &quot;196 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. association has then provided for issuing a paid-up certificate to a member, by the applicant paying such sum in addition to the usual payments as shall be shown to be equal to the amount which is paid upon assessment certificates for the same amount and time. Experience must teach the average amount paid upon certificates for fire losses during a definite period of time, and the by-laws above mentioned direct that the advance assessment for losses on paid-up certificates be measured by that rule. The question is, therefore, whether that rule is in contravention of law. The by-laws provide the rule, and there is nothing in our stat- utes directly prohibiting the same, and if the mutuality is pre- served, the company is not exceeding its powers in issuing paid-up certificates. The principal of mutuality is conceded by all the authorities to consist in the fact that each member is to contribute pro rata to the common fund. In Vol. 2, Mays on Insurance, sec- tion 548, the author says: “The fact that there is no further liability on the part of the inember, if the possible extent of his liability is met by payment of cash in advance, does not militate against the principle of mutuality.” In the 16 Vol. Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, at page 878, the rule is an- , nounced relative to mutual companies that “The premiums may, consistently with the principle of mutuality, in the absence of a charter provision to the contrary, be paid in cash as well as in assessable notes, or may be paid in both cash and notes,”&apos; and many cases are cited in support of the proposition. In the case of Union Insurance Company v. Hoge, 21 Howard (U. S.) at page 64, the court says: “The theory of a mutual insurance company is, that the premiums paid by&apos; each member for the insurance of his prop- erty constitute a common fund, devoted to the payment of any losses that may occur,&amp;quot; and that “the cash premium may as well represent the insured in the common fund as in the premium note; and this class of companies has been so long engaged in the busi- ness of insurance, it may well be that they can determine, with sufficient certainty for all practical purposes, the just difference in the rates of premium between cash and notes.&amp;quot; I find no authorities holding that a mutual insurance company can not issue a paid-up policy when the premium so paid in advance is sufficient to cover all possible future liabilities, unless the charter or the statutes forbid, and I can find nothing in the charter of the Oregon Fire &quot; &quot;70 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. et al, 9 Or. 541; State v. Minnick, 33 Or. 158; French v. Cresswell, 13 Or. 418. Applying the foregoing principles to the question under con- sideration, it appears that the Attorney-General has the right to bring a proceeding to abate or enjoin a public nuisance under the common law, and therefore it makes no difference whether or not the language of section 2421 is broad enough to include that. The enumeration of some duties does not exclude others. However, he has no right to proceed unless the facts complained of consti- tute a public nuisance. The facts stated are in substance; that M. has maintained a dam in Rock Creek for many years to generate power to operate a small mill of some kind; that quite a number of people own land on the creek above said dam, and the same is covered with a heavy growth of fine timber; quite a quantity of the same has been cut, and is in the water, but can not be floated over said dam, or by it, without a passage-way by gate or flume is provided there- in, which M. positively refuses to construct, or allow others to construct. Presuming the statement to be true, I am of the opinion that it constitutes a public nuisance. Wood on Nuisances, 1st Vol. page 95, defines a public nuisance to be “something which affects the rights of individuals only as members of the public;&amp;quot; as obstructions of a highway, an en- croachment thereon, obstructions of navigable streams or encroach- ments on the rights of the public therein, etc. Any use of property that produces a nuisance to an individua! may be the subject of an indictment, if it is also in any way injuri- ous to the public. Our State has declared all streams capable of floating logs at any season of the year navigable streams, and public highways for that purpose. Weise v. Smith, 3 Or. 415; Felger and Pearson v. Robinson and Henderson, 3 Or. 455; Nutter v. Gallagher, 19 Or. 375; Haines v. Hall, 17 Or. 165. See Judge Lord&apos;s concurring opinion. Therefore it is my opinion that the State, by its Attorney-Gen- eral, can maintain a suit to abate or enjoin a public nuisance created by maintaining a dam across a navigable stream, to the injury of the rights of the people to navigate the same. Very respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &apos;74 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. declaration shall be accompanied by a certified copy, etc.,&quot; and provides how it shall be certified. That certified copy is the evi- dence that the company desiring to do business is a corporation duly incorporated and authorized to transact business. In the case of a corporation which has been, perhaps for many years. lawfully transacting business in the state as such corporation, their right to do so is admitted, and they would be estopped from denying that they were duly incorporated. Therefore there is no reason why they should furnish the evi- dence of something which is already admitted to be established, and I have no doubt the framer of the bill, and the legislature so considered the matter when preparing and enacting the law. Therefore it is my opinion that the class of corporations men- tioned in section 8 of the act are not required to file certified copies of their articles of incorporation or charter, but are required to file the declaration mentioned in section 7.

After this action was begun, the legislature in special session in December, 1903, created the Board of Commis- sioners of Canals and Locks, consisting of the same State officers, and authorized said commission to secure the right of way for the United States Government canal around the said obstructions of the Columbia River, which right of way would necessarily traverse a considerable portion of the same ground as the right of way for the portage railway. For this reason the Board of Pertage Commissioners decided to abandon this proceeding. The case was therefore dismissed. &quot; &quot;20 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. No. 20. R. G. KEENE. Appellant, V.

The license act of 1903 exempts the following corporations: Fire, marine, fire and marine, life, accident, life and accident, plate glass, and steam boiler insurance companies, and surety companies. No other business corporations are exempt, but corporations formed for educational, literary, scientific, religious, or charitable pur- poses, are exempt. Building and loan associations are not included in any of the above exempt classes; they are not educational, lit- erary, scientific, religious, or charitable, and in my opinion must pay the annual license fees provided by section 5 of the act. While it may be burdensome on this class of corporations, I see no way for you to relieve them. You can do nothing but collect the fees pre- scribed by the act, and the amount of the fee is proportioned to the amount of the authorized capital stock, which shall be deter- mined by the articles of incorporation, or amendments, or supple- mental articles, charter, declaration, report, or statement filed in your office. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, July 13, 1903. HON, CHARLES S. MOORE, State Treasurer: DEAR SIR: Replying to yours of the 8th instant relative to whether estates valued at less than ten thousand dollars are subject to the inheritance tax, passed by the last legislature, would say, pre- suming the act to be constitutional, but not having examined that question, I am of the opinion that estates valued at less than ten thousand dollars are not subject to the duty, or tax imposed by House Bill No. 41, session laws 1903, page 49. The first section prescribes the property subject to the tax; the second section prescribes the rate of tax, and prescribes where such inheritance, devise, bequest, etc., shall pass to or for the use or benefit of any father, mother, husband, wife, child, brother, sister, wife or widow of son, or the husband of a daughter, or any child or children adopted as such in conformity with the laws of Oregon, or to any person to whom the decedent, for not less than &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 169 road supervisor shall be, and then section 68 provides for their appointment in the following language: “The county courts of the different counties of this State at their regular term in Janu- ary, 1904, and annually thereafter shall appoint a road supervisor for each road district of their respective counties, who shall be a resident of the district for which he shall be appointed, and shall hold his office for the term of one year, and until his successor is appointed and qualified.&amp;quot; The section covers everything contained in House Bill No. 80, and differs in this, the bill reads: &amp;quot;At the general election in 1904, and every two years thereafter, there shall be elected in each election precinct in this State a road super- visor for each road district, etc.,” and provides for a term of two years. Said section 68 reads: “The county courts of the different counties of this State at their first regular term in January, 1904. and annually thereafter, shall appoint a road supervisor for each road district of their respective counties,&amp;quot; and provides a one-year term. The former provides for the election of the road super- visers by the people and a term of two years, and the latter for their appointment by the county court, and a term of one year. The two laws are in irreconcilable conflict, and both can not stand; and while I have no doubt it was the intention of the legislature to provide for the election of road supervisors by the people, when we undertake to apply the well-settled rules of construction to the two statutes, the latter must prevail and the former is repealed by implication. Judge Bean says, in State v. Rogers, 22 Or. 359, “A subsequent affirmative statute does not repeal a prior one unless there is a conflict between the two which is direct and irreconcila- ble. But where such conflict dees exist and the conflict can not be reconciled under the rules of statutory construction the subsequent statute, being the later expression of the legislature on the sub- ject, must be considered in force, and to operate as a repeal by im- plication of all former acts or parts of acts in conflict therewith.&amp;quot; This is the rule that our courts have held in a long line of decisions, both before and since the one above quoted. It is also well settled that a legislature has the power to change the term of office after it is filled. Kenedy x&apos;. Pyle, 1 Or. 149. Everding v.

I see no reason why a grac!- uate of Yale, or Harvard, or any other college or university can not be employed. If they hold the certificates or diplomas re- quired by said section they can be employed, in my opinion, with- out further examination. Section 8 on page 41 of school laws of 1903 applies to public or common schools only, and not to teachers in high schools. As to special grade teachers, such as teach drawing, music, or sloyd, I see no reason why they should not be examined by the regular exemining board of districts of the first class and receive a special certificate from such board to teach their specialty in said district. Every teacher must qualify under some law. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, March 9, 1904. IIon Geo. E. CHAMBERLAIN, Governor of Oregon: DER SIR: Relative to your inquiry of the 7th instant request- ing my opinion as to whether road supervisors elected in 1902 will hold office imtil the election in 1904, or whether their terms expired in January, 1904, and if the latter proposition is true, were the county courts required to appoint road supervisors at the January term of court, 1904, and if so how long do these appointees hold, permit me to say that in an opinion rendered to the Secretary of State, April 22, 1903, I gave it as my opinion that section 4824, B. &amp;amp; C. Code as amended by House Bill No. 80, laws of 1903, page 19. was repealed by implication by House Bill No. 280, page 10, laws of 1903. House Bill No. 80 was approved by the Governor February 10, 1903. and provides for the election of road supervisors in the road districts of the State, and prescribes their terms of office, etc. No. 280 was approved by the Governor February 24, 1903, and filed in the office of the Secretary of State the same day, and is the later act. It is a general law relating to the roads and highways of the State, and in several sections sets forth what the duties of the &quot; &quot;6 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. be negotiated and sold according to the provisions of subdivision 6 or subdivision 31 of section 3389 of Bellinger and Cotton&apos;s Anno- tated Codes and Statutes of Oregon.&amp;quot; The section is intended to facilitate the sale of school bonds, but the same in no way accomplishes that object, and if it should be held by the courts that such a vote is a condition precedent to the power to vote bonds, and must be taken prior to voting bonds, then in all those cases where bonds have been voted without first voting upon those two subdivisions, the courts might hold the bonds to be illegally issued, therefore it would greatly strengthen that class of securi- ties if said section were repealed, and all bonds issued declared valid, whether such vote was taken or not prior to the vote au- thorizing the issuance of the same. LEWIS AND CLARK EXPOSITION. At the regular session of 1903, the legislative assembly enacted House Bill No. 1, providing for the holding of an exhibition of arts, industries, manufactures, and the products of the rivers, soil, mines, forests and sea, and to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the exploration of the Oregon Country by Captains Meri- wether Lewis and William Clark, to be held at Portland, Ore- gon, in 1905, and providing for the appointment of a commission to carry into effect the object of the act appropriating the sum of $500,000 therefor. This office has frequently advised the commission relative to the construction of said act, and their authority thereunder, some of which opinions are hereinafter contained. In addition to advis- ing the commission as aforesaid, this office in March, 1904, ex- amined, advised corrections, and approved contracts, specifica- tions and bonds for constructing buildings for said exposition as follows, to wit: Building, Contractor&apos;s name.

This is a suit to foreclose a mortgage by the plaintiff upon the property of the defendant Barbara Wilson, and upon which the State was supposed also to have a mortgage, and therefore was made a party defendant. On investigation it was found that the State&apos;s mortgage did not cover this land, and consequently the State had no interest. Accordingly a disclaimer was filed on the part of the State. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR. No. 41. In the matter of the appeal of the STATE OF OREGON from the decision of the Honorable Commissioner of the General Land Office, by letter &amp;quot;N&amp;quot; of April 15, 1903, To the HONORABLE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR. This matter arose from the action of the State, taken at the suggestion of intending purchasers, in selecting land in lieu of secticus 16 and 36, which were claimed by said intending pur- &quot; &apos;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 93 I am inclined to the opinion that the board at a regular meeting could make an estimate of the amount required for the coming quarter, but there is no question, in my opinion, that at the end of the quarter, when the requisition is made for a certain amount for current expenses for that quarter within the purview of the act, the Secretary of State has no discretion in the matter, and that it then becomes his duty to draw the warrant on the Treasurer for the amount required, and that he has no authority to demand an itemized account, or any further evidence or information concern- ing the expenditure. I have hesitated to give an opinion in this matter, as I found two opinions of my distinguished predecessor not strictly in harmony herewith, the first rendered June 19, 1901, and the latter April 30, 1902, in which he holds that the Secretary of State must audit the claims, and then draw a warrant in payment of the same, and in which he says to the Secretary of State, “In other words you pursue with reference to the appropriation for the Agricultura! College, the same plan as to auditing and paying of bills which your department has adopted with regard to the allowance and payment of bills out of appropriations made for the use and benefit of other educational institutions.&quot; I find on careful reading of said two opinions that they were based on the assumption that the Agri- cultural College stood in the same relation to the State as the nor- mal schools, State Insane Asylum, etc., but in that he was in error. They are all managed by trustees called boards, who have their management and custody, and which boards and trustees are mere- ly agents of the State, managing State property, and paying out State funds, while the college is a quasi municipal corporation, the same as a school district, and managing its own property, and paying out its own funds. It makes no difference if the funds are donated by the State, no conditions or obligations go with it, ex- cept these provided in the act, or necessarily implied. Had the fact that the college was a corporation been called to the attention of my predecessor, I have no doubt his opinion would have coin- cided with this. He argues in his last opinion cited, that if a war- rant is drawn quarterly in favor of the treasurer of the college for the full fourth of the fund, no balance would remain in the hands of the State Treasurer to be carried over to the next year, and added to the fund of that year. That is of course correct, and &apos; &apos;164 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. under the general incorporation laws of the State of Oregon, of the Lewis and Clark Centennial and American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair, the corporation mentioned in the act, with a capital stock of $500,000. In and by its articles of incorporation, on file in the office of the Secretary of State, its purpose and business is declared to be, amongst other things, &quot;to hold an American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair and an exhibition of the arts, in- dustries, manufactures and products of the soil, mines, and sea, in the City of Portland, Oregon, during the year 1905, to be state, inter-state, national. American, and Oriental in its character.&quot; Before the bill for the act in question was introduced in the legis- lature, the corporation was fully organized, with the late ex- Senator Henry W. Corbett as its president, and a number of the most prominent citizens of the Northwest as its directors, nearly all of its capital stock had been subscribed for and payments there- on had been made by the subscribers thereto, a site for the expo- sition had been selected and procured, and the plan and scope of the exposition decided upon by said corporation. The scope and plan of the exposition so launched and undertaken by said corporation was to be such as to enlist the co-operation an! support of all the States and Territories, especially those west of the Mississippi River, and secure the active and direct recognition and aid of our General Government, and the participation of Ori- ental countries, as the event to be celebrated was to be both national and international in its character. The bill for the act in question was prepared by the legislative committee of the board of directors of said corporation and was introduced in the legis- lature by a member from the City of Portland, who was and is general counsel for said corporation, and the bill so prepared and introduced was passed without amendment by the almost unani- mous vote of the legislature. The facts stated in the foregoing brief review are notoriously known by the people generally of this State. In my opinion, it was the purpose and intention of the legislature by this act, to recognize and indorse the exposition so planned and undertaken by said corporation and to aid it with an appropriation of $500,000 for its participation therein, and not in any sense to embark the State of Oregon in the enterprise of holding, or conducting, or supervising an exposition. While article 1 of the act declares it to be the purpose and in- &apos; &apos;86 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, April 30, 1903. MESSRS. WILLIAMS, WOOD &amp;amp; LINTHICUM, Portland, Oregon: GENTLEMEN: Replying to yours of the 1st instant, relative to my opinion concerning so-called “advisory appointments,&quot; I must apologize for not answering at an earlier date, but have been so busy I could not examine the matter before. While I have great respect for your opinion, and have carefully considered the matter, I cannot divest myself of the impression that the contracts or agreements in question are a mere subter- fuge to avoid the statute, and so believing, I can not assist by my opinion unless the law is such that it must be construed in that manner. The argument used in your letter that the cashier, bookkeeper, and local attorney do not pay a license fee, seems to me not in point; their duties are entirely different, and they re- ceive fixed salaries for prescribed duties, while the advisory agent aids and assists the person who solicits and writes up the insurance. by giving him the names of persons who would be good risks, and who would be liable to insure, and procuring and giving informa- ticn as to persons attempting in any way to defraud the company, and influencing his friends to carry a certain amount of insurance in the company, or to carry the same himself; and to influence those who have policies to pay the premiums thereon, and to aid and as- sist generally in maintaining the insurance business written by the manager, and are to receive compensation in proportion to the beneficial results. These duties are usually performed by per- sons who solicit and write insurance, and there is nothing in the agreement to relieve the advisor from writing the insurance, leav- ing the only things not his duty to do to be that he need not per- sonally solicit insurance, or collect the premiums; all the rest he must do, and must accomplish results by way of increase of poli- cies and insurance for the company. While the contract is with the manager, it is approved by the company, by its president, or some officer whose duty it is to approve the same, and it is com- pany funds which are set aside to pay the advisory agents; and all their work tends to benefit the company, and all business to be done under the contract is company business, and it would be im- possible for the manager to carry out the conditions of the con- tract without the consent of the company, and the contract shows &apos; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 55 volunteers for service during the Indian Wars of 1855 and 1856, goes into effect, and whether the same applies to widows and or. phans of deceased volunteers who served in said wars, received. Section 5 of the act reads as follows: “Whereas the Territory of Oregon, by act of the legislature, passed on the 24th day of January, 1856, promised to pay the volunteers serving in the said Indian Wars, the same compensation above set forth, and said Territory, nor the State of Oregon has ever paid for said services, and many of the said volunteers have died without even their losses in said wars being compensated, an emergency exists, and this act shall be and remain in full force and effect from and after its approval by the Governor.&amp;quot; An examination of the bill shows that it passed the House the 18th ultimo, the Senate on the 20th, and on the 24th it was filed in the office of the Secretary of State without the Governor&apos;s signature. Section 15 of article 5 of the constitution of Oregon provides : &amp;quot;If any bill shall not be returned by the Governor within five days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, it shall be a law without his signature, unless the general adjourn- ment shall prevent its return, in which case it shall be a law, un- less the Governor within five days next after the adjournment (Sundays excepted) shall file such bill with his objections thereto in the office of the Secretary of State, who shall lay the same be- fore the legislative assembly at its next session in like manner as if it had been returned by the Governor.” The Governor having filed the bill without approving or disap- proving the same, and within five days after the legislative assem- bly adjourned, unless it comes within some of the exceptions de- clared in the constitution, it becomes a law within ninety days after the adjournment of the session. Section 28 of article 4 of the constitution of the State of Ore- gon provides that, “No act shall take effect until ninety days from the end of the session at which the same shall have been passed, except in case of emergency; which emergency shall be de- clared in the preamble or in the body of the law,&amp;quot; and section 1 of said article 4, as amended, provides, inter alia, “The second power reserved by the people is the referendum, and it may be ordered (except as to laws necessary for the immediate preservation of the publie peace, health, or safety) either by petition signed by five &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 35 chasers and others to be mineral in character, and therefore not inuring to the State for the support of schools under the act ad- mitting the Territory of Oregon as a State. The United States Land Department denied the selections on various grounds, prin- cipally for the reason that the proofs of the mineral character of said sections 16 and 36 were not sufficient to class them as mineral lands, and that a large proportion of said sections had been sold to third parties by the State prior to the attempt to adjudicate them as mineral lands, and that the State should not be allowed to impeach its own title, after having sold the lands. The matter having been appealed from the decision of the Com- missioner of the General Land Office to the Secretary of the In- terior, January 26, 1904, the Honorable Secretary of the Interior handed down his decision affirming the decision of the Commis. sioner of the General Land Office and against the contentions of the State. On March 8, 1904, the State moved for a review of the case, and notified all the land offices in the State of such action. On September 12, 1904, notice was received from the United States Land Office at Lakeview, Oregon, that under date of August 23, 1904, the Acting Commissioner of the General Land Office had advised that under date of August 16, 1904, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior denied the motion for review, and the case was accordingly closed. General W. H. Odell, as special counsel, had charge of this mat- ter for the State when I entered upon the discharge of the duties of Attorney-General. I assisted him in moving for a review, and in making a brief, but am free to confess that at the time of so doing I had very serious doubts as to the right or justice of the State&apos;s contentions. The result compels the State to refund the money received from intending purchasers, but under the construc- tion given to sections 3310 and 3311 of Bellinger and Cotton&apos;s Compilation by this office, opinion hereinafter set forth, it is not obliged to pay interest on the major part of such moneys. &quot; &quot;100 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. fee provided for the succeeding fraction of the fiscal year, and each fee is graded according to the amount of capital stock. Therefore, when a certificate of increase of the capital stock is filed, there must be a license fee paid on the increase, the same as is required upon the formation of a new corporation, and must pay the annual license fee as provided in section 5, from the date of such increase to the end of the fiscal year. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 4, 1903. MR. IR, WADE, County Clerk of Lincoln County, Toledo, Oregon: DEAR SIR: Replying to yours of the 3rd instant, just received, requesting my opinion as to the proper course to pursue in cases where the judges of election, after properly canvassing the votes, and inclosing the ballots and tally sheets in sealed envelopes, have, instead of returning them separately to the county clerk, as re- quired by law, placed the tally sheets and poll books in the box with the ballots, and then sealed the box, and so returned them to the clerk; I am of the opinion that you should, on the day you have the two justices with you to make the canvass, apply to the county judge for an order to open the boxes from those precincts where the tally sheets and poll books have been returned sealed up in the boxes, and having secured such order, bring the boxes before the canvassing board, and in the presence of the board and county judge open the boxes, remove the tally sheets and poll books, but not disturb the ballots, and then relock and reseal the boxes care- fully, and care for them the same as though they had not been opened. This, I think, is the only course you can pursue in the matter, unless you make the application to the judge of the circuit court, but section 2785 of B. &amp;amp; C&apos;s Code seems to concede that the county court has the authority to order the boxes opened when needed for the next election, and I am of the opinion that the county court can direct them to be opened for the purpose of securing the tally sheets and poll books, which have been inadvertantly placed &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 85 is only one other matter in which the two acts differ, the former reads, “And the said county courts, when they appoint a road master or masters, shall pay said officer or officers a salary suffi- cient to justify a competent person or persons to devote his or their whole time to the matter of roads and bridges from March 1st to December 1st, of each year.&apos;? While the latter act says the couty court shall pay said officer a salary sufficient to justify a competent person or persons to devote his or their whole time, or as inuch thereof as the county court may deem necessary, to the matter of roads and bridges. If the court requires the whole time to be devoted the court must pay accordingly, while the former says the court must pay a sum large enough to compensate for his whole time from the 1st of March to December 1st, in each year, but does not prevent the county court from employing the road master all the time if deemed best. The greater includes the less, and I am of the opinion that under the rules before mentioned, there is no irreconcilable conflict between the two acts, they being in all other respects indentical, except the former prescribes the duties more fully, and therefore House Bill No. 251 should appear in your compilation of road laws. The question as to whether the road supervisors now serving in the road districts throughout the State will hold until their successors are appointed at the January, 1904, sessions of the respective county courts, I have given but little attention, but am of the opinion they so hold. They were duly elected to serve for two years, or until their successors shall be elected and qualified. While the law reads “or” instead of &amp;quot;and,&amp;quot; I am inclined to think that it means until his successor is elected and qualified, but if it does not, their terms would not ex- pire until June. 1904, as they were elected June, 1902, for two years, if no longer. The 1903 law provides for the appointment of road supervisors at the January, 1904, term of the respective county courts, and repeals the former laws upon the subject. It does not, however, abolish the office, but when the old law dies the new one takes effect, and the office of road supervisor exists right along, and the person lawfully performing the duties there- of under the old law continues to do so under the new law until by operation of the new law his successor is appointed and quali.. fieci.

On the 26th day of May, 1903, the District Attorney of the Fourth Judicial District filed an information in the circuit court for Multnomah County, charging the defendant with the crime of murder in the first degree, in that on the 24th day of May, 1904, he killed one F. H. Drews by shooting him with a revolver. And thereafter he was regularly arraigned thereunder and tried and found guilty of murder in the second degree, and sentenced to imprisonment in the penitentiary for life. Thereupon the defend- ant appealed, and the case is now pending in the Supreme Court. No. 25. STATE OF OREGON, } Appellant, V. H. L. BRIGGS, Respondent, On the 21st day of October, 1903, the respondent, H. L. Briggs, was informed against in the municipal court of the City of Port- land, County of Multnomah, and State of Oregon, by the district attorney for the Fourth Judicial District for unlawfully conduct- ing a barber school, without first having obtained a license, and without sanction of the State Board of Barber Examiners. He was tried and convicted before the municipal court, and duly ap- pealed to the circuit court for Multnomah County. A trial was duly had upon such appeal on January 6, 1904, and the respondent was again convicted as charged. After conviction, and before judgment, the respondent filed a motion for an order to arrest judgment, for the reason that manifest error appeared in the record, to wit: That the facts stated in the complaint did not constitute a crime, and because no judgment against him can law- &quot; &apos;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 67 The rule is laid down in 21 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law 2nd Ed. page 889, that “Persons contracting as officers or directors of a corporation which has not yet been legally organized, as where a certificate of organization has not yet been filed, or the pre- scribed amount of stock has not been subscribed, or when for other reasons the organization of the corporation is not complete, and the corporation has therefore no legal existence, are personally liable on such contracts, although they may have contracted in good faith, believing that they had the power to contract for and hind the corporation,&quot; and the doctrine is supported by cases cited in the states of California, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kan- sas, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Vermont, et al. Your commission is not. strictly speaking, a corporation, but I am of the opinion that it must be governed by the same rules, and it cannot be legally organized until the preseribed time has elapsed, and that the members thereof entering into contracts on its behalf prior thereto, having full knowledge of its legal status, will be personally liable on such contracts, and that although the contracts may be ratified, it will not relieve the personal liability unless the creditor consents to the ratification and agrees to look to the commission only for compensation. For the reasons above set forth, I do not think the commission can incur any liabilities on behalf of the State until it shall be legally organized. I am unable to see how the commission can lawfully transact any business until after the act shall be in effect, except to con- fer together and lay out plans to be followed out when it has the power. It is also well to bear in mind the fact that the bill con- tains no emergency clause, and may yet be referred to the people, and in such event may be acted upon by them adversely, in which case there would be no opportunity for ratification. I fully real- ize the importance of early action relative to the fair, and would like further time to consider the propositions you submitted. However, in the light of the authorities. I have had time to examine, I am of the opinion that if the bill is not referred to the people, the commission would have the power of ratification, and that members thereof entering into contracts with third parties would be personally liable thereon, and that ratification without the con- sent and co-operation of the creditor, would not transfer the lia- &apos; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 19 of State, to audit plaintiff&apos;s claim, and draw a warrant therefor. Defendant appealed from this decision of the circuit court, and on February 4, 1904, the case was heard in the Supreme Court, and Jarch 1, 1904, the decision was handed down, reversing the decision of the lower court, and holding in accordance with the claims of defendant&apos;s counsel.

Upon trial duly had, the defendant was found guilty as charged, June 4, 1903, and on July 9, 1903, was sentenced to the penitentiary for the period of two years and six months. Defendant appealed, and on June 13, 1904, said appeal was dis- missed on motion of the Attorney-General, for the reason that the defendant failed to make or file brief, and abandoned his appeal.

DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR Sir: Yours of the 2nd instant, by Mr. Wrightman, ask- ing whether national banks, organized and doing business under and by virtue of the laws of the United States, are liable to make the statements, and pay the fee prescribed by the act of the State Legislature, approved February 16, 1903, has my consideration. I am of the opinion that national banks are not subject to the provisions of said act; such banks are wholly under the manage- ment and control of the United States Laws, except when a State is given permission to exercise control, and the states can exercise no greater or other control than is granted them by the United States Statutes. That is the doctrine laid down in 7 Federal, 269, and many other authorities. Permission never having been given to the State of Oregon to tax national banks, except as to their capital stock under section 5210 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, the Legislature of Oregon can in no manner license or tax national banks.

DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR Sir: Relative to the payment to the Agricuitural College of the amount appropriated by the statute under act of February 6, 1901, to which you have called my attention, I would say, that &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 41 the legislature has the right to so declare, and to provide for the abatement of the same. 1 Wood on Nuisances, sections 3, 69, 71, and 110, and cases cited. As a city extends, such nuisances should be removed to vacant grounds, and if they will not remove willingly, they can be com- pelled to do so. Relative to the second question as to the manner of abatement of the nuisance, the manner provided in the bill differs but little from the general mode prescribed by sections 344, 345, and 346 of Bellinger and Cotton&apos;s Codes, and I fail to see why the same is not proper and sufficient. I am of the opinion that it is or will become the duty of the sheriff of the county, under section 1017 of B. &amp;amp; C. Codes to execute any warrants which may be issued to abate a nuisance under the provisions of the act, although it might be well to so state. I would suggest that section 4, which will be section 3, when the bill is numbered, might be better to read &apos;adjudged guilty of establishing or maintaining such nuisance,&amp;quot; instead of “adjudged guilty of such nuisance.” The defendant may be guilty of es- tablishing or maintaining, not of being a nuisance. However, that was not referred to me, and I merely suggest the change for your consideration, and respectfully submit that, in my opinion, the provisions of said bill do not interfere, at least in an unlawful manner, with any vested rights. No person has a right to so conduct himself er to so use his property as to render the lives of the public unsafe, and the manner of abatement is proper and sufficient. I herewith return said bill.

State Land Board, Salem, Oregon: GENTLEMEN: Relative to your request of the 9th instant for my opinion in the matter of the offer of Emma Fitzgerald for com- promise of the suit pending relative to the Philip Foster mort- gage, I find the facts to be that: September 8, 1878–State Land Board loaned Philip Foster and wife $350 at ten per cent. interest, secured by a mortgage on 231.35 acres of land in Clacka- mas County, Oregon. December 3, 1886– Decree of foreclosure and sale rendered and entered in circuit court for said county. &quot; &quot;122 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. acquired by deed or foreclosure of mortgage, shall be sold by the State Land Board to the first legal applicant at $2.50 per acre.&amp;quot; the last clause being the one under consideration. It does not refer to indemnity school land, and is not necessarily connected there- with. The first three sections of the act deal with the indemnity school lands, and are full and complete within themselves, provid- ing for the selection thereof, terms and manner of sale, and the price. Section 4 of the act deals with sections 16 and 36, which may be hereafter surveyed, and all school land now surveyed, and owned by the State, except those acquired by deed or mortgage foreclosure. It does not refer to indemnity lands in any particu- lar, and there is nothing in the title of the act which would give notice that the act contained a purpose to sell all school lands now surveyed at $2.50 per acre. The act is limited by its title to the acquisition and sale of indemnity school lands, and to that class of lands only, and the class referred to, as well as the balance of said section 4 is not germane to the title, and hence not within the pur- view of the same, and is included in the act contrary to the pro- visions of section 20 of article 4 of the Oregon Constitution, which section of the constitution was intended to prevent fraud in legis- lation by inserting in the body of the act matter wholly foreign and disconnected from the subject expressed in the title. This construction is sustained by the decisions of our Supreme Court, a few of which I will cite. Simen v. Northur, 27 Or. 505. Lowrey t&apos;. Sterling, 41 Or. 518. Therefore I am of the opinion that section 4 of the act mentioned, which section contains the clause specially referred to, is uncon- stitutional, and that the board is not required to sell land at $2.50 per acre under the terms of said section. I am also of the opinion that under the provisions of sections 3300 and 3301 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. and section 1 of the act of 1899, page 94, which Attorney-General Blackburn holds is still in force, the board has the authority to sell State land at their true value. and for not less than $1.25 per acre, and that under those provi- sions the duty of the board is to determine the true value prior to the sale. &quot; &quot;78 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 2 the passage of the act, to wit: February 16, 1903, within which to file the declaration and pay the fees as provided in section 7; said section 8 also provides what corporations are exempt from paying the fifty dollars. Also every such foreign corporation or company must comply with the requirement of section 6, and duly execute and acknowl- elge a power of attorney, appointing some qualified person as its attorney in fact, which power of attorney must be recorded in the office of the Secretary of State, and such foreign corporations and companies, whether or not heretofore lawfully transacting busi- ness in this state, are not by the terms of section 8 exempt from making and recording such power of attorney. The necessity of having an attorney in fact, upon whom service of papers can be lawfully made, is just as great in one case as the other, and it is evident from all the provisions of the act that the legislature in- tended that all foreign corporations and companies mentioned in the act should have a resident attorney in fact, to represent them in legal proceedings. The only difference the act makes between those corporations and companies not heretofore lawfully engaged in business in this State, and those heretofore lawfully transacting business in the State, is that the latter have six months in which to comply with the act, and may be excused from accompanying the declaration with certified copy of charter, but as to the charter, I think it would be better to require the copy, although I was of the impression on my first examination of the matter that it was not required, and am still of such opinion if the act be strictly construed. Neither can the authority of the legislature to impose such terms and conditions upon foreign corporations desiring to do busi- ness in this State, as it may deem best, be denied. Clark and Marshall on Corporations, section 837, say: “A corporation must dwell in the place of its creation, and cannot migrate to another sovereignty. It can never become a citizen or resident of another State or country, but may transact business by its agent in an- other State or country, if such other State or country does not pro- hibit it from so doing.” In the case of the Bank of Augusta v. Earle, Field J. says: “The recognition of its existence even by other states and the enforcement of its contracts made therein, depend purely upon the comity of those States, a comity which is ܕ ܕ &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 181 OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, May 7, 1904. Hon. G. G. BROWN, Clerk of State Land Board: DEAR SIR: Relative to yours of the 27th ultimo, requesting my opinion on behalf of the board, as to whether money should be re- paid on certificates of sale covering lands to which the title of the State has failed, where the parties have allowed the payments to lapse for more than three years and the certificates subject to can- cellation, and whether under the law a certificate upon which pay- ments are delinquent for more than three years is not absolutely void; permit me to say that sections 3306 and 3307 of B. &amp;amp; C. Com- pilation provides that where any installment of the principal or interest on the purchase price of lands remains unpaid for over one year the sale and certificate shall be void and all payments made thereon shall be forfeited and the land shall be subject to sale as if it had not before been sold. Granting that the act is constitutional, it cuts off the person who is delinquent one year, and forfeits all his payments, and the cer- tificate he holds is, by virtue of the act, of no force or effect and aðsolutely void. The question then narrows down to whether the holder of a void certificate is entitled to repayment, for the reason that the title of the State to the land originally applied for fails. If the applicant became a delinquent purchaser, and his certificate, under the sections above cited, void, prior to the failure of the State&apos;s title. I am of the opinion that he is not entitled to repay- ment. In that case his certificate and payments under it would be forfeited and void if the title of the State had not failed, and I think subsequent failure of the State&apos;s title would not remove forfeiture already incurred. However, where the applicant stopped paying because the State&apos;s title had failed, it would, in my opinion, excuse the non-payment, and no forfeiture would result, and the applicant would be en- titled to repayment.; Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &quot;46 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. ple that what is implied in a statute is as much a part of the statute as if it were expressed in direct terms, it must be con- ceded that the Territorial Printer was required to publish a newspaper. These same two provisions became a part of the laws of the State of Oregon when she became a State in 1859, and are referred to in similar terms in acts relating to the duties of the State Printer, whereas the provision relating to estrays has never been directly repealed and still appears in our laws substantially as enacted in 1833. But in the case of the newspaper, it is enacted in the laws of 1859, page 23, that the State Printer be required to publish the public acts of each session, as they are signed by the Governor, in some newspaper, at the seat of government. And the provision is changed again in 1870 so that this section is amended to read * * In some newspaper of general circulation in the State of Oregon. After 1870 no mention of this provision is made in the numer- ous acts and amendments defining the duties of the State Printer, and I am of the opinion that the provision requiring the State Printer to publish the public acts, etc., is thus repealed by impli- cation, or at least was rendered obsolete and of no force or effect. Though the law relating to estrays and the publication of the notice in the State Printer&apos;s paper has never been directly re- pealed, still, since the provision requiring the State Printer to publish a newspaper has become inoperative and obsolete, and the State Printer is not now required to publish a paper, it is re- pealed by implication so far and so much thereof is void and of no effect whatever. The query naturally presents itself as to the mode of procedure in regard to estrays of the value of over $15. Since those of that value alone were to be published in the State Printer&apos;s paper, and since there is no such paper, as we have seen, it follows that one should proceed as if this section did not appear at all, the same being void, and I am of the opinion that there would be no differ- ence in the manner of procedure between estrays of over the value of $15 and those under.

CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 17 + Colwell was heard by the Supreme Court at Pendleton, November 3, 1903, and on December 21st the decision of the court was handed down reversing the judgment of the lower court, and remanding the case for a new trial.

Charles Nickel et al. defendants, in the circuit court of Jackson county, in which the State Land Board is made a party defendant, permit me to say that the board has no interest in the matter, unless the lands covered by the Rostel mort- gage should sell for more than enough to satisfy his mortgage; then the board would have a right to the surplus, as it holds a de- ficiency judgment against Charles Nickel, taken at the time the mortgage held by the board against Charles Nickel was foreclosed. None of the Rostel lands were mortgaged to the State Land Board. Relative to the taxes on the Nickel lands, I have just received a letter from Hon. W. I. Vawter, who has been negotiating with the county court of Jackson County for a long time, with the re. sult that the county court will settle for $500, while they claim about $1,300.

ACKERMAN, Superintendent of Public Instruction: DEAR SIR: Replying to your inquiry of recent date as to the legality of the board of education adding manual training to their course of study for the Portland public schools, permit me to say that I find nothing in the school law which seems prohibitory, and subdivision 3 of section 3408, B. &amp;amp; C. Code, Vol. 2, page 1170, provides that it is the duty of the board in districts of the first- class “To prescribe courses of study and make rules and regula- tions for the government of said district.&quot; This certainly makes it the duty of the board to prescribe the course of study, and the members of the board must exercise their judgment as to what they include therein, and if they consider it beneficial for the pu- pils and for the best interest of the community, I am of the opinion that they can include manual training in the course of study. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, May 26, 1904. Hon. F. I. DUNBAR. Secretary of State: DEAR Sir: I have carefully examined the voucher approved by the State Board of Health, covering the claim of G. G. Gam- mans, trustee, for rental of Unitarian Chapel, and the corre- spondence between your office and the board relative to the same, handed me with your communication of the 13th instant, and while the question as to whether the board is authorized to incur that expense is doubtful, I am inclined to the opinion that it is better to audit the claim. The State Health Office says the board called the meeting as a special meeting of the board, and as I gather from the papers, the meeting was for the purpose of consulting as to the best methods of collecting “information concerning vital sta- tisties, knowledge respecting diseases, and all useful information on the subject of hygiene, and through an annual report, and otherwise as the board may direct, to disseminate such informa- tion among the people,&quot; as required by section 5 of Senate &apos; &quot;116 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. the Abiqua Land Company, and while the same is in the main cor- rect, I do not see why your honorable body should grant them a hearing upon the matter. I may have been a little slow in my in- vestigation, but the matter is one of considerable importance, and should be examined carefully. That evidence is obtained from people, and called ex parte statements by the company&apos;s counsel, does not render those statements incompetent. The facts above recited are competent evidence to show that Mr. Puter fraudulently procured those certificates of purchase from the board, and are in my opinion sufficient to set them aside, if held by the original purchasers, or any one receiving title with knowledge of the fraud. As to whether the knowle:Ige of the secretary and attorney of the company of the fraud, it having been received by them as afore- said, is sufficient notice to the corporation, is a question I have been examining, and have come to the conclusion that was at least sufficient to put them on inquiry, and that being the case, they are bound by all the information they could have obtained by making such an investigation as a reasonable, prudent man should have made under the circumstances. One other question I have partially examined, is whether the proceedings had before the board hereinbefore referred to, would estop the board from maintaining a suit to recover the land, and while I can not say what a court will hold in the matter, I am of the opinion that the board is not estopped. The decision of the board as to the applications represented by Mr. Puter, was based on his testimony, which is shown to have been false, as far as the fictitious names were concerned, and therefore could not be binding. The false testimony was part of the fraud. While I can not say the board would be assured of a victory, it has, in my opinion at least, an even show to win. From the best evidence I can obtain, the land in question is worth at least ten dollars per acre. Awaiting your further instructions, I am, Very respectfully yours, A. M.

MOORE, State Treasurer: DEAR SIR: Relative to the application of School District No. 1. of Clatsop County, to borrow $7,000, in addition to the $35,000 al- ready loaned to said district, without holding another meeting of the legal voters of the district to vote the additional loan, I am of the opinion that you have the right to accept their bonds for that sum, without such meeting. When the meeting was calleil, the petition duly signed by the requisite number of legal voting tax- payers requested that the board of directors submit to the voters the question of contracting a bonded indebtedness in the sum of $35.000, and not exceed $75,000 for the purpose of refunding the bonded indebtedness of indebtedness of said district. The call, or notice, posted in pursuance of said petition by order of the board, submitted the question of &quot;contracting a bonded debt of said district for the purpose of refunding the present bonded! indebtedness of the district as the same becomes due, or as much thereof as may be taken up prior to maturity,&quot; and then sets forth the particular indebtedness to be refunded, amounting in the ag- gregate to $75,000. The petition was in the sum of $35,000, and not to exceed $75,000. The notice calling the meeting specifies the particular indebtedness to be refunded, amounting to $75,000, the meeting voted to refund. The directors have refunded $35,000 by placing bonds with you, under the act authorizing you to loan to school districts. If the money requested, $7,000, is to be used! in refunding some more of the particular indebtedness voted to be &apos; &quot; &quot; &apos;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 89 such doctrine, and I can see no reason for claiming it. Persons performing services for the State must have their claims audited and allowed by the proper auditing officer, who is the Secretary of State, and should he disallow a claim, and the claim is not liqui- dated, the only remedy is to refer it to the legislative assembly; if it is liquidated by the law itself, like the salaries of public officers, a writ of mandamus can be sued out against the Secretary to com- pel him to draw a warrant on the Treasurer for the amount due under the law. But a claimant against a municipal corporation must have his claim audited by the proper officers of the corpora- tion. Should it be disallowed, his remedy is by action against the corporation, and if he recovers judgment, it must be paid in the manner provided by law, and it is the corporation, and not the State that must pay, and out of its own funds provided by law for that purpose. The Secretary of State can not audit and pay a claim of the corporation out of the general, or any other fund, of the State, for the reason that they are not obligations against the State. &quot;I think it is evident from the foregoing that the college is a municipal corporation, and must pay its own bills out of funds provided by law for that purpose. The next question is, have any funds been provided, and it must be answered in the affirmative. Section 9 of the act approved February 11, 1885, session laws, page 12, provides, “For the en- dowment, maintenance, and support of said: Agricultural College, there is hereby set apart and appropriated the interest on the fund which has arisen, and which will hereafter arise from the sale of all lands granted to the State of Oregon, or to which said State was entitled under the act of Congress, to provide colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanical arts to the several States and Territories, approved July 2, 1862, and the acts amendatory thereof, or so much thereof as may be necessary,&quot; and then pro- vides that such interest shall be used only in payment of the sala- ries of professors, officers, and other current expenses. This is a continuing fund, and is applicable for the purposes for which it is provided each year. Section 2 of the act of 1901, session laws. page 13, provides for the annual support and benefit of the State Agricultural College, which shall be levied and collected in the same manner as other taxes for State purposes are levied and col- lected, the sum of $25,000, and that said sum shall be paid into &apos; &quot;[5] State v.

An examination of the appropriation bills from the date of the creation of this office will disclose that there has been appropriated for attorneys&apos; fees almost twice as much as the appropriation for salary for this department during the same time. This was made necessary to properly guard the state&apos;s interests in matters beyond the jurisdiction of this department. The reports of the clerk of the board of commissioners for the investment of the irreducible school fund shows that there have been more than 300 foreclosures of mortgages by that department during the past 4 years, and that the state has acquired title to, and now has under its control, nearly 300 farms distributed through the different counties of this state. Legal services are necessary to the proper care and protection of large property interests of this nature, with this depart- ment as the legal adviser of the board, which it is at the pres. ent time, and the additional duties of examining the title of all lands offered as security for loans, and the supervision and direction of the foreclosures of the mortgages, the state would be protected in its title upon the loans and the property acquired upon foreclosure, the board would be brought in direct touch with the details, as well as the condition generally of affairs so necessary to a proper management and investment of nearly $2,500,000 now comprising this fund. This would necessitate the appointment of a deputy to assist in carrying into proper effect these new duties, but the fees received by the 32 agents of the board, scattered throughout the different counties of the state, for the examination of titles, and those paid to attorneys on the foreclosure proceedings, would, of themselves, more than pay the extra expense entailed by a deputy, a reasonable amount could be fixed by the board for the examination of the title, to be paid by the applicant, which is customary in all transactions of this character. Let this, together with the fee, which is always included in the note or money obligation when foreclosure becomes necessary, be turned into the state fund. These alone would more than be sufficient to pay all the in- creased expense, besides obviating the necessity of the special appropriations for attorney fees, which have been largely in excess of the appropriation for the salary of this office, and would constantly keep the condition of affairs before the board. I would further recommend that the district attorneys of the state make either annual or biennial reports to this depart- ment, stating in detail, and from each county report the num- ber of indictments returned by the grand jury, stating the &quot; &quot;152 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, January 16, 1904. Hox. 0. P. HOFF, Labor Commissioner: DEAR SIR: Relative to yours of the 7th instant as to whether it would be a violation of the labor law of 1903 to allow women to work ten hours and fifteen minutes each working day, except Sat- urdays, and on Saturdays work only eight hours and forty-five minutes, making an average of ten hours each day, permit me to say that I am of the opinion that it would be a violation of the statute. Section 1 of the act provides that no female shall be employed more than ten hours during any day; and section 3 provides that they shall not be permitted to work more than ten hours in any one day. The statute can not be added to, taken from, or amended by construction. The language of the statute regulating the hours of employment of women is so plain that but one con- struction can be given it, and that is, if females work, or are per- mitted to work, more than ten hours in any one day in any shop or factory, it is violation of the act. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. 署​落 ​OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, January 27, 1904. HON GEO. M. BROWN, District Attorney, Second Judicial District, Roseburg, Oregon: DEAR SIR: Relative to your request for my opinion as to whether under sections 3067 and 3068 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. a president or other officer of a bank can be fined for not furnishing a list of the bank depositors to the assessor of the county in which the bank is lo- cated, permit me to say that in the case of the First National Bank of Youngstown 1. Hughes, et al. 6 Fed. Rep. 737, the court held that “A national bank may be compelled to disclose the names of its depositors, and the amounts of their deposits, under the com- pulsory process of a state court, in order to ascertain whether any money deposited therein, subject to taxation within the county, has &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 179 duction of $5,000 provided in section 2. I do not know the amount of the estate, but will assume it to be $35,000. The widow re- ceives the use of all except a few dollars devised prior. I am there. fore of the opinion that the matter should be adjusted on the fol- lowing basis: Value of the estate, $35,000, or whatever the same is inventoried ; deduct legacies, and funeral, and other expenses and debts; then take four per cent. of the balance, which I assume to be $30,000, which is $1,200. Then if the widow is 60 years old, the present value of one dollar of her annuity of $1,200 per year is $9.41474, and multiplying this present value of one dollar by 1,200 makes the total value of the widow&apos;s life estate $12,297.69. From this sum deduct the $5,000 under section 2 of the act and we have $7,397.69 in excess of said $5,000, and the sum upon which the widow must pay tax at the rate of one per cent. as provided in said section 2, making her tax $73.98. Under the will, at the death of the widow, the property reverts to the heirs, seven in number, and they must pay tax on any amount they will receive above $5,000 each. If the estate is $30,- 000, as above estimated, then the value of the same at the death of the widow, she being 60 years of age, as above stated, is shown by the table to be $0.59943 on the dollar, and multiplying this by 30,- 000 gives $17,982.90, the sum upon which tax accrues or would accrue if all went to one party, and tax would have to be paid on the same, less $5,000, but it being divided among seven heirs, no one receives what at the present is $5,000 in value, and there- fore no tax is payable except by the widow, or on her interest. The result will be the same, in my opinion, if the widow remarries, as a division of two-thirds of the estate among seven heirs would only give each two twenty-firsts of the estate, which woud not be of the value of $5,000 net.

It was not the intention of the legislature to reward a man for his own negligence. The plea of applicant that he could not reclaim the land without reclaiming some to which the State never acquired title, is without merit, as that to which the title failed appears to be upland, and must have been known to appli- cant when he made his application to purchase, and it could not have prevented reclamation of that which was swamp. Also the townships are some ten or twelve miles apart, and Tp. 7 N. of R. 9 W. is inland, and in no way connected with the other two. As I view the facts, and numerous acts of the legislature, and the law as it now reads, I am of the opinion that the applicant is entitled to repayment of the purchase money paid, but not to interest thereon. It appears that there was no legal objection to his having pos- session of the land, and he can not remain away, refuse to reclaim and pay the balance due until the State has sold to some one else, and then come in and demand interest from date of payment.

BROWN, Clerk of State Land Board: • DEAR SIR: Relative to yours of the 24th instant whether in my opinion “A person who has purchased from the State indemnity school land and has divested it of its timber, and where the State is unable to convey title, is entitled to repayment of the purchase price paid to the State,&apos;&apos; permit me to say that in my opinion he is. Sections 3310 and 3311 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. provide for the repay- ment when title fails, and the State is unable to give title. The indemnity was selected by the State at the request of the pur- chaser, and the base having failed, he cannot get title from the State. The land selected as indemnity was vacant government land when selected, and under the United States laws no timber should have been removed until title was recovered from the United States. The purchaser having removed the timber from the land while the title was in the United States, must answer to the owner of the fee for the same when called upon. It follows that the State must settle with its customers the same as though no timber had been removed, unless the United States can hold the State liable, and I can see no way in which that can be done.

Legislature being in session, time to file the same was extended to March 30, 1903, on which date the petition was filed.

The three corporations tendering the conveyance, before men- tiened, claim to darrein title through mesne conveyances from the criginal grantee, and could acquire no greater rights or privileges than were had and enjoyed by said original grantee, unless other rights have been acquired, and I have been unable to find that such is the case. It is evident from the language of the grant above referred to that the State of Oregon did not grant to the Willamette Woolen Manufacturing Company the right to divert the water from Mill Creek after it had been once turned in from the Santiam River, except as might be necessary to apply it to the purposes of the grant. It was intended to increase the flow of water in Mill Creek, and the hydraulic power in proportion, and the said corporation in payment for doing the work, paying all expenses and damages, was given the hydraulic power thus created to use, sell, or lease. No title to the water and no right to divert it from Mill Creek was conveyed. Such, at least, is my opinion of the original grant, and it does not appear that the same has since been changed. If the three corporations tendering the conveyance have no right in themselves to divert water from Mill Creek, it follows, ex vi termini, that they can convey no such right. The only real effect that their conveyance would have, would be to estop them from complaining if the State should divert not to exceed 1,200,000 gal- lons of water per day. If the corporations tendering the conveyance have succeeded to all the rights granted to the Willamette Woolen Manufacturing Company, by the State, then, under the conveyance, the State could not be interrupted in its use of 1,200,000 gallons of water per day, unless such use interfered with the rights of riparian owners, and as to that I have no information as to whether there are any riparian rights to be interfered with. &apos; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 43 come of telephone: telegraph. railroad, and similar corporations of one and one-half per cent., or in lieu thereof pay the sum of $600 per annum to the State Treasurer, permit me to say that I have given the matter as much consideration as I have had time, but would like to go into the matter more thoroughly. However, I am of the opinion that when you tax a railroad company on its gross earn- ings, you are imposing a tax on the property which produces the gross earnings, measured by the amount of such earnings. The property which produces the gross or net earnings is the right of way, track, stations, etc., with the franchises. The Supreme Court of this State, in the Jackson County case, has decided that all of these things, together with the net income, should be consid- ered in assessing a railroad company, and when the net income was a certain sum, other conditions being as stated in the opinion in the case, the net income per mile should be capitalized at five per cent., and that taken as the valuation of the roadbed for the purposes of taxation. Now I am of the opinion that you cannot tax a railroad corporation or street railway upon its gross or net earnings and also impose a tax on the value of the roadbed as shown by its net earnings. The proposed tax on gross earnings purports to be a tax on the franchise, but it takes both the fran- chise and plant to make a railway that can be taxed on the value as shown by its net earnings, which is the present method of tax- ing them, and if this assessment should be made, and a railroad company should be assessed in some county: higher than they thought they should be, they would contend that the plant could only be assessed at its value as ordinary real estate, which would bring their right of way, roadbed and track down to about $100 per mile, or the same as agricultural lands, its earning capacity: which is now considered to bring the assesment up to about $5,000 per mile, having been already taxed under the proposed law. 1 am of the opinion that the safe way is to cut out the railroads and include in your bill telegraph, telephone and other corporations which have a large income and but little tangible property. Ex- press companies should, I think, also be included. I am also of the opinion that the tax should be a certain per cent. on the gross earninys, and then it will be equal and uniform. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &quot;166 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, February 23, 1904. HON. CHARLES S. MOORE, State Treasurer: DEAR Sir: Relative to whether the form of mortgage in the case of Otis Arnold and Walter Marion Arnold by their guardian, W. J. Furnish, and Hazel Dupuis and her husband for a loan of $4,000 of school fund is sufficient in law, permit me to suggest the following changes, to wit: On the first page, change the word “ago” to “prior, as having died a few years ago might be true, and still the husband have sur- vived the wife, while the evident fact is that the husband died first, and changing that one word will make the mortgage say so. I do not think it essential that the petition be copied into the mortgage, but am of the opinion that the petition must state the purpose for which the loan is desired, which purpose must also be recited in the order. The probate court must find from the peti- tion that the loan is necessary for the maintenance and support of the ward and his family, or the care of the ward&apos;s property. B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. Sec. 5276. Guardians have no power to mortgage the estate of their wards without the order of a court under a statute conferring jurisdiction upon the court, and our statute restricts the court from authorizing a sale or mortgage of a ward&apos;s property by the guardian, except for the purpose above mentioned. There- fore the court must, from the petition, find the facts necessary to give it jurisdiction and recite the findings in the order. The order must contain a statement of the objects to which the avails of the mortgage are to be applied, and cannot refer to any other paper for such specification. It must be the judgment of the court that the facts exist. Therefore the order of the court should be amended accordingly. Otherwise I think the form of the mortgage is sufficient. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 177 ܕܕ . Ira W. Berry, of Milton, Umatilla County, Oregon, for Dairy and Food Commissioner is sufficient under the law, and should be filed by you and the names of the nominees be placed on the official bal- lot. They were, as the certificate of nomination shows, each nomi- nated by an assembly of more than one hundred legally-qualified voters of the State of Oregon, members of the Prohibition party, and said certificate contains all that is required by section 2794 of B. &amp;amp; C. Compilation, page 938, to wit: 1st, the name of the candi- date; 2nd, the name of the office for which he is nominated; 3rd, the party he represents; 4th, his place of residence. The words “of the State of Oregon&apos; following &apos;Prohibition party” only show in what State said party belongs and is acting, and also in what State said electors assembled. They are not a part of the name, and said certificate can not, in my opinion, be so con- strued. The statute prescribes no form for the certificate, but only the facts it shall contain. Neither is the fact that both nominees are certified in one certificate objectionable. Section 2792 of B. &amp;amp; C. Compilation, page 937, provides that &amp;quot;Every such certificate of nomination made by such * * assembly may contain the name of one candidate for each office to be filled,” therefore I am of the opinion that all nominations made by one assembly of electors can be certitfied in one certificate, if it contains all the information required by law for each candidate. The certificate of nomination for the other offices above named is not, in my opinion, sufficient to warrant you in filing the same, or certifying the names for placing on the official ballot. Each nomination was, as shown by the certificate, made by an assembly of electors of the State of Oregon, and therefore of the whole State, while under sections 2791 and 2798 of B. &amp;amp; C. Compilation it is plain to my mind that each candidate must be nominated by an as- sembly of at least one hundred electors assembled from the dis- trict in which the nominee of the assembly is to be voted for. Electors from the First Congressional District can not vote for a nominee in the Second District, nor vice versch. and there is nothing in the certificate last mentioned which shows that the persons therein named were nominated by the electors having the right to nominate them. The State assembly can not, in my opinion, nomi- nate other than for the State offices. You have, in my opinion, not only the right, but it is your duty Att&apos;y Gen. -12 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 33 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE STATE OF OREGON, FOR WASCO COUNTY.

This case was commenced by the State under the act of the leg. islature creating the Board of Commissioners of Canals and Locks, passed at the special session of 1903, and filed in the office of the Secretary of State December 24, 1903, authorizing the said board to secure the right of way for the United States canal around the obstructions in the Columbia River between The Dalles and Celilo, either by purchase or condemnation. The Board of Commission- ers and the defendants having been unable to agree as to all par- ticulars of a grant by the defendant, the Oregon Railroad &amp;amp; Navi- gation Company, a condemnation proceeding was commenced in the circuit court for Wasco County, and the defendants having answered, admitting the complaint, judgment was entered con- demning the right of way sought by the said board for the State of Oregon, and awarding to the defendants the sum of $22,837 as damages therefor. Att&apos;y Gen. -3 &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 129 Bellinger and Cotton&apos;s Codes and Statutes of Oregon, which pro- vides that fraternal orders, naming a number of them, “And also all fraternal orders and societies that are associated or incorporated for the primary purpose of mutual protection and relief of its members, other than such protection and relief as may be afforded by insurance, may grant relief, etc.,&apos;&apos; without complying with the insurance laws of this State. The legislature of this State has provided for the distribution of the funds of benevolent societies among their members for the purpose of sick benefits and funeral expenses, and the fact that the association under consideration pays the burial expenses to the undertaker, instead of the family of the deceased, makes it no less a benevolent and charitable association, and in my opinion is plainly outside of the purview of the insurance laws of this State, and is not within the scope of their restrictive and supervisory pro- visions, and is not subject to the prohibition of such laws so long as it confines its agreements to the payment of burial expenses.

Giltner, urging pay- ment thereof. You refuse to audit the claim and draw a warrant for its pay- ment for the reason that in your opinion it does not appear to be the character of expense which the act provides shall be paid from the appropriation; and you ask my opinion as to whether &amp;quot;Ex- penses may be incurred by the commission, and paid from the ap- Att&apos;y Gen. -9 &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 65 organization, without the members thereof assuming a personal responsibility, or in some way making the State responsible for their acts, before the bill goes into effect, received. , Section 2 of the act creating your commission recites that the members of the commission shall be appointed by the Governor within ten days after the passage of the act, and I understand that has been done, therefore the personnel of your commission is known, and no authority is vested in the Executive to remove at pleasure, or to change the membership, unless it might be for cause, after due examination. The commission is, therefore, in existence, but with no authority to enter upon the duties for which it was cre- ate:I until May 21, 1903, the date the act goes into effect. I can see no reason why a provisional organization can not be effected, but it will have to be expressly ratified by the commis- sion after it has been notified by the Secretary of State under sec- tion 3 of the act, and re-organized in accordance therewith. As to what the commission may do before the act takes effect, depends upon what they can ratify afterwards, and if they all, or a majority of them, agree to ratification. The committees which the commission, provisionally organized, might appoint, would be agents of the provisional organization, and I am of the opinion that their acts could be ratified by the com- mission when legally organized after the act goes into effect. However, the committees must act for the commission, and in its behalf and only in regard to matters strictly within the provisions of the act creating the commission. Neither a member of the com- mission nor a committee appointed by the provisional organiza- tion can incur any indebtedness and then transfer it to the com- mission by ratification. Fellows v.

There is no question in my mind but that the appointment can be made, and it is certainly important that selections should be made when opportunity offers, as the public lands are growing less, but of course an agent can not work without compensation. Attorney-General Blackburn rendered an opinion that section 1 of the act of 1899 was still operative, and the Secretary&apos;s office has been conducted in accordance with that opiniori, and while comparing said opinion of Judge Bellinger&apos;s with the same, I am impressed with the logic of the latter, I shall not attempt to in any manner change Judge Blackburn&apos;s opinion; and that is the only official opinion until some court of competent jurisdiction de- cides adversely. Therefore, if an agent is appointed under the 1899 act, he will at least be a de facto officer, and his acts valid, and will be treated as an officer de jure, unless a court decision as above mentioned, should prevent. I have been unable to find any authorities on the question submitted, and can only give my construction of the statutes. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, April 2, 1903. HCN. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEJR SIR: Replying to your verbal inquiry as to whether the word declaration, as used in section 8 of the act “To provide for the licensing of domestic and foreign corporations, etc.,&amp;quot; being House Bill No. 2, found on page 39 et seq. of session laws of 1903, includes the certified copies of the articles of incorporation or charter, provided in section 7 for corporations “Not heretofore lawfully transacting business in the State,&amp;quot; I am or the opinion that it does not. Said section 7 defines exactly what the declaration shall con- tain, and then provides for those corporations which have not heretofore been lawfully transacting business in the State. Be- fore they can do so, they must also furnish, and the same must accompany the declaration, a certified copy of their articles of incorporation or charter. But the language used is, “And said &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 185 flicting with subdivision 3 of section 48 above mentioned. There- fore the director who has served the longest term as such under an election is chairman of the board. When a vacancy occurs in the office of director, and the remaining directors fill the same by ap- pointment, the appointee is serving by virtue of the appointment, and not by virtue of an election. Further, if elected to fill the vacancy, his service would com- mence from the date of his election. Therefore, in my opinion, the person appointed or elected to fill the vacancy acquires no rights or privileges by virtue of the service of his predecessor. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 4, 1904. HION. GEO. E. CHAMBERLAIN, Governor of Oregon: Sir: I have examined the question propounded in the let- ter of Mr. N. C. Dozier, handed me with yours of the 3rd instant, as to whether the heard of directors of a district of the second or third class can be authorized by a majority vote of the legal voters of the district to contract with one of the faculty of a norma! school, to wit: with the principal of the training department, to teach the district school, and then said principal send pupils of the normal school to do the teaching in the district school; and have the honor to report that in my opinion they have no such authority. The employment of teachers is one of the duties of the district school board. Subdivision 7 of section 48, school laws 1903, page 10. To be a teacher, one must have passed the examination pro- vided by law and be duly licensed to teach; must hold a certificate or permit, as provided by article 3 of school laws of 1903. Sub- division 2 of section 48, page 44 of said laws, provides that the board may authorize the drawing of warrants in payment of teachers&apos; salaries, “Provided that all teachers must hold legal cer- tificates, and that said certificates must the tire time of the teacher&apos;s service, and must specify all the branches taught, and such certificate can neither directly nor indirectly be made to legalize another teacher&apos;s services. If Cover en- &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 165 tention of the State of Oregon to hold an exhibition in the City of Portland in 1905, subsequent sections thereof, read in the light of the facts recited above, show that by this language it was only meant that the State should make an exhibition of its products and resources at the exposition, which was to be held and conducted by said corporation along the lines it had previously decided upon, and not that the State should undertake or assume the manage- ment, or control, or supervision of that or any other exposition. The act distinctly recognizes the corporation and the exposition referred to in the act is clearly the exposition so planned and un- dertaken by said corporation. All powers of initiative and con- trol in connection with the exposition, as such, must necessarily be vested in said corporation, and there is nothing in the act, as I view it, that divests said corporation or imposes upon the State any such powers. The commission created by the act is practically a disbursing agency of the State to see that the money appro- priated is actually and honestly used and expended in connection with said exposition of said corporation in the manner and for the purposes stated in the act, the State having chosen, in making this appropriation for the exhibition at and participation in said expo- sition, to point out and define the manner and extent in and to which it should so exhibit and participate. If any disagreement or controversy between said commission and said corporation is referred to you, your action and decision therein should be simply with a view to seeing that no moneys appropriated by the act are used or disbursed for any other purposes, or in any other manner than therein indicated. There is nothing in the act that confers upen the State of Oregon, or upon any of its officers or agents, any power or authority to in any way control or conduct the exposi- tion to be held by said corporation, at which exposition the State is, umder the terms of the act, to make an exhibition of its products and resources in the way provided therein. Your&apos;s very truly, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &quot;104 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. tion comes within some of these exceptions, it is subject to the an- nual license fee; there is no question but that it does not come within the latter class of exceptions above mentioned. The business of the corporation as set forth in its articles of incorporation, is to hold a fair and exposition of the arts, indus- tries, manufactures, and products of the soil, mines, and sea, in the City of Portland, in the year 1905; and it is fully authorized under its articles for such purpose, to buy land, erect buildings, borrow money, receive subscriptions, accept donations of taxes, and otherwise receive money and funds for the objects of the as- sociation, and, in fact, to transact any and all business necessary and proper for carrying on the purposes of the corporation. When said fair shall be ready, they have power and authority to charge a fee to the public for visiting the same, aiso to charge tradesmen, merchants, and others, fees for transacting business within the fair grounds, and the money received from these vari- ous sources, after paying the expenses of the fair, would belong to the corporation; and the corporation also, as I view the law and its charter, can sell all its property at the close of the fair, and if the proceeds are more than enough to pay the indebtedness of the corporation, the profits will all belong to the company. It certainly is not for a literary, religious, or charitable purpose, and I do not think it was created for a scientific or educational purpose, within the meaning of the exceptions; churches, schools, and the like having evidently been in the legislative mind when those exceptions were being considered. Therefore I am of the opinion that the Oriental Fair Corporation must pay the annual license fee provided by the act of 1903. I herewith return Mr. Reed&apos;s letter. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 10, 1903. HION. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Relative to the question presented by Mr. F. Mc- Kercher, secretary of the Equitable Savings and Loan Association, &quot; &quot;44 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. . OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, February 19, 1903. MR. A. W. HIEPNER, Union, Oregon: DEAR SIR: Section 975 of Hill&apos;s Annotated Laws of Oregon imposes the duty upon the district attorney to institute the pro- ceedings before magistrates for the arrest of a person charged with, or reasonably suspected of public offenses, when he has in- formation that such offense has been committed, etc. But the dis- trict attorney cannot be compelled to act upon the bare assertions or statements of any one who cares to make them. If an informer wishes to charge a person with some designated crime, the district attorney may require the former to make his complaint under oath, before some magistrate, as provided in sections 1546 and 1547 of Hill&apos;s Annotated Laws of Oregon, before he is compelled to take up the prosecution. A considerable discretion is left to the examining magistrate, and upon the examination of the in- former and other witnesses, it is left to him to decide whether the crime complained of has been committed. Sections 1519 and 1550. If the magistrate wrongfully and willfully refuses to issue a warrant of arrest, the proper course would be to mandamus him, or proceed against him for malfeasance in office. Section 1852. These are the general provisions of our law in regard to arrests and malfeasance in office. In regard to the specific sections to which you refer me, I would respectfully submit that it is the duty , of the officers mentioned in section 3532 to inform against and prosecute all persons whom they shall have reasonable cause to be- lieve guilty of violating the provisions of the act. If the said officers know of their own knowledge that the provisions of the act are being violated, and you can prove that they know it, which is sometimes difficult, they can be punished as provided in the act, or mandamused to do their duty or proceeded against for malfeas- ance in office. It would not, in my opinion, e sufficient to call the officers&apos; attention to the fact that gambling was going on. The witnesses must be able to prove it, and if they appear before a magistrate and swear of their own knowledge to the fact of the gambling, the officers must proceed or be liable to prosecution. Of course, if it can be proved that the officer you mention was &quot; &quot;[ 10 ] State v. Alpha Kniyhten. An appeal by defendant from a conviction for rape. Appeal from Josephine County.

At the request of state and county oflicers, this office has prepared and rendered one hundred and thirty-two opinions, consisting of more than two thousand folios :- For the Superintendent of Public Instruction—Thirty opin- ions. Speaker of House of Representatives—Three opinions. Clerk of State Land Board-Six opinions. Secretary of State-Forty-six opinions. Governor of State-Eight opinions. For other officers, in all-Thirty-nine opinions. In addition to the written opinions which have been deliv- ed, verbal or oral opinions without number have been given to different officers. Within the last two years the business of this office has in- creased at least four-fold, and without the clerical assistance which was granted by the legislature at its regular session in 1899 could not have been attended to. It will therefore be necessary that an appropriation be again made for clerical assistance, and it will be wholly unnecessary to add any ad- ditional duties unless additional help is also given, for the time of the Attorney-General is now fully occupied. If the legislative assembly, in its wisdom and exercise of its best judgment, should deem it proper to grant additional aid, the office of Assistant Attorney-General should be created, with such salary attached as would justify a reliable and responsi- &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 147 lay the same before the legislative assembly at its next session in like manner as if it had been returned by the Governor.&amp;quot; The next legislative assembly &apos;contemplated in the constitution, is, in my opinion, the next regular term thereof fixed by the terms of the instrument being construed. The constitution provides that a session of the legislative assembly shall be held biennially on the second Monday of September every second year, unless a different day shall have been appointed by law, to wit: an act of the legis- lative assembly. The Governor may by proclamation convene the legislature in special session whenever in his opinion an emergency exists de- manding the same. The framers of the constitution evidently did not have in mind such special sessions when they provided for lay- ing bills before the next session, and it has been universally held by the courts that when a law, constitutional or statutory, speaks of sessions or terms, the sessions or terms constituted by law are meant, not special terms, called by proclamation or appointed by the court. Therefore it is my opinion that the bills referred to in your com- munication should be laid before the next regular session to be held in January, 1905. Thompson v. Clackamas Co. 11 Or. 364.

The appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court September 17, 1900, for the reason that the Grand Jury had been dis- charged and, if the judgment of the lower court should be re- versed, the judgment of reversal could not be enforced. &quot; &apos;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 61 act takes effect immediately is correct, the second question be- comes immaterial, except as to claims which may have been filed before the act became a law, and as to that I would respectfully call your attention to the initiation of these claims under consider- ation. In 1856, Laws of Oregon, page 25, the Territory of Oregon passed an act authorizing the Governor to employ the full military force of the Territory, and to call for and accept the services of any number of volunteers, and declare a general war to exist at that time with the Indians, and section 4 of the act provides that privates should receive $2 per day, and the same for the use of horses, and commissioned officers should receive the same pay as officers of the same rank in the United States Army. No one can question the conclusion that when the Governor called out the men under said act, and they performed the services required, they were entitled to the compensation provided in the act, and the same was a debt due them from the Territory of Oregon. Section 7 of article 18 of the constitution provides that “All laws in force in the Territory of Oregon when this constitution takes effect and consistent therewith, shall continue in force until altered or repealed,” and section 10 of said article saves all exist- ing rights, and provides that “private rights shall not be effected by any such change.&quot; Therefore all the claims that the veterans &quot; had against the Territory of Oregon, they had against the State of Oregon, and I am of the opinion that those claims were valid claims against the Territory. Long before the United States Gov- ernment extended Territorial laws over the section of country em- braced in the boundaries of our State, (See Oregon Archives, page 33) the inhabitants established a government and formed a militia, passed military laws, and have ever since exercised that right, even to the payment of soldiers, and appropriating money for military purposes. Therefore the claim is in the nature of a debt due from the State of Oregon for services actually per- formed, and I am of the opinion that proof thereof can be made at any time, and that proofs made when the circumstances were fresh in the minds of the witnesses is competent to be received, and that proofs can be taken at any time before and after the act took effect. This is not a pension, neither is it a debt created by the act, but the payment of an indebtedness long past due. However, it seems to be intended in section 3 of the act that the Adjutant- &apos; &quot;212 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. fine of not less than $25 nor more than $100, or be imprisoned in the county jail not less than thirty days nor more than six months. Nothing is said about costs, and therefore no costs can be imposed as a penalty. No other punishment can be imposed than that pro- vided by statute. State v. Shepard, 13 Or. 398; ex parte McGee. 33 Or. 165. Therefore no imprisonment can be imposed for fail- ure to pay costs, and if defendant has no property there is no way to enforce the payment of the costs. The legislature when passing a statute is supposed to have in mind all laws in force bearing upon the subject matter under con- sideration, and therefore must have enacted the law under which this conviction was had intending the same to be construed in pari materia with section 2282 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. which was enacted in 1864 and has been in full force and effect ever since, and which provides that the costs shall first be paid out of any money paid into court upon a judgment in a criminal action in a justice&apos;s court, and the balance be paid to the county treasurer to be appropriated as provided by law. The fact that in the statute under consideration the money is to be paid to the State Treasurer, can not, in my opinion, make any difference. If it read to the county treasurer, there would be no doubt but that the justice could deduct his costs from the fine, and when the two statutes are read together and considered with the fact that it has always been the practice to deduct costs in those cases from the first money paid, where the law does not pro- vide the payment of the costs as a part of the punishment, and for the imprisonment of the defendant until fine and costs are both paid, I am of the opinion that the justice of the peace has the right to deduct his costs from the first money paid, and remit the balance to the State Treasurer. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &quot;124 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 66 2 be so operated. Further, such a construction would permit can- perymen to engage in buying, selling, packing, preserving, and dealing in salmon, fish, and sturgeon to any extent, and pay only for a canner&apos;s license, while those who do not own, or operate a cannery, would have to pay a license. The words “other than canners&apos;&apos; evidently was intended to exclude canners from the rat- ing in section 4, they having been rated in section 3, and there would be no possible ambiguity if the word “as” had been also used, making the language read “other than as canners,&amp;quot; and I am of the opinion that such was the meaning intended. While it may work a little hardship on a firm desiring to engage in several branches of the fishing business, and not operating them up to the limit of the law, nevertheless it is my opinion that for each new business opened up the license must be paid. As to your right to compromise, I find no law giving you that authority. You must be governed by the ratings of the act. While I have not had time to give this matter as thorough an examination as it deserves, the foregoing is supported by the cases of Rosenbaum v. City of Newbern, 118 N. C. 83, and Morris v.

The abstract shows that there are no taxes due and unpaid upon the premises, and no judgments which are a lien thereon Therefore the title is in W.J.Van Lunburgh, Jr., with two mortgages against the land amounting to $700 and interest, one being for $300 and the other for $100; and also whatever claim the Owyhee Ditch Company and its successors may have upon said land for irrigating rentals or in any other way, which does not appear from the abstract.

It is not necessary to register those voters who duly registered for the June election, but only those who did not register for that election. The section above referred to was in force without amendment until the June election, hence all who registered prior to that election are legally registered, and then the direct primary law was voted at the June election, and the proclamation of the Governor was issued on the 24th day of June, 1904, declaring the law to be in effect from that date. The amendment took effect at that time, and it provides that the registration books shall be open this fall from the 20th of September to the 20th of October, but those who are legally registered are not required to register, but these not registered for the June election should be registered. Yours truly, A. M. CRAWFORD. Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, August 29, 1904. HON. JEFFERSON MYERS, President of Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition Commission, Portland, Oregon: DEAR Sir: I have given some thought to the questions pro- pounded in yours of the 22nd instant, and have also talked with the Secretary of State regarding the same, and still am undecided. However, the terms of the act creating your commission are very broad, and must also, in my opinion, be given a liberal construction. The commission is, I believe, the sole judge of what buildings it erects, and the use of the same so long as they are for exposition purposes. Any buildings erected, however, will be the property of the State after the exposition closes. As to premiums, I notice that section 6 of the act provides that all premiums shall be awarded by the corporation, while section 5 provides that the commission is authorized to purchase or rent xhibits. The premiums should, in my opinion, be general, and would have to be awarded by the corporation. The commission is authorized to make exhibit of the products, etc., of Oregon, and not of other States or countries, and could not, in my opinion, &quot; &quot;52 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, March 2, 1903. Hon. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Relative to your inquiry as to when the act creating a board of trustees for the State Reform School, defining their authority, and purporting to change the name thereof, takes ef- fect, permit me to say that I have, with some trepidation, come to the conclusion that the act took effect from and after its ap- proval by the Governor, to wit: February 26, 1903. Section 28 of article 4 of our State constitution provides, “No act shall take effect until ninety days from the end of the session at which the same shall have been passed, except in case of emer- geney; which emergeney shall be declared in the preamble or in the body of the law.&amp;quot; And section 1 of article 4 as amended, pro- vides, with other matters, that, &amp;quot;The second power reserved by the people is the referendum, and it may be ordered (except as to laws necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace. health or safety either by petition signed by tive per cent. of the legal voters, or by the legislative assembly as other bills are en- acted.&amp;quot; And further provides that referendum petitions shall be filed with the Secretary of State not more than ninety days after the final adjournment of the session of the legisiative assem- bly which passed the bill on which the referendum is demanded. There is no claim that the legislative assembly passed any act referring the bill under consideration, and nothing in the bill indicates that the legislature intended to refer the same. Section 4 of the act declares an emergency, and reads as follows: “Inas- much as there is great dissatisfaction with the present name borne by the institution, and its usefulness for good is retarded thereby. an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this act shall be in full force and effect from and after its approval by the Governor,&apos; and it was so approved on the 26th ultimo. It matters but little what we think of the facts upon which the legislature declares an emergency. It is the exclusive judge of the sufficiency of the facts, and its judgment thereon is not review- able.

OswaLD WEST, State Land Agent: DEAR SIR: Relative to yours of 28th ultimo inclosing abstract of lot 1, block 2, North Salem, I find the lot was mortgaged to the State January 2, 1871, for $150 by Mary Ann White, who at that time had title, or soon after secured title thereto. On October 28, 1872, said Mary Ann White conveyed all her interest in the property to George B. Wagnon for $250. Said mortgage was af- terwards foreclosed and all the interest of said Mary Ann White at the date of the mortgage, and which she afterward acquired, which was the fee simple title, was afterwards sold by the sheriff to John E. Boynton in carrying out said decree of foreclosure for $273.43, which sale was afterwards duly confirmed. On January 12, 1877, the sheriff made a deed conveying said property to said John E. Boynton, the purchaser at said sale. The above-named George B. Wagnon, who had succeeded to the title of said Mary Ann White, was not made a party defendant in said foreclosure suit, and after said sheriff&apos;s deed was executed, to wit: on May 24, 1877, said George B. Wagnon conveyed his interest in said lot to D. H. Wagnon for the sum of $100, and on the 9th day of August, 1877, said D. H. Wagnon and wife conveyed their interest in said lot to Coleman Burnett, who in turn conveyed to Mrs. Annie M. McCormick for the sum of $75, and she is the present claimant. She claims in her affidavit that she has been in actual adverse pos- session of the lot ever since her purchase of Burnett in 1882. If that is true, then the title of the State is barred by the statute of limitations under the doctrine announced in Schneider v. Hutchin- son, 35 Or. 253, and the amendment of the statute, laws of 1903, page 18, eliminating the State from the operation of the statute of limitations, expressly provides that causes of action or suit already barred shall not be revived by virtue of the amendment. After the foreclosure, Wagnon, under whom Mrs. McCormick holds, held nothing but the equity of redemption, but if Wagnon&apos;s grantees have been in open, actual, notorious, and undisputed possession under the Wagnon deed, which on its face gave color of title for ten years prior to the law of 1903, the equity ripened into a legal title and the State is barred. If, however, the deed from Wagnon &quot; &quot;174 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, April 1, 1904. Hon. J. H. ACKERMAN, Superintendent of Public Instruction. DEAR SIR: Relative to your proposition as to whether the &amp;quot;use of Augsberg&apos;s drawing book in the hand of the teacher only, pupils using paper, would be a violation of the text book law of this state,&amp;quot; and also whether “there be any possible objection to the use of supplementary drawing from other sources than that now in use,&amp;quot; permit me to say that in my opinion neither can be permitted. Text books for our schools have been selected by a committee selected and appointed because of their supposed spe- cial knowledge of the kind of text books best adapted to the needs of the schools of this State; and to allow teachers who seem to think the commission has made a mistake in some book to substi- tute some other book or system would nullify the work of the com- mission and destroy the uniformity in text books intended by the law. Also to allow teachers to supplement the work by teaching some other system in addition to the system established by the commission, would have the same effect. It would to some extent confuse the minds of the pupils, and if teachers were given that much latitude, they could if they wished teach very little from the books selected by the commission, and put in most of the time on books of their own selection. The text books having been chosen by a commission chosen from the best educators of the State, it is fair to presume their judg- ment is as good as the judgment of one individual. However, that is not the real question. The text books are selected as the law directs and in pursuance thereof, and no other book can be sub- stituted except in the manner provided by statute, therefore both of your questions must, in my opinion, be answered in the affirma- tive. To allow the requests would permit teachers to violate the law, which would be objectionable. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 71 OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, March 19, 1903. Hon. J. H. ACKERMAN, Superintendent of Public Instruction: DEAR SIR: In yours of the 12th instant, you ask the following questions: In case a school board closes its school for three days in order to allow a teacher to attend a county institute, and such teacher attends the institute but twelve hours, is the teacher en- titled to three days&apos; wages for the time the school was closed? Subdivision 21 of section 19 of school laws of 1901, page 23, pro- vides, among other things, that any teacher who shall have closed his or her school for not more than three days in order to attend said institute shall not forfeit his or her wages as teacher during such time as he or she shall have been in attendance at said insti- tute, etc. When the language is used “shall not forfeit his or her wages during such time as he or she shall have been in attendance, etc., it is equivalent to saying that wages would be forfeited in case of non-attendance, and the fact that the county superintendent may revoke certificate makes no difference. If the county super- intendent had granted leave of absence, I think the teacher woull be entitled to wages for the three days. The law requires six- teen hours&apos; attendance during the three days, and I am of the opinion that the teacher is only entitled to pay for the time actually attended. The penalty is fixed for non-attendance, and the stat- ute says the teacher shall not forfeit wages during the time he or she shall have been in attendance. The teacher woud be entitled to pay for twelve hours only, or two days. As to whether the board of directors have authority to deduct $5 from the teacher&apos;s wages for not having attended an institute sixteen hours, for the reason that the district failed to have that amount apportioned because of such non-attendance of the teacher; I am of the opinion that the directors have no such right. The penalty for non-attendance is fixed by the law to be the loss of wages for the time not in attendance, and the county superinten- dent may, at his discretion, revoke the certificate, reduce the grade, or refuse to grant a certificate to any teacher who refuses to attend the county institute without cause. No one has a right to inflict any other penalty. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 113 cial fund is provided out of which expenses of conveying such persons thereto can be paid, it must be paid out of the appropria- tion made for the payment of the expenses of the transportation of convicts committed to the Oregon State Penitentiary.

Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, July 6, 1903. Hon. F. I. DUNBIR, Secretary of State: DEAR Sir: Relative to your inquiry of recent date as to whether a foreign corporation, which occasionally has a representative come into this State, solicit, and receive orders for goods, which orders are filled by the corporation by sending the goods from the State where it is domiciled into this State, must file the statement and pay the annual license fee prescribed by the act of 1903, permit me to say that I am of the opinion it does not. Section 5 of the act approved February 16, 1903, requires every corporation, foreign or domes- tic, now doing business in this State, or which may hereafter do busi- ness in this State, to pay an annual license fee, and if it fails to pay the same, it shall not be permitted to maintain any action, suit, or proceeding in the courts of this State, and must pay a fine of one hundred dollars. A foreign corporation selling goods in this State by sending out agents to take orders, and then filling the orders by shipping from outside of the State direct to the customers, is not doing business within the State within the meaning of the act under the rule laid down in the case of M. N. &amp;amp; M. Co. v. Gorton et al. 26 L. R. A. 135, holding that a“Foreign corporation which simply contracts to furnish milling machinery, and place it in a mill, without having any office or agency in the State, is not carry- ing on business in the State within the meaning of a statutory pro- hibition of carrying on business. It is an act of interstate com- . Att&apos;y Gen.--8 &quot; &apos;148 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 9 Section 3097 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. provides, among other things, that “All the taxes hereafter levied by any school district * * shall be levied upon the property therein respectively assessable upon the valuation of such property, as shown by the assessment roll in the county in which such school district * # is included.&quot; The act of 1903 (session laws of 1903, page 23) makes it the duty of each school district to notify, in writing, the clerk of the county court of the rate per cent. of the tax levy made on or before the first day of January, so that the individual tax can be computed, extended on the roll, and be collected at the same time the taxes for county purposes are collected. It is provided on page 74 of the session laws of 1903, for the transportation of pupils from one district to another, and the dis- triet school board is authorized to levy a tax when authorized by a majority vote of the legal voters present at any legally-called school meeting; and I have failed to find any law regulating the time of meeting. The only objection to voting a tax in June would be that the same would not be collected until the following April; (Code section 3106) but the vote is just as binding if taken in June as if made in December or other time. Section 7 of the act of 1903 (session laws of 1903, page 298) makes it the duty of school districts to notify the clerk of the county court of the rate per cent. of the tax levy on or before the first day of September, but that act not being in effect, does not concern us at this time. Relative to levying a tax a year or more in advance, would say that I am of the opinion that it is not warranted by law. Such power is not delegated to the respective counties, and the legisla- ture evidently did not intend to confer greater power on school districts than on counties. There must be an assessment each year, hence it follows that there must be a levy each year on that assess- ment; and a levy can not be made on the assessment of any other year. State v. Y. J. S. Co. 14 Nev. 220, 2247. Town of Lebanon v. Ohio &amp;amp; Miss. Ry. Co. 77 Ill. 539, 512. In the case of Nason v. Whitney, 1 Pick. (Mass.) it was held that a parish could not in one year grant money, and assess it upon one valuation for the taxes of more than one year. &apos; &quot;172 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. September 20, 1890— Land sold on decree and bid in by board for State for $809.30. November 9, 1890--Sale duly confirmed. December 14, 1901- Board on representation of said Emma Fitz- gerald that the records of Clackamas County showed mortgage not foreclosed and same was outlawed, executed a satisfaction of same for the sum of $200 paid by said Emma Fitzgerald or her agent. April 21, 1903-Sheriff issued deed on said foreclosure sale to the board for the State. 1904–Suit commenced against Emma Fitzgerald to quiet title. March 9, 1904-Defendant offers $100 for a deed and compromise of suit. I presume you desire my opinion as to the law governing the case, and will first see in what position the State stands. The State Land Board is authorized to loan the irreducible school fund of the State upon unincumbered real property of not less than three times the amount of the loan in value, and in case the borrower fails to pay the interest or repay the loan, the board must foreclese the mortgage and collect the amount due. If there is no other buyer the board must bid in the property. B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. Sec. 3320 and 3321. I am unable to find any statute author- izing the board to accept any sun less than the original amount and cancel a mortgage. Such act is ultra vires, and void. 26 Wend. 191; 60 S. C. 465; 22 Vev. 417; 49 W. V. 453; and many other cases can be cited. The board is only the agent of the State in the matter and the State can not be estopped by the unauthorized acts of its officers. 9 Wheaton, 735; 60 S. C. 165; 42 Ark. 118; 55 Mich. 446; 61 Ala. 281; et al. Neither can state boards, officers, or other agents ratify their own illegal acts.

As to lands held up, we do not understand what you mean by “held up,” but if for any reason final receipt does not issue, whether by reason of contest or on the initiative of some special agent, I doubt the wisdom of assessing. No final receipt has is- sued and there is a definite charge that the applicant has not com- plied with the law, and if he has not, he is not entitled to patent, and no title either legal or equitable would be in him; but if he has fully complied so that final receipt issues, the land is assessable.

Brown, Clerk of State Land Board: DEAR SIR: Replying to yours of the 3rd instant relative to matter contained in letter of Mr. W. W. Burns, inclosed in your communication and herewith returned, permit me to say that without knowing all the facts it is hard to say whether a man who places improvements on State land prior to its being surveyed, intending to buy the land when surveyed and on the market, and failing to get the land, another party securing the State&apos;s title, has the right to remove the improvements. The Supreme Court of our State has held in 20 Or. page 522, “That the true criterion of an irremovable fixture consists in the united application of several tests: “First, real or constructive annexation of the article in question to the realty.” In the case you propose, no information is fur- nished as to what the improvements are, whether buildings, fences, clearings, plowing, or what. If of buildings, the annexation would of course be real, as they would be affixed to the soil, but of course if constructed in the usual manner of such structures on govern- ment land could be removed without injury to the realty. “Second, appropriation or adaptation to the use or purpose of that part of the realty with which it is connected.” If a building such as a dwelling, then this test would not apply, but if a mill of some kind was on the property, and the improvement consists of &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 49 1 The corporations tendering the conveyance claim to have suc- ceeded to all the rights of the Willamette Woolen Manufacturing Company, but they do not so guarantee in their said conveyance. I wish to particularly call your attention to the language used in said conveyance, on page 5 thereof, reading “and that the tak- ing or diversion of such water from said Mill Creek shall be made on the lands now belonging to the State of Oregon, on which is located the State Penitentiary, and being the same lands at which said State is authorized to take from Mill Creek such a quantity of water as it can pump through a pipe two inches in diameter, etc.&apos;&apos; I am not acquainted with the location and conditions surround- ing the same, and am unable to judge whether the point of diver- sion is correct or not. Otherwise I am of the opinion that the conveyance is sufficient to convey all the rights and privileges that the three corporations have in 1,200,000 gallons per day. As to whether other parties are interested, I am unable to say, and can not do so unless I am furnished with an abstract of title, Very respectfully submitted, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. ! OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, February 27, 1903. Hon. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Referring to the articles of agreement of the Provi- dent Savings Life Assurance Society of New York, and of the State Life Insurance Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, handed me for examination as to whether persons appointed as advisers there- under, are agents respectively of said companies, I am of the opinion that they are such agents and should take out the license required by section 4 of the act entitled “An act to license and regulate Life and Casualty Companies and Societies,&amp;quot; (Session laws of 1891, page 169) and for the following reasons : The act of 1887, page 118 of the session laws of that year, ap- points the Secretary of State Insurance Commissioner, and regu. lates the insurance business of this State, both fire and life. The same was amended in some particulars in 1889, but not to affect the Att&apos;y Gen.-4 &quot; &quot;58 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. with an emergency clause, as provided by section 28. This prin- ciple of construction is maintained in the case of State v. Bacon, 14 S. D. at page 403, and further that such was the intention of the legislature in submitting the amendment, and of the people in adopting it, is manifest from the fact that no amendment was made to section 28. Such view is further strengthened by the fact that the referendum applies only to laws not in force. It reads: “Any measure referred to the people shall take effect and become a law when it is approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon, and not otherwise.” Also referendum petitions must be filed with the Secretary of State not more than ninety days after adjournment of the legislative assembly which passed the bill, and that is the same number of days which must elapse after ad- journment of the legislature before a law can go into effect under said section 28, unless an emergency is declared in the preamble or body of the act. The amendment to section 1 was made to harmonize, in that respect, with the provisions of section 28, and the legislature must have had the latter section in mind when acting on the former. We might also with very good grace claim that the legislative and executive branches of our State Government have so construed the sections for the reason that many of the laws passed by the re- cently-adjourned legislative assembly were passed with an emer- gency clause, declaring that they should be in force and effect from and after their approval by the Governor, and they received Executive approval. We have now to consider whether the emergency clause, section 5 of the bill hereinbefore cited, is sufficient under said section 28 of the constitution, and upon that question we have for guidance, decisions of our Supreme Court, as well as of other States. In McWhirter v. Brainard, 5 Or. 426, the rule is laid down that the legislature cannot create an emergency, but may declare that ex- isting facts create one, and the same has since been followed in this State. In Biggs u. McBride, 17 Or. 647, the court say that legislative determination that certain facts constitute an emergency is not reviewable, and the same doctrine is stipported in Carpenter 1. Montgomery, 7 Blackf. 415; Hendrickson 1. Hendrickson, 7 Ind. 13; Mark 1. State, 14 Ind. 98; and many other authorities from &quot; &quot;[ 11 ] ble young attorney in accepting the position; and the power of appointment of assistant and stenographer should be vested in the Governor or Attorney-General. A suit in equity was instituted in the Circuit Court for Marion County by the Salem Flouring Mill Company v. W. P. Lord et al., to restrain the state officers from using or divert- ing from the ditch running from the Santiam River to Salem any greater amount of water than that to which it is claimed the state is entitled by virtue of a contract entered into with the vendors of said mill company. The issues have been made up, the testimony taken, and this cause is now under advisement, and an opinion and decree will in all probability be rendered before the meeting of the legislature. A few opinions have been written since the first part of this report was prepared and placed in the hands of the printer. On motion &apos;of the Attorney-General, many of the criminal cases which have been brought by appeal to the Supreme Court have been transferred to the trial docket of said court, advanced for hearing, and tried out of their regular order, to the end that if the judgments were affirmed, they might be enforced more speedily, and if such judgments were reversed, and the cases remanded, the parties might be retried without unnecessary delay and while the evidence might be procured. Attorney-General Idleman, in his last biennial report, made the following recommendation : “I would further recom- mend that the District Attorneys of the state make either an- nual or biennial reports to this department, stating in detail, and from each county report the number of indictments re- turned by the Grand Jury, stating the crime charged, the number of convictions, the penalty inflicted, the amount of acquittals, the fines collected, and the costs and expenses at- tendant upon the enforcement and execution of the law in each county of the state. And recommended, further, that a summary of these reports be included in the biennial report from this office. In these reports of the District Attorneys should now be in- cluded the number of informations filed by such District At- torneys, the crime charged in each, etc., and these reports should be made to this office quarterly, instead of annually or biennially. Such reports would be a source of valuable information to the Executive, as well as to the legislative department of the state. &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 151 &amp;gt; OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, January 16, 1904. Hon. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Relative to the claim of J. J. Fitzgerald for $300 under section 2386 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. for the arrest and conviction of one Guy Harshman, for having been engaged in attempting to rob passengers on Train No. 6 of the Oregon Railroad &amp;amp; Naviga- tion Company, on Wednesday, September 23, 1903, at mile post 21, between Corbett and Troutdale, in Multnomah County, Oregon, and the application of J. J. Fitzgerald and C. A. Risbell, for re- ward of $300 under said section, for the arrest and conviction of Chas. Hoehn, for having been engaged with the said Guy Harsh- man in said attempted hold-up and robbery, permit me to say that the statute provides such reward &amp;quot;For the arrest and conviction of each person robbing, or attempting to rob, any person upon, or having charge in whole or in part, any stage coach, wagon, rail- road train, or other conveyance engaged in carrying passengers, etc.&apos;&apos; The evidence shows that each of the defendants was guilty of the crime mentioned in said section, and that they attempted to hold up said passenger train and rob the same, and the passen- gers and employes thereon; and that they were each convicted of the crime of assault with a dangerous weapon, for the reason that the statute does not specifically describe a punishment for an at- tempt to hold up and rob a railroad train. I do not think the failure of the statute to provide a penalty for the particular crime, although it might be a technical excuse, should be held to prevent the officers who made the arrest and secured the conviction of the defendants, from receiving the reward pro- vided by said statute, and proclamation of the Governor. The statute is intended to encourage officers and other persons in hunt- ing for and arresting desperate criminals of that class, and while the evidence shows that they have actually performed the work provided in the statute, I think it conducive to justice and good order that the same be liberally construed, and therefore advise that the claim be paid.

It would be inequitable to permit the voters in a school district to make a levy for three years in advance, as there might be an entire change of inhabitants during that time, who, in such case, should be given an opportunity to speak for themselves whether or not they want the tax; otherwise it would be taxation without an opportunity to be heard in the matter, and contrary to the real intent of the law. As to the validity of the first levy of five mills on the dollar, would say that I am inclined to the opinion that the same is valid, and may be extended on the roll and collected at the same time the taxes for county purposes are collected.

FINZER, Adjutant-General, Portland, Oregon: DEAR Sir: Relative to the claim of one Peter Snellback for $73.93 for services rendered Oregon Territory during the Indian Wars of 1855 and 1856, permit me to say that the claim reveals the fact that claimant enlisted as a private in the Ninth Regiment of Oregon Militia on the 15th day of October, 1855, and was honora- bly discharged therefrom on the 7th day of November, 1855, mak- ing twenty-three days that claimant served in the Ninth Regiment. The claim also shows that on the 13th day of November, 1855, claimant enlisted in the Second Regiment of Oregon Mounted Vol- unteers, in which he served twenty days, deserting therefrom on the 2nd day of December, 1855. Upon this state of facts, I am of the opinion that the claimant would only be entitled to pay for the time he served in Samuel A. Fry&apos;s Company. There is no record before me as to what prompted Mr. Snellback to desert, but per- haps it was to avoid an anticipated battle with the red men, and &quot; &quot;162 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. nothing in the act which prevents their sale before they spoil and the proceeds applied to the renewal of the exhibit, or to being in- vested in other exhibits. Neither is there anything in the act which requires anything to be returned to Portland, except so much of the exhibit as shall or may be suitable for that purpose. Therefore the installation material, if the commission consider it not suitable or profitable to be removed, may be sold and the pro- ceeds applied to the Portland exhibit. Matters of that kind were necessarily entrusted to the good judgment of the commission. Section 15 contains the only clause requiring the return of any money to the State Treasury, and that is money which may be realized at the close of the exposition at Portland by the sale of any property which shall at that time belong to the State, in the possession or control of the commission. Perishable or other articles which for any reason become useless to the commission, can, in my opinion, be sold and the proceeds applied to the purposes of the exposition. Respectfully submitted, A.

The plan of holding in Portland, Oregon, in 1905, the exposition referred to in the act, originated in the year 1901 with the citizens of the Northwest. Before the end of that year the movement crystallized in the organization, &apos; &quot;[ 9 ] 45. State v. I. D. Huffman. Rape.

I think a court would hold that the person appointed under it to be doing business for the corporation, especially if the corporation accepted the fruits of the labor. I think the prin- ciple announced in Hooper v. People of State of California, Vol. 15, Supreme Court Reporter, page 211, is in point in this matter: the court says: “If the contention of the plaintiff in error were admitted, the established authority of the State to prevent a for- eign corporation from carrying on business within its limits, either absolutely or upon certain conditions, would be destroyed. It would only be necessary for such a corporation to have an under- standing with a resident that in the effecting of contracts between itself and other residents of the State, he should be considered the agent of the insured persons, and not of the company. This would make the exercise of a substantial and valuable power by a State government depend, not on the actual facts of the transactions on which it lawfully seeks to extend its control, but upon the disposi- tion of a corporation to resort to a mere subterfuge in order to evade obligations properly imposed upon it. Public policy forbids a construction of the law which leads to such a result, unless log- ically unavoidable.&apos; If you are still of the opinion that in view of the duties of an alvisor under the law the conclusion is logically unavoidable, that he is not an agent within the purview of the statute, I will be pleased to hear from you further, but with the light I have at present on the subject, I am unable to concur.

BOYD, Plaintiff and Respondent, V. F. I. DU&apos;NBAR, Secretary of State, Defendant and Appellant. In August, 1903, plaintiff filed a petition in the circuit court for Multnomah County for an alternative writ of mandamus to compel defendant, as Secretary of State, to audit and draw a war- rant on the State Treasurer for $129.50, which sum plaintiff claims is due him from the State of Oregon, under and by virtue of an act of the legislature, filed in the office of the Secretary of State, February 24, 1903, which act provides for compensating volun- teers for the service of the Territory of Oregon during the Indian Wars of 1855-56, for such services, and appropriating the sum of $100,000 therefor. Defendant, in pursuance of the provisions of said act, and upon proper vouchers, drew warrants in satisfaction of said Indian war veterans&apos; claims to the full amount of the said $100,000, and at the time plaintiff&apos;s claim was presented, said appropriation was exhausted, and therefore defendant, as Secretary of State, refused to audit or draw a warrant for plaintiff&apos;s claim, there being no appropriation out of which to pay the same, and notified plaintiff of this fact. Upon plaintiff&apos;s petition, Hon. John B, Cleland, judge of the circuit court for Multnomah County, issued an alternative writ of mandamus, commanding the defendant, as Secretary of State, to andit said claim and draw a warrant therefor, or to appear in court and show reason for not so doing. Whereupon defendant answered, setting up the said act of the legislature and the other facts above stated, to which answer the plaintiff demurred, and after argument upon said demurrer, the same sustained, and judgment rendered commanding the defendant, as Secretary was &quot; &quot;72 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, March 31, 1903. Hon. Geo. E. CHAMBERLAIN, Governor: DEAR SIR: Relative to your inquiry of the 28th instant as to whether in my opinion, under section 3294, you have the authority to appoint an agent to select lands to which this State is entitled under the laws of the United States or otherwise, and whether the salary of such agent, and other expenses incidental to the duties to be performed, can be paid out of the appropriation made by the legislative assembly just adjourned, which appropriation is in the following language: “For the payment of the salary and clerk hire of the State Land Agent, $3,600.&amp;quot; The language of the appropriation explains what it can be paid out for, to wit: salary and clerk hire of the State Land Agent. If section 1 of the act of 1899 is repealed, and the only law re- maining on that subject is section 3294 of Bellinger and Cotton&apos;s Codes, the agent would only be the agent of the land commissions, and his duty would be to locate lands. He might be appointed by the State Land Board to look after the farms and mortgaged lands of the State, but his compensation and expenses for such services would have to come out of the school fund interest. Section 3294 authorizes the Governor, as Land Commissioner, to appoint agents to locate the lands to which this State is entitled, and he shall be allowed all necessary expenses incurred by him in performing the duties prescribed by the act, but no appropria- tion is made out of which to pay the same, and the appropriation above referred to, was undoubtedly made with reference to the act of 1899, page 94, section 1, which Judge Bellinger holds is repealed. The duties of the State Land Agent are prescribed in the last- mentioned act, and are not the same as the duties to be performed by the agent the Governor is authorized to appoint under said section 3294. Therefore I am of the opinion that in view of Judge Bellinger&apos;s opinion kindly enclosed in your letter, that section 1 of the act of 1899 is repealed, and the Secretary would not be authorized to pay the agent out of the appropriation mentioned, and I know of no other appropriation out of which it could be &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 37 ant and the land claimed, which is the same amount in the same section.

ACKERMAN, Superintendent of Public Instruction: DEAR SIR: Relative to your request for my opinion as to the construction which should be given to that portion of subdi- vision 11 of section 3389 of Bellinger and Cotton&apos;s Annotated Codes and Statutes, reading as follows, to wit: “The board of directors of any school district may transfer to another district any child, whenever the parent or guardian shall present a writ- ten request, accompanied by a written permit from the board of directors of the adjoining district, etc.,&apos;&apos; as to whether the same is mandatory or only permissive, would say it is difficult to deter- mine just what the intention of the legislature was in enacting said subdivision without being informed as to the facts or condi- tions which existed to prompt the framer of the law to draft the However, I can conceive of a state of facts existing where a man with his family might live one or two miles from the school house in his district, and near the line between his district and the adjoining district, and the school house in the adjoining district be much nearer his residence, for instance within one- same. &quot; &quot;176 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. in any way recognized the State&apos;s claim of title, or if the claim- ant and her grantors have not been in actual possession as above mentioned for at least ten years prior to the amendment of the stat- ute, the State is not barred. The abstract is silent on both of these points By an examination of the Wagnon deeds on record, the first point can be determined, and the second by a personal examin- ation of the lot and inquiries as to the occupation thereof for the last 15 or 20 years. It appears from the price paid by Mrs. Mc- Cormick and her grantors that they knew all about the State&apos;s claim, and figured to pay it if compelled to do so. The State has received no part of the principal or interest of said loan, and in my opinion it is bad policy on the part of the board to give deeds which serve only the purpose of confirming the title to land, se- cured from the State through the statute of limitations, and es- pecially when the price paid shows that the State&apos;s interest must have been taken into consideration and provided for in case the State insisted on payment before barred by the statute. In this case the only proof of fraud or knowledge on the part of the claim- ant, of the State&apos;s claim shown by the abstract, is the inadequacy of price, but to give a deed would be a reward for success in de- priving the State of $150 of its school fund and interest thereon for over twenty years.

WOODS HUTCHINSON, State II ealth Officer, Portland, Oregon: DEAR SIR: Replying to yours of the 9th instant relative to : the law of 1903, establishing a State Board of Health, permit me to say that I have examined the same in regard to the particulars you mention, and am of the opinion that the authority granted in section 10 of the act authorizes you to act in lieu of the county board provided in section 9, and that expenses incurred while act- ing under section 10 could be charged against the county to the same extent that they could be if the county board acted under section 9. As to how far you would be liable for making state- ments in discharge of your duties which would be injurious to others, as merchants, butchers, hotel-keepers, etc., would say, if it becomes necessary to disclose the existence of any disease or dan- gerous condition of any article or thing, to protect the public from its injurious effects, or to enable you to treat or remove the dan- yer, then you would be protected in giving out the information, but you would not be protected in giving out the information which would injure a person&apos;s business or reputation, unless neces- sary for the protection of the public as above stated. As to the Washington trip, would call your attention to section 3, which says the beard shall have power to send its secretary, or a committee to any part of the State when deemed necessary, and that is the only section which says anything about sending a mem- ber or a committee anywhere, and I am of the opinion that the board would have that power if the act said nothing on the sub- &quot; &quot;136 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. refunded, I see no reason why the directors can not do so.

Also a resolution was duly voted by the legal voters directly authorizing a loan to refund present indebtedness to the amount of $75,000. It is not necessary to loan the full amount at once. Yours respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. one. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, November 19, 1903. Hox. ROBERT EAKIN, Judge of the Eighth Judicial District, Baker City, Oregon. DEIR SIR: Since you were here I have put in some time examin- ing the question of the execution of Pleasant Armstrong, and have come to the conclusion that the course you marked out is the proper That the execution should take place by virtue of the old warrant, and in Baker City. The warrant for the execution was issued March 31, 1903. The law of 1903 became operative May 22, 1903. Therefore the war- rant was issued prior to the taking effect of the said act requiring executions to take place at the penitentiary, and brings the case squarely within the saving clause of section 4 of the act; providing “This act shall not be construed to affect the execution of any warrant issued prior to the taking effect of this measure.” When the warrant was issued no appeal had been taken, and there can be no doubt that the warrant would have to be exe- cuted in that county by the sheriff thereof, the same as though no amendments had been enacted. The next question is, did the appeal taken by the defendant an- nul the warrant, the case having been affirmed on appeal? A cer- tificate of probable cause was granted in this case, and the effect thereof, as declared by our code, sections 1475 and 1478, was to suspend the further execution thereof until the appeal was dis- posed of, and would, in my opinion, suspend the further execution of the warrant from the date of granting the certificate of probable 6 &quot; &apos;62 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. General shall prescribe what evidence he deems necessary to prove a claim. In answer to question 3, permit me to say that I do not think the heirs of a deceased volunteer are entitled to compensation for services rendered by him for the reasons set forth in the opinion herewith inclosed, and the act nowhere indicates that such was the intention of the legislature, and I am also informed by one of the supporters of the measure that it was the intention of the legislature to only pay the survivors. Referring to question 4, permit me to say that the appropriation is made in the following language: “That there be and hereby is appropriated out of the general funds in the treasury of the State of Oregon, the sum of $100,000, or so much thereof as shall be necessary to pay the veterans of the Indian Wars of 1855-56 who served under and by virtue of the directions of the officers of Ore- yon Territory, for their services, under the conditions and upon the terms herein before provided.&quot; Then the act provides how it shall ” be disbursed, to wit: on vouchers of the Adjutant-General. The Secretary has no discretion in the matter, the act reading &quot;shall issue his warrant for the amount found due the claimant.” If the voucher is in proper form, the Secretary can be compelled to issue the warrant, and the Treasurer must pay the same. The act saying “That there be and hereby is appropriated, etc.&quot; certainly makes an appropriation, and the Secretary being com- pelled to draw the warrants, under certain conditions, it seems to me that all other powers, if any necessary, to carry the act into force and effect are implied. Our Supreme Court has decided that &quot;an appropriation is a setting aside or designation of a particular fund for the discharge of certain definite, specific obligations,” Shattuck v. Kincaid, 31 Or. 386. And in McCauley v. Brooks, 16 Cal. 28, cited in the Kincaid case, Field J. says: “To an appropriation within the meaning of the constitution nothing is more requisite than a desig- nation of the amount, and the fund out of which it shall be paid. It is not essential to its validity that funds to meet the same should at the time be in the treasury.&quot; Under those authorities and others cited in the Kincaid case, I am of the opinion that section 1 of the act makes a legal appropriation. Very respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &apos; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 27 wherein the plaintiff seeks to hold the Secretary of State as gar- nishee, he being the disbursing officer of the State moneys.

WASHINGTON COUNTY, Defendant. This action was brought by the State against Washington County in the circuit court for said county to collect interest claimed by the State, under and by virtue of the act of the legis- lature found on pages 47, 48, and 49 of the session laws of 1893, on the delinquent payment by said county to the State of its por- tion of the State scalp bounty fund for the year 1900. The case has not yet been tried in the circuit court, and is now pending therein. &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 91 act of 1901. The balance of said act remains in force unless re- pealed by implication, and I find no conflict with the law of 1901, which would impliedly repeal the former act. The conflict would have to be irreconcilable. The next act is the act of 1901, which, after providing an annual levy in the State taxes for the benefit of the college of $25,000, and that it shall be kept separate from the other funds, and be known as the Agricultural College Fund, pro- vides that “This fund shall be paid out only on warrants drawn by the Secretary of State on the State Treasurer against said fund. This fund shall be a continuing fund, and if the amount raised in any year shall not be used for current expenses, etc., as herein pro- vided, during that year, the balance remaining in the hands of the Treasurer shall be carried over to the next year, and added to the fund for that year. The said fund shall be drawn quarterly by . the treasurer of the board of regents.” It provides no other requisite conditions or acts to be done, kept, or perfermed on the part of the board of regents, prior to drawing the money, than prescribed in the act of 1885, before referred to, and still in force, to wit: The Secretary of State shall draw his warrant on the uritten request of the treasurer of the board of regents, counter- signed by the secretary. The law provides for no other requisi- . tion, evidence, proof, or papers to be furnished before the Secretary of State shall draw his warrant on the Treasurer, and the Secre- tary is not authorized to demand any. The foregoing principles are sustained by the courts. In the case of Avery l&apos;. Job, 25 Or. at page 525, Bean, Justice, delivering the opinion of the court, says: “No principle of equity jurispru- dence is perhaps better established than that when the officers of a municipal corporation are clothed with a discretionary power, and are acting within the scope of that power, a court of equity will not sit in review of their proceedings, or interfere by injunction * * unless fraud is shown or the power or discretion is being mani- festly abused to the oppression of the citizens.” Citing, 2 High on Injunctions, section 1240. 82 Cal. 286. 16 Amer.

CONN, District Attorney, Lakeview, Oregon: DEAR Sır: Yours of the 21st instant, relative to county clerks retaining the fees received in making final proofs, etc., in land office matters, received, and, after making an examination of the statutes, I am of the opinion that they have that right. Section 2935 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. provides that &quot;No one of such officials shall be entitled to receive any fees or other compensation for their ser- vices than as above provided, and except as hereinafter provided.” But, in my opinion, the services referred to in this section are services which are required of the clerk by virtue of the laws of Oregon. If he performs services under the laws of the United States. I see no reason why he can not retain the fees for the same. The statute of Washington, upon which the opinion of the Attorney- General was based, reads as follows: “Any county officer who is paid a salary, who shall fail to pay to the county treasury all sums that shall have come into his hands for fees and charges in his office, or by virtue of his office, whether under the laws of this State or of the United States, shall be deemed to be guilty of embezzlement in office, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than one year, nor more than three years; provided further, upon conviction, his office shall be declared vacant by the court pro- nouncing sentence.&quot; You will notice that this statute provides for all fees and charges received by virtue of his office, whether under the State law or the Laws of the United States. If our statute provided that the clerk shall turn over all moneys received by virtue of his office, I am of the opinion that he could be compelled to account and pay over the same to the treasurer, but as our laws are silent on the subject of the manner of the disposition of the fees received under the United States laws, I am of the opinion that he may retain the same to his own use. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. . &apos; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 59 ܕܙ other states, which I deem it unnecessary to mention, are to the same effect. I think that we can safely say such is the consensus of opinion. In Carpenter 1. Montgomery, ante, the court says: “That of the existence of the emergency the legislature must necessarily be the judges, and when they deem it to exist they have a right to declare a statute in force from and after its pas- sage.&apos; Section 5 of the act recites that “Whereas the Territory of Oregon, by an act of the legislature passed on the 24th day of January, 1856, promised to pay the veterans serving in the said Indian Wars, the same compensation as above set forth, and said Territory nor the State of Oregon, has ever paid for said services, and many of the said volunteers have died without even their losses, in said war, being compensated, an emergency exists, etc.” The legislature by the foregoing language plainly declares that certain facts created an emergency, and as to whether the facts were sufficient, it was the exclusive and final judge, and its decision thereon is not reviewable. For the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion that the bill under consideration is not within the referendum clause of sec- tion 1, as amended, of article 4 of the constitution, and that the emergency clause is sufficient under said section 28, and that the bill went into effect on the day it was filed with the Secretary, to wit: the 24th ultimo. Upon a close examination of the act I am inclined to answer your second question in the negative, relative to whether the pro- visions of the lay apply to widows and orphans of the deceased veterans. I suppose that the real question intended is whether the heirs at law or any legal representative of a deceased veteran are entitled to receive the amount which he would receive, if living. In the original bill introduced, proof of service, list of horses, and identity of person could be made by affidavit of himself and at least one other person. The veteran certainly could not make the affidavit, unless living. In the bill as it finally passed, no com- pensation was allowed for horses, but for service in the field *? per day was allowed for himself. The words “for himself” are not necessary unless it was intended to apply only to the present survivors among those who participated in the wars mentioned. and the amount of money appropriated indicates the same. tion 3 of the act provides that the claim for such services verified &quot; &apos;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 139 OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL.

State Land Board: GENTLEMEN : Relative to the claim of Mr. Marks for payment of purchase money and interest from date of purchase on 160 acres of land purchased by Mr. Marks, November 17, 1875, under the Swamp Land Act of 1870, and for which the title failed, and the State was unable to convey title to said Marks thereto. The first payment of twenty per cent. was made, and nothing further paid or done, and no reclamation made or attempted. The land was afterward held to be not swamp, and the State never received title thereto from the United States; therefore could not convey the same to Mr. Marks. Section 3310 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. provides that “Where any lands have been sold which the board could not, and can not convey to the purchaser, but which have been bought and paid for under a misapprehension of the condition of the same, the board on the production of satisfactory proofs of such facts, and the conveyance by duly executed and recorded quit-claim deed of whatever title or color of title was received from the State, shall order the amount paid to the board in the payment of such land, including the amount paid to the board as interest on deferred payments, to be repaid to such purchaser, his heirs, or assigns, from the fund or funds which received the payment made in the purchase of said lands, and transmit to the next legislature a report of such trans- action.&quot; Section 3311 provides that any person who has paid to the State Land Board any money on lands to which the State Land Board could not, and can not, convey title, shall be entitled to repayment of the amount paid, and interest at five per cent from date of pay- ment, provided no interest shall be allowed if the purchaser had or could have had the use and possession of the land on which the payment was made. Said section 3311 reads &quot;lands which have been bought and paid for, etc.” While the land which Mr. Marks contracted to buy was not paid for, but only the first in- stallment paid, and therefore not within the strict letter of the law, in justice he should be repaid his first payment of twenty per cent., but no interest, as there is nothing to show that he could not have had the use of the land he applied to purchase, and a strict &apos; &quot;112 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. : for 1897, $3.18; for 1898, $3.57; for 1899, $2.96; total $9.71; and on lots 5 and 6 of block 1, and three-fourths of lot 5, and all of lots 6 and 7 of block 2, for 1897, $23.93; for 1898, $25.15; for 1899, $28.74; grand total, $87.53.

As to the tract that was purchased by R. R. Dunn, of San Fran- cisco, I have been unable to secure his address so far, and can not say how much he has paid or claims.

Comp. provides in general terms for the payment to the sheriffs by the State of the expenses of conveying criminals to the penitentiary. This law was enacted in 1874. an:} has been acted upon ever since, and the State has paid for the transportation of all criminals sent to the penitentiary.

TRUMBULL, Secretary Child Labor Commission, Portland, Oregon: DEAR MADAM: Relative to the questions propounded in yours of the 11th instant, permit me to say that I do not think that sec- tion 3 of the act of 1903, to regulate child labor, repeals that por- tion of the old compulsory education law, which provides that a child between the ages of 8 and 14 years, shall attend school at least twelve weeks. It does not make the term twelve weeks, but says the child must attend that length of time each year. The 1903 law provides that the child shall attend during the whole of the school term in the district or city in which the child resides. This in no way conflicts with the old law. If the term is twenty-four weeks, the child must attend, and if it does attend for that length of time, it can not be claimed that it has not attended at least twelve weeks. No school term under the law is less than twelve weeks, but should a term be less, then the parent or guardian must provide other school privileges for the child until it has attended school at least twelve weeks. Repeals by implication are not favored, and in this case there is no particular conflict between the laws. As to the punishment for violation of section 3 of the law of 1903, I doubt whether there is any. The act only provides for punishment for violations as to the employment of children con- trary to law, but says nothing relative to making it the duty of the parents or guardian to send them to school; simply says attendance shall be compulsory, and provides no penalty if section is not com- plied with. It does not even make a violation of it a misdemeanor, punishable under the general law for punishment of misdemeanors. However, if parents or guardians do not send the child to school at least twelve weeks, they can be punished under section 3424 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp., and it is the duty of the directors and clerks of each school district to see that the law is enforced in their respective districts. Very respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 199 1902, said lands were sold by the sheriff to collect the tax so levied? on said assessment, one Mary Elder being the purchaser. After- wards Mary Elder assigned her certificate of purchase to Carey F. Martin, and on the 12th day of April, 1904, the sheriff duly executed and delivered to said Martin a tax deed therefor. It appears from the foregoing that the title of the property was in the State prior to the assessment and levy of said taxes, and that the same was at said date not assessable, but was exempt from taxa- tion under the provisions of section 3039 of B. &amp;amp; C. Compilation. Also it has been decided by our Supreme Court that taxes levied prior to the law of 1901 were not a lien upon real property anı! would not take precedence of a mortgage executed prior to the levy of the taxes. Middleton v. Moore, 43 Or. 357; Ferguson v. Kaboth, 43 Or. 414. I am therefore of the opinion that Mr. Martin has no legal claim for taxes against said lands. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, July 13, 1904. Hon. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Yours of the 12th instant requesting my interpre- tation of the acts found at page 242 session laws of 1903, and at page 32, laws of 1903, special session, relative to salaries of the prosecuting attorneys of the First Judicial District, has my at- tention, Prior to the act first above mentioned, there was but one prose- cuting attorney for said district, drawing a salary of $3,000 per annum, but by the provisions of said act, said judicial district was divided into two prosecuting attorney districts, the first com- posed of the counties of Josephine and Jackson, and the second of the counties of Klamath and Lake. Hon. A. E. Reames was appointed prosecuting attorney for the first district, with a salary of $2.000 per annum, and Hon. L. F. Conn for the second district, with a salary of $1,500 per annum. Section 10 of said act reads: “All acts and parts of acts in conflict with this act are hereby re- &quot; &quot;80 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. but those already existing. Also the words “incurred,” “intro- ducer,&apos;&apos; “listing,&apos;&apos; and “describing, as used in section 1, all relate to something already done, and not to anything to be done in the future. The words “ &apos;expenses incurred” can not be construed to mean expenses to be hereafter incurred. Section 3 of the act di- rects the Secretary of State “To issue warrants on the State Treasurer, in payment of the foregoing claims, and for the objects set forth in sections 1 and 2 of the act; provided, that all claims for the several amounts shall be presented prior to December 31, 1904. The payment for foregoing claims certainly includes claims already existing, while the words and for the objects set forth in section 1 and 2 of the act,&amp;quot; taken together with the latter part of section 3 might be construed to mean that the appropriation should include expenses necessarily incurred in carrying out the objects of the original act creating the office of State Biologist, at any time prior to the 31st day of December, 1904, hy which time all claims under the act must be presented for payment, and I am of the opinion that such was the intention of the legislature, al- though as to that the act is not very clear. There is no question but that all claims for expenses incurred prior to the date the act takes effect are within the purview of the law. Therefore I am of the opinion that the appropriation for the State Biologist becomes available May 21, 1903, for the payment of all proper expenses incurred for the purpose of the act, prior to said date, and also for expenses which may be incurred after said date for the objects set forth in the act, up to December 31, 1904.

Cooley on Constitution and Limitations, 6 edition, page 72, says: “The rule applicable here is, that effect is to be given, if possible, to the whole instrument, and to every section and clause. If dif- ferent portions seem to conflict, the courts must harmonize them, if practicable, and must lean in favor of a construction which will render every word operative, rather than one which may make some words idle and nugatory. This rule is applicable with spe- cial force to written constitutions, in which the people will be pre- sumed to have expressed themselves in careful and measured terms, corresponding with the immense importance of the powers dele- gated, leaving as little as possible to implication. It is scarcely conceivable that a case can arise when a court would be justified in declaring any portion of a written constitution nugatory be- cause of ambiguity. One part may qualify another so as to re- strict its operation, or apply it otherwise than the natural construc- tion would require if it stood by itself; but one part is not allowed to defeat another if by any reasonable construction the two can be made to stand together.&quot; In seeking to interpret the meaning of a constitutional provi- sion, the intent of the framers of the instrument should, if possi- ble, be ascertained and carried out.

Applying the foregoing principles to said two sections of the constitution, and upon the point under consideration they read, The second power reserved by the people is the referèndum, and it may be ordered, except as to laws necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, and except also such laws as are passed &apos; &quot;[7] DISINTERRING HUMAN BODY, State y, Magone.

If this is true, either the State of Oregon, or the United States can alone condemn the right of way and build the canal; and I can conceive of no good reason why they may not unite and jointly perform what either may do alone. It has been held in some of the States, notably Michigan, in Trombly v. Humphrey, 23 Mich. 471, that a State can not exercise the power of eminent domain for the United States. In that case the court says: “In the exercise of its sovereignty, and as a part of its provision for the regulation, control, and protection of com- merce, the United States erects lighthouses, and may without ques- tion seize the property of individuals for the purpose, observing the constitutional requirement of making due compensation there- for. To do this, would be an ordinary exercise of the right of emi- nent domain. But when the State undertakes to do the same, not for any purpose of its own, but in order to turn the property over to the United States, the difficulties appear to us insurmountable. In the first place there can be no necessity for the exercise of this right by the States for this purpose, for the authority of the nation is ample for the supply of its own needs in this regard under all circumstances. In the second place, the eminent domain in any sovereignty exists only for its own purpose; and to furnish ma- chinery to the General Government, and by means of which it is to appropriate lands for national objects, is not among the ends contemplated in the creation of the State Government.&apos; To the same effect is Darlington v. United States, 82 Pa. St. 387. How- ever, the opposite view has been almost universally taken by the other States. In Orr v. Quimby, 54 N. H. 592, the court holds that a State may condemn land for the United States, using the fol- lowing language: “In the argument of this case, the power of a State to condemn property within its limits for the use of the United States was not disputed. Only four reported cases in which that question has ever arisen have fallen under our observa- tion. In Redall v. Bryan, 14 Md. 444, Gilmer v. Lime Point, 18 Cal. 229, and Burt v.

DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR Sir: Relative to whether a foreign corporation engaged SIR in a general insurance business can come into this State and trans- act a “credit insurance,” I invite your attention to section 13 of an act entitled “An Act to License and Regulate Insurance Busi- ness in the State of Oregon,&amp;quot; filed in the office of the Secretary of State, February 25, 1887, session laws, page 124, the same being section 3718 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. which provides, “No company not incorporated in the United States shall be permitted to transact an insurance business in this State, except marine insurance, unless the same shall have deposited or invested for the benefit of its policy holders in the United States in at least one State a sum equal to two hundred thousand dollars in gold in excess of its liabilities in the United States, nor until such company shall have deposited fifty thousand dollars with the State Treasurer in approved se- curities.” If doing &amp;quot;credit insurance&amp;quot; is doing any kind of insurance, it comes within the purview of the act, and of that section; and sec- tion 21 of the act, page 124, of the session laws, and section 3735 of the code provides that the act shall apply to all companies doing business as insurers in the State. If therefore they are insurers in any sense of the term, they must comply with the terms of the act. Not being incorporated under any of the laws of any of the United States of America, but being strictly foreign, to wit: being incorporated under the laws of the British Empire, if the company should deem that &amp;quot;credit insurance&amp;quot; is a surety business, they can not do business in this State, for the reason that unless incor- porated under the laws of some State of the United States, as is fully shown by Attorney-General Blackburn&apos;s opinion of Novem- ber 11, 1901, 2 Vol. page 371, they can not do a surety business in this State under our statutes. The State has attempted to legislate in a manner to secure its citizens, in their dealing with insurance companies, and in so doing has, in my opinion, indicated its policy to be that no company, per- son, or organization shall do an insurance business in this State until they have demonstrated their ability to carry out the terms &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 7 REPAYMENTS. Applicants for repayment of money paid to the State upon con- tracts for land where the title of the State has failed, demand not only the principal, but interest thereon at the rate of five per cent. per annum from date of payment. Sections 3310 and 3311 of Bellinger and Cotton&apos;s Compilation provide in substance that no interest shall be paid where the purchaser, by reason of his payment to the State, had, or could have had the use and possession of the land on which he made the payment. This office has held that the legislature, in passing said statute, did not con- sider physical conditions, and intend to pay interest, because the land was rocky, mountainous, or timber land, and therefore the purchaser could not take actual possession thereof, but that when for some legal reason, such as a valid homestead claim and land occupied by such claimant, the State&apos;s purchaser was prevented from taking possession of his purchase, he could demand repay- ment of principal with interest. All claims referred to this office have been reported according to said rule, and we understand the State Land Board has adopted the same, which if so, will save the State large sums of money, and a considerable sum has already been saved by reason thereof. The State Land Agent&apos;s report will show the amount, during the time covered by this report. The United States Land Department has finally rejected what is known as the mineral base lieu selections, embracing about 90,- 000 acres, and which lands were selected at the suggestion of, contracted for, and part of the purchase price paid by timber land speculators, who expected in that way to secure valuable timber lands, worth from $10 to $20 an acre for $2.50 an acre, and we submit that the State is under neither legal normoral obli- gations to repay interest. Computing the amount paid on the above lands at $2 per acre, and interest thereon at five per cent, for three years, would be a saving of $27,000 in interest for those lands alone, and there are many other cases of failure of title. MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS. There are numerous matters which have come before this office, been examined, and advice given orally, the most frequently by State officers calling and asking some question which would be examined and answered without writing a formal opinion, and &quot; &quot;[ 4 ] &amp;gt; 6.

SALEM, Oregon, October 5, 1903. Hox. G. G. BROWN, Clerk of State Land Board: DEJR SIR: Relative to the question propounded in yours of the 28th ultimo, as to whether a deed executed July 15, 1895, and re- corded the same day, would take precedence over a judgment dock- eted the same day, as is shown in abstract from Wallowa County, and forwarded to you by Mr. J. D. McCully, permit me to say that section 5359 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. provides that every conveyance of real property in this State which shall not be recorded within five days after its execution shall be void, as against any subsequent purchaser in good faith, etc. Section 5357 requires every county clerk to certify upon every conveyance recorded by him the time when it was received, and a reference to the book and page where it is recorded, and such con- veyance shall be considered recorded at the time it was so received. The abstract does not show the time when the deed was received for record by the county clerk, except it shows the day on which , it was recorded. Section 207 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. provides that a con- veyance of real property, or any portion thereof, or interest therein, shall be void, as against the lien of a judgment, unless such con- veyance be recorded at the time of docketing such judgment, or the transcript thereof, or unless it be recorded within the time after its execution provided by law, as between conveyances for the same real property. The abstract shows the judgment to have been entered and dock- eted the same day as the executing and recording of the deed. The time of day is not given in either case, and from the above sec- tions of the Code, the question is one of priority of time, which is not shown by the abstract, and as far as the abstract goes, it would be a matter for parol testimony, and a splendid opportunity for a lawsuit. Nothing in the record before me gives any light on the question of priority, and the judgment is not yet barred by the statute of limitations, therefore it is not a safe record to accept as security for a loan. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. a &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 107 OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 17, 1903. Hon. JEFFERSON MYERS, President Louis and Clark Centennial Exposition Commission, Portland, Oregon: DEAR SIR: Relative to yours of the 1st instant propounding the question, “Should a commissioner be employed in any other ca- pacity by the State Commission to perform service other than to act as a commissioner, is there any reason why the said commission can not pay him compensation for his work ?” permit me to say that paragraph &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; of section 3 of the act provides that “The members of the commission shall serve without compensation, but they shall all be allowed their necessary traveling expenses, and hotel expenses while absent from their place of business, on any duty or business authorized by this act, or by the commission.&apos; The commission is empowered and directed to secure and promote a full and complete exhibition of the arts, industries, manufac- tures, and products of the river, soil, mines, forests, and sea, at the City of Portland, and to carry out the provisions of the act. It is made the duty to do all and everything necessary to carry out the provisions of the act, and to act in connection with the executive committee of the Lewis and Clark Centennial and Ameri- can Exposition and Oriental Fair. The commission has full and complete control of the expenditure of the money appropriated by the State for the fair to be held in Portland in 1905, and its duty is to expend the same for the purpose for which it was appro. priated, and any duty necessary to be performed for the purpose, is the duty of the commission, and I am unable to discover any service in connection with the expenditure of the $500,000 appro- priation by the State which is not a service to be performed by the commission. The commission shall secure exhibits, erect build- ings, procure site for the same, employ agents, servants, and em- ployees to do whatever the commission can not otherwise perform. It would be very difficult to draw a line between the duties of a commissioner and services other than to act as commissioner. Also the commission would have to pass upon the accounts of its own members, and the members would be acting in a double capacity, being a claimant, and at the same time judging their own claims. From a careful examination of the act and its &quot; &quot;openES | 1 | &quot; &quot;144 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. That the proposed canal when built will be of great commercia! advantage to the people of the northeastern part of this State, can not be questioned, and I find nothing in the Constitution of the State of Oregon which prohibits the State from appropriating money for internal improvements, and in the light of all the authorities I have been able to examine in the brief time I have had to devote to the matter, it is my opinion that the State can, by appropriate legislation, permit the United States, or its agents, to condemn the right of way for the canal in the state courts, and can appropriate money to defray the expenses of such condemna- tion proceedings, including judgments for land taken. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &amp;gt; OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, December 9, 1903. State Land Board: GENTLEMEN: Relative to the application of John Adair, Jr., for repayment of the twenty per centum of purchase price paid on swamp land certificates Nos. 9 and 10, April 6, 1872, under the act of 1870, with interest thereon at five per cent. from date of payment, I find the facts to be as follows: April 8, 1871, said Adair made application to the State Land Board to purchase 4,384.85 acres of land, which, in his application to purchase, he represented to be swamp land. April 6, 1872, he paid twenty per cent. of the purchase price, as required by law, and received his certificates of purchase from the board. The amount so paid was $876.97. That he never reclaimed the land, nor made any further payments thereon, but entirely ig- nored and dropped the matter until he filed his application for re- payment a short time since. January 22, 1899, the board made an order, under the law of 1887, cancelling said certificate No. 10, but did not cancel No. 9. There is no evidence that Adair was ever notified of the cancella- tion. That the State has received patent to 1,278.94 acres of the land described in certificate No. 9, and 463.16 acres have never been patented to the State. &quot; &quot;88 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. a islative assembly of 1901, in support of the college, permit me to say that I have carefully examined the acts creating the colleg., and all acts concerning it passed since, and what authorities I have been able to find touching the matter, and also the opinions of my able predecessor regarding the same subject, and have in- formed myself as well as I have been able by inquiries of others as to the object of the college, and the manner of conducting the busi- ness of the same, and have arrived at the following conclusions, to wit: First, that the State Agricultural, College is munici. pal corporation, and governed by a board of regents, which board has the sole and exclusive control and management thereof. (Laws of 1885, Sees. 2, 3, and 4, page 10.) It takes no argument to show that the college is a municipal corporation. Section 2 of the act above referred to creates it a corporation, and under section 2 of ar ticle 11 of our State Constitution, the legislative assembly can not by special act create a corporation, except for municipal purposes. Having created this corporation by special act, the legislature in- tended thereby to create a municipal corporation, and the func- tions it performs are in the nature of those performed by municipal corporations. Also the status of the college as a corporation has been decided by the Supreme Court of this State in the case of Liggett v. Ladd et al, 23 Or. 26, approving Dunn v. University of Oregon, 9 Or. 357. Second, that any person performing services for said corpora- tion, either as teacher, common laborer, furnishing supplies there- for, or otherwise, is not in the employ of the State of Oregon, but in the employ of the said corporation, and must look to it alone for payment. The contracts for services performed, or materials furnished are made with the corporation and not with the State. The claim for the same must be audited by the governing board of the corporation. There is no law making the Secretary of State appellate officer before whom the decision of the board can be re- viewed, and he has no such authority by virtue of his office. He is the auditor of claims against the State, but not the auditor of any other municipal corporation, unless the act creating the cor- poration expressly makes him such auditor. If the board should allow a claim, is there any authority vested in the Secretary of State to disallow it? I am unable to find any law even intimating &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 143 The Washington case announces the doctrine that the character of the work can not be essentially altered by its ownership or con- trol, and that it is immaterial whether the General Government of the State prosecutes the enterprise, or whether they do it jointly, or whether the power of the State or of the United States is invoked to condemn the right of way. It can not be urged that if the con- trol does not remain in the officers or agents of the State, the State can not exercise the right of eminent domain, as it has always been conceded that where improvements are for a public use and benefit, the State can authorize the exercise of its eminent domain by private corporations, demestic or foreign, and it has frequently done so in the construction of railroads, and other internal im- provements, and it may delegate the right to other municipal cor- porations, and private individuals, and there is no good reason which suggests itself to my mind why it can not delegate like all- thority to the General Government, or its agents. The State has a general power to condemn land for public use, and for this pur- pose may select her own agent. In many of the cases where a State has enacted a law permitting the agent of the Federal Government to use the courts of the State for the purpose of acquiring land for the construction of works of public use, the United States Government has paid the expenses, but in the present proposition, I understand the State must pay for the right of way whether it is secured by purchase or condemna- tien proceedings, and I am inclined to the opinion that it is a mat- ter for which the legislature can, if in its wisdom it sees proper, appropriate funds of the State, and levy taxes therefor. In Dagget v. Colgan, the Supreme Court of California held that the act of 1891, appropriating moneys of the State for the purpose of “Erecting and maintaining an exhibit of the products of the State,&amp;quot; at the World&apos;s Columbian Exposition, was not unconstitu- tional, and that the appropriation was for a public use. New York has held that a tax to pay the expenses of a State canal is not unconstitutional. Massachusetts, that the erection of a memorial hall for the use of soldiers and sailors is a public pur- pose, for which money may be raised under legislative authority by taxation. Michigan and Illinois, that money so raised may be expended for a public park. Wisconsin, that a breakwater to pro- tect streets against a lake, is a public use for which the legislature might appropriate money. &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 15 Hali- in the court at was ceedings were had thereunder that on the 24th day of October, 1902, the defendant was, on the verdict of a jury, sentenced to serve a term of four years in the penitentiary, and to pay a fine of $6,000, from which judgment he appealed to the Supreme Court.

Ilave also drawn bonds, contracts, etc., for improvements of State buildings, for wood to be furnished, etc., among which the most important are: Addition and alterations to dining hall at peni- tentiary, and addition to south end of building, $10,353. Two bonds for building on the Oregon State Insane Asylum grounds, also for closed cottage and extension of the dining-hall at the Cottage Farm of the Oregon State Insane Asylum. Contract for wood for asylum, 300 cords at $3.50 per cord. Contract for wood for State institutions. One important matter was the examination of abstract and passing upon the title, or iather the authority of the Salem Flour- ing Mills Company, the Thomas Kay Woolen Mills Company, and the Salem Water Company, private corporations, to convey to the State of Oregon the right to divert 1,200,000 gallons of water daily from the water flowing through Mill Creek, for the use of State buildings and institutions. Said corporations had acquired the right to use all the water flowing through said creek for power purposes. A satisfactory title was furnished, and the State pur- chased the right, paying the sum of $20,000 therefor. A matter of great importance to the State is the boundary line between this State and the State of Washington. This office has been requested by the Master Fish Warden, Honorable H. G. Van Dusen. to determine the same, and, on investigation, we find it very problematical where the same may be found. The license for fishing in the Columbia River fixed by the legislature of Wash- ington is a less amount than that fixed for the same class by the Oregon legislature, and consequently many fishermen take out licenses from the Washington officers, and then claim their fishing grounds to be in Washington waters, while, in fact, they are in Oregen waters and this State annually loses large sums it should secure from licenses, the same being paid to Washington. We would respectfully suggest that some action be taken by your honorable body towards a permanent settlement of said boundary line. There is now pencing before the lionorable Secretary of the Interior a motion for review involving title to over 90,000 acres of swamp land, situated in the Klamath Indian Reservation, in $ &quot; &quot;178 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. to pass on the question as to whether the certificates are sufficient under the law and only those which are in substantial compliance therewith should be filed, and the filing in no way depends on the fact as to whether or not the nominee has accepted the nomina- tion, but shall not certify to the county clerk to be placed on the official ballot the names of persons not accepting the nominations.

THOMPSON, Judge of Douglas County, Roseburg, Oregon: DEAR SIR: Relative to the matter of the amount of inheritance tax to be paid on the estate of George Shambrook, deceased, re- ferred by you to the district attorney, and by him handed to me for an opinion, permit me to say that I am of the opinion that if the estate exceeds the sum of ten thousand dollars, it is liable to pay a tax as hereinafter set forth. The will is very ambiguous in its terms, but I conclude that it was the intention of the testator to devise and bequeath (and that the courts will, if the matter should be presented to them, hold) to his wife the use of all his property, both real and personal, during her life if she remained his widow, such use burdened with the support of the two single daughters, unless they marry, and if the widow should remarry, then she should have the use of one- third of the realty for herself and no more, and after her death the property should be disposed of as in the will provided. This, I think, creates a life estate, at least as far as the realty is con- cerned, and is subject to the tax under the provisions of section 1 of the act, laws of 1903, pages 49 and 50. It evidently intends to tax any and all interests. A life estate, however, is computed according to the life annuity tables furnished you by the Secre- tary of State under the latter part of section 28 of the act, page 61. I think the Secretary has made a mistake in example No. 2 in the table or circular, a copy of which I inclose, in not allowing the de- &quot; &quot;188 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. ment roll is not yet made up in form for the sheriff should not disfranchise the voter at any meeting or election in the school dis- trict. If he were required to wait until the roll is fuily made up, which might not be until six months after the assessor had actually made the assessment of the property in any particular school dis- trict, the provision for thirty days&apos; residence in the district would? be increased to six months, and this is evidently not the intention of the law. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 13, 1904. Hon. G. G. BROWN, Clerk of State Land Board: SIR: Relative to yours of recent date, wherein you say “The State has a number of certificates of sale on which payments are delinquent for more than two years, and less than three years, and the land embraced therein has been held for cancellation by the Honorable Commissioner of the General Land Office, on account of defective basis,&amp;quot; and that the board desires my opinion as to whether they are authorized to repay the amounts paid to the State on said certificates while subject to cancellation under strict construction of law, but not under the rules of the board; permit mne to say that repayments are made under sections 3310 and 331! of B. &amp;amp; C. Compilation, and forfeitures occur under sections 330S and 3307 thereof. It needs no citation of authorities to support the proposition that when the State enters into a contract for the sale of lands, it lays aside its attributes of sovereignty as to that matter, and its contracts are to be measured and construed according to the rules governing contracts between individual citizens of the State. Sections 3310 and 3311 before mentioned are remedial in their nature. Vol. 26, Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, at page 530, de- . fines a remedial statute as “one made to supply defects or abridge superfluities in the common law arising from the general imper- fectior of human laws, the change of time and circumstances, or from any other cause whatever.” And many authorities are citec &quot; &quot;[ 12 ] In addition to the verbal and written opinions which have been given, this department has responded to numerous let- ters of inquiry from the people of this state, citizens of other states, and of foreign countries, concerning the laws and pub- lic institutions of the state and the decisions of the Supreme Court, when such answers would not interfere with official duty, but has been compelled to leave many unanswered for want of time to examine into the questions and prepare the answers.

A discount of five per cent. can only be allowed when the tax is paid within eight months from the death of the decedent. The tax on a devise or bequest of an estate, the exact amount of which can not be determined by reason of claims against the estate, is due eight months from the death of the decedent, and if delay in payment is caused for the reasons above stated, six per cent. in- terest is chargeable until the delay is removed, then eight per cent. until payment is made. The rule for computation of the time in which an act shall be done, is that the first day (in this case the day of death) shall not be included, but the last shall. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, February 5, 1904. Hon. J. W. BAKER, State Game Warden, Cottage Grove, Oregon: DEAR SIR: Replying to yours of the 27th ultimo, permit me to say that when one of the Indians from the Klamath Indian Reser- vation commits a crime or misdemeanor outside of the reservation, he is liable to punishment under the laws of the State of Oregon, and the law officers of the State have authority to arrest and deal with him the same as they would with a white person under similar circumstances. The treaty made between those Indians and the United States of date October 14, 1864, 16 Statutes at Large, page 707, does not reserve to the Indians the right to hunt and fish in the ceded lands, and therefore they would have no greater rights in that respect outside of the reservation than citizens of the State. You speak of a certain Colonel Charles White, now deceased, having been present at the concluding of the treaty with the Warm Spring Indians, by which such rights were reserved to the Indians, &quot; &quot;158 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. reads, in the emergency part thereof, to which we have a right to refer for the purpose of determining the meaning of the act and the intention of the legislature, “Inasmuch as the safe-keeping and custody of the prisoners within the penitentiary depends upon the keeping in repair of the prison and its appliances, which are in many places in a state of decay, etc.,&amp;quot; plainly showing that what are to be kept in repair are the prison and appliances, and Webster&apos;s Dictionary defines appliance as the thing applied. Used in the connection it is in the act, it would mean things applied to the care and safe-keeping of the prisoners at the prison, and the words and other improvements as needed from time to time&amp;quot; would, in my opinion, cover all appliances used at the State peni- tentiary. This would not include articles belonging to the commis- sary department, such as flour, meat, etc. The act leaves the ex- penditure of the fund largely in the discretion of the Governor, and I am of the opinion that he has the authority to expend it for any appliances which in his judgment are needed, including arti- cles of bedding, household and kitchen furniture. I have examined the matter closely and am unable to arrive at any other conclusion, Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, February 4, 1904. HON. CHARLES S. MOORE, State Treasurer: DEAR Sir: Relative to your inquiry as to my construction of sections 3 and 7 of House Bill No. 41, being the inheritance tax law of 1903, page 51 of session laws, permit me to say that in my opinion the tax accrues, in the sense of the estate becoming liable therefor, at the death of the decedent donor, and that the same be- comes due and payable to the State within eight months thereafter. except in cases of unavoidable delay, as mentioned in said sections. When delay is caused by any devise, etc., mentioned in section 3. the tax is payable whenever the beneficiary comes into actual pos- session or enjoyment of the estate, devise or bequest, and if then paid, no interest is chargeable, but if not, interest must be paid at the rate of eight per cent per annum. When the tax is not &quot; &quot;&amp;quot;TY 1935 1 ТЭР REPORT. STATE OF OREGON, ATTORNEY-GENERAL&apos;S OFFICE, SALEM, September 30, 1904. To the Legislative Assembly of the State of Oregon: As required by law, I herewith submit my report for the bien- nial term ending September 30, 1904. This report covers about twenty-one months only, for the reason that no records or memoranda ever came into my possession show- ing the business and transactions of this office from September 30, 1902, to January 12, 1903, the date I assumed the duties of this office, and this report therefore commences with the last- named date. The office of Attorney-General was created by act of the legis- lative assembly of 1891, filed in the office of the Secretary of State February 21, 1891, and the following is a list of Attorney- Generals who have served the State since the creation of the office and their respective terms of service: Name, From what county. Term of service. Geo. E. Chamberlain. C. M. Idleman D. R. N. Blackburn. Andrew M. Crawford Linn Multnomah Linn Douglas. May 25, 1891, to January 11, 1N95. January 11, 1895, to January 6, 1899. January 6, 1899, to January 12, 193. January 12, 1903, to- &amp;gt; My assistants have been Mr. J. O. Watson, serving from Janu- ary 13, 1903, to March 16, 1903, who then resigned to take charge of a law office in Roseburg, Oregon; Mr. D. R. Parker, who served from March 17, 1903, to January 31, 1904, and then re- signed and opened an office in Condon, Oregon; and he was suc- ceeded by Mr. I. H: Van Winkle, who is still my assistant. At the date I had the honor to enter upon the discharge of the duties of this department I found several cases pending in the &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 183 Bill No. 27, creating the State Health Board, laws of 1903, regular session, page 84. Also section 2 provides that the State Board of Health shall have general supervision of the interests and life of the citizens of the State, make sanitary investigations, etc. The board may have considered holding the conference of health officers of the State the best means of collecting information re- quired by the statute, and if it did, I am doubtful of the authority of the auditor to review the board&apos;s decision. Also, it may have directed the conference as a means of disseminating information among the people, and it is by the latter part of section 3 above referred to expressly authorized and directed to disseminate infor- mation among the people by such means as it may direct. Where the board must exercise its judgment and discretion in matters of that kind, its judgment is final unless obviously not germane to the purposes of the act, and I am of the opinion that we can not say that renting rooms to hold the conference in is obviously foreign to the objects of the act. The conference itself might have been, and no doubt was, bene- ficial, and whether it was or not, it is germane to the purpose of the act, and in line therewith. That leaves only the question whether the judgment of the board that it could not be advan- tageously held at the office of the board, but required a larger place, is subject to review by the auditor, and I am of the opinion that it is not. And while it looks like extravagance, I am afraid a court would command the claim to be audited and paid, and so advise. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, May 27, 1904. To the Honorable State Land Board: GENTLEMEN: I have examined the second petition, being for interest, presented by John Adair, Jr., and find on examination of the records that the number of acres claimed by him, 1,713.82 acres, were never patented to the State, and I find by the records at Oregon City that nearly all, if not all, of the land has been sold &quot; &quot;82 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. not make it a part of the road laws, and the repeal of the chapter relating to roads and highways alone, into which the above sec- tion 3263 had been repeated as aforesaid did not repeal section 3263. The case of Stingle v. Nevel, 9 Or.,page 62, is a case where a certain act was passed in 1876, making it the duty oſ the sheriffs to collect school district taxes, when prior thereto it had been the duty of the school district clerk, which act of 1876 did not refer to the former law, to wit: Subdivision 2 of section 37, miscel- laneous laws, requiring district clerks to collect. Court held said section repealed by implication by said law of 1876. In 1878 the legislature amended said section 37, containing said subdivision 2, repealed by implication as aforesaid, by adding another sub- division, to wit: No. 9, and in making the amendment section 37 was set forth in full, and the subdivision 2, which had been re- pealed by implication, was republished in said section as amended. The court held that retention and republication of subdivision 2 was not re-enactment of the same, and that it did noi thereby be- come a part of the law. In its decision, the court says: “If, how- ever, the mere presence of subdivision 2 in the section as amended, is to be regarded as evidence of an intention to re-enact it, still this evidence is not conclusive, for a thing which is in the letter of a statute, is not within the statute itself unless it be within the intention of the makers. Also in 38 Cal. it is held that where a portion of a statute has been repealed, and the original statute was afterward amended in other particulars, and the repealed portion retained in the statute as amended, such retention under the circumstances was to be deemed a mere inadvertence. Section 4832, it is shown, was a republication of section 3263, in another place in the same bcok, as the author says, “for con- venience.” It is not claimed anywhere to be a part of the road law, but is conceded to be placed where it properly belongs, in the Military (ede as section 3263, and the legislature, when it repeale! the chapter relating to roads and highways, into which section 3263 had been for convenience only republished as number 4832, did not intend to repeal section 3263, or any part whatever of the Military Code, and the confusion has arisen from the fact that the authers did not cite section 3263 in the index of the road laws to show classes exempt from road taxes, instead of republishing &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 51 and protect the interests of the insurance agency from loss. Al- though the amount of the insurance to be maintained through the efforts of the adviser is not stated in this contract, he receives no pay unless a certain sum is carried by himself or some friend, effected at or prior to time of appointment, and shall continue to be paid in full. Briefly summarized, the advisers are to do certain acts and things to advance the interests of the company in securing a greater amount of insurance, and that of a desirable kind, to aid in advancing the interests of the company in every way except to personally solicit insurance, collect premiums therefor, or forward applications, and to receive compensation for the services per- formed. It can not be denied that a list of names of desirable per- sons for insurance, information as to who would be desirable agents to solicit insurance and collect premiums, and as to fraudu- lent claims, is valuable to any insurance company. Now is a person duly authorized by the company to acquire such information and furnish it to the company for a compensation “a person duly authorized to act on behalf of another??? If so, he is an agent for that purpose, and I think he is such a person and an agent of the company appointing him, and duly authorized to do any act within the scope of his authority. He is acting on behalf of the company when he is receiving the information. He does not acquire the information for himself, and the same is a part of the duties which devolve upon general agents, and the latter can appoint sub-agents to do a part or all the work, but if that is what is done, the adviser is still an agent of the company for certain purposes. And further, in the contracts under considera- tion, the companies approve the appointments and make the adviser an appointee of the company. I am unable to see any good reason why the so-called advisers should be exempt from taking out the license imposed upon life insurance agents hereinbefore referred to, and therefore respect- fully submit that such is my opinion. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &amp;gt; &quot; &quot;204 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. have not the required teaching experience they may receive an- other certificate of that grade, is to cover those cases where a teacher failed to secure a school, or through sickness or some other cause failed to teach the required length of time under the first certificate. Also the average required for a first-grade certificate is much higher than for a second or a third grade, and an appli- cant may fail at the first two examinations, but if above ninety per cent. in any branches would aparently be so efficient in those that another examination would seem superfluous. This would not apply so forcibly in the lower grades, for the reason that a lower average is required, and then the provision is only found in that portion of the statute relating to the issuance of first- grade certificates, and evidently was intended to apply to none other. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD. Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, August 3, 1904. Hon. CHARLES S. MOORE, State Treasurer: DEAR SIR: On examination of the abstract which you handed me yesterday, I find that the land described therein, the E. 1-2 of V. E. 1-7 of section 25, T. 19 S., R. 46 E. of W. M., containing eighty acres, was conveyed by the United States by patent to Doshey McDonald, March 17, 1899, no material defect appearing from the abstract. Page 2 of the abstract. On September 7, 1899, Doshey McDonald and Angus McDonald, her husband, conveyed said land to W. J. Van Lunburgh, Jr., for the sum of $1,500. Though the name of the grantee appears as Van Limburgh in the habendum clause of the deed, this would not be material, but would be treated as a clerical error, unless such is his real name, in which case the fact should be shown by affidavit of some one who knows the facts of his own knowledge Page 3 of the abstract. W. J. Van Lunburgh, Jr., gave a mortgage to the Bank of Ontario on the land described in the abstract, December 5, 1899. which still remains a lien upon the land. Page 4 of the abstract. September 29, 1900, W. J. Van Lunburgh, Jr., gave another &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 131 “Such commission shall take steps immediately to encourage, se- cure, and promote a full and complete exhibition of the arts, in- dustries, manufactures, and products of the river, soil, mines, for- ests, and sea in said City of Portland, and to carry out the pro- visions of the act.” The powers conferred upon said commission by said subdivision, and hy all the provisions of the act, are general in their terms; not once in the act has the legislature attempted to particularly define the powers and duties of the commission ; but in every instance confers a general power to carry out the pur- poses for which it was created. The matter of details is left entirely to the commission; such an act cannot be technically construed. To so construe it would embarrass the commission in prosecuting their work of promoting the exposition, and be detrimental to its success. What steps are necessary to encourage, secure, and promote a full and complete exhibition must be to a great extent, if not en- tirely, left to the commission, which is composed of eleven men chosen by the Governor of the State of Oregon as specially fitted to perform the duty imposed upon them. I am therefore of the opinion that the act must be liberally con- strued. That a reasonable amount of advertising is necessary and proper to further the interests of the exposition will be readily conceded, and the manner thereof is to be determined by the com- mission. The claim under consideration, while it requests an ap- propriation from Congress in aid of the exposition, also adver- tises it in places which are liable to bring valuable returns, and it is, in my opinion, an expense the commission has a right to incur, and is undoubtedly within the purview of the act. The question as to whether the commission can send a represen- tative to the National Congress, and the legislatures of the several States to urge an appropriation in aid of the fair, is not involved in the consideration of this claim, and I have other matters of great importance to the State under consideration, and can not give the time requisite to examine it thoroughly, but will do so soon, if necessary.

It is in lieu of the funds provided by the act of 1882, appropriating $2,500 annually, and the act of 1889, appropriating $5,000 annually, and it may be used in paying current expenses, salaries of professors and in- structors, and wages of employees, making additions to the library and apparatus, for buildings, improvements, and repairs, and for the purchase of additional land for the use of said college. In the face of these statutes it can not be questioned that a fund is provided for the payment of current expenses, and other debts and liabilities of said municipal corporation. Having shown that the college is a municipal corporation, and must pay its own bills, and that the State has provided a fund for the purpose, the prin- cipal question arises, to wit: How is this fund to be applied to the payment of the claims against the corporation, and to its use and benefit? In order to solve this problem, we must examine all the statutes in force, and those which have been repealed, to ascertain the intent of the legislature. Section 7 of the law of 1885, page 11, provides, “That all funds applicable by law to the support of the State Agricultural College shall be drawn by warrants issued by the Secretary of State * * on the written request of the board of regents, countersigned by the secretary.&quot; This has never been repealed, hence is still in force. The law of 1882, page 26, provides for an annual appropri- aticn ef $2,500, and section 2 provides that it should be drawn one- third on the first day of December, one-third on the first day of March, and one-third on the first day of June, annually. The manner of drawing was not changed. Said act was not repeale: by the act of 1901. Section 3 of the act of 1889, page 8, provides an annual appropriation of $5,000 for the support of the college, and the act appropriates $30,000 for buying land and the erection and equipment of necessary buildings, and section 6 provides ** That the said sums of money so appropriated shall be expended by and under the supervision and control of the board of regents of the State Agricultural College, for the purposes for which the same are l:ereby appropriated.” No change is made in the manner . of drawing the same from the State Treasury. Said section 2, making an appropriation, was repealed by the &apos; &quot;4 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. Supreme and Circuit Courts of this State in which the State of Oregon was interested, which cases, with those which have since arisen, involving public interests, are hereinafter particularly men- tioned. CORRESPONDENCE. The correspondence of this office during the period covered by this report has been mainly of an official nature. County and city officers from all over the State write letters asking for opinions on various subjects, and while the statute does not expressly provide that this department shall act as the legal adviser of such officials, we have endeavored to answer all such communications, but find that it adds an immense amount of work to the regular duties of the office. Such communications are received almost daily and can not be ignored without creating great dissatisfaction. Very few cities have a city attorney, and prosecuting attorney districts com- prise several counties, and prosecuting attorneys usually attend to criminal business only, and city and county officials consider that they have the right to consult the Attorney-General on mat- ters relating to public interests in their jurisdictions. Therefore we think it best to continue the practice of attending to all such communications. Replies to this class of communications fill over . seven hundred pages of our letter books, but the most of them relating to matters pertaining to some particular sections of the State cnly, we have not deemed them of sufficient importance to embody in this report, although many of them relate to matters of grave importance to the people of the particular section of the State. SCHOOL BONDS. By act of the legislative assembly, regular session, 1903. the State Land Bcard was authorized to invest any surplus of the irreducible school fund or any other State funds in bonds and warrants issued by the various school districts within the State of Oregon, and we have examined the records, approved the same, and advised the purchase of school bonds during the time covered by this report as follows: 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 5 Date.

Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, May 26, 1903. Hon. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: Dear Sir: In reply to yours of this date by Mr. Wrightman as to the course which should be adopted relative to corporations which reduce their capital stock prior to the license law going into effect, and which corporation failed to file in your office any certi- fied copy of the resolutions of stockholders, or their evidence of such reduction of the capital stock of the corporation, I would advise that they file a certified copy of the resolutions, or other proceed- ings so reducing the capital stock, and if such resolution shows the capital stock to have been so reduced prior to the date of the taking effect of the late corporation law, that they be not required to pay the license fee of five dollars, and no other fee for the filing of the same than they would have been required to pay before the passage of said act. However, if they do not file such certified copy, the license fee will have to be regulated by the amount of capital stock represented by the original articles of incorporation. It was not necessary, under section 5070, prior to its being repealed, for a corporation increasing or decreasing its capital stock to certify the same to the Secretary of State. After the amendment, it be- came necessary to do so, and to pay a fee of five collars, and I doubt very much whether a corporation which has already reduced its capital stock before this amendment became effective, can be charged five dollars for so doing. They are lawful corporations, entitled to do business with their reduced capital prior to such amendment, and the only thing necessary for the corporation al- Att&apos;y Gen. -7 &quot; &quot;1 &quot; &quot;1-10 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. construction of sections 3310 and 3311 would indicate that interest was to be paid only where land was paid for.

Chamber of Commerce, Portland, Oregon: CENTLEMEN : Relative to the question propounded by letter of your secretary of the 4th instant, as to “Whether the State can condemn lands for the benefit of the Federal Government,” and stating that the question sought to be brought out is, “Whether the State of Oregon can legally grant a right of way to the Federal Government for the use of the Celilo Canal ;&apos;&apos; permit me to say that if the State was the owner in fee of the title of the lands through which the proposed canal is to be dug, I would not hesti- tate to answer in the affirmative, but as I understand the situation, the title is all, or nearly all, in private individuals. Section 18 of the bill of rights, Oregon Constitution, provides that “Private property shall not be taken for public use * * with- out just compensation first assessed and tendered.&amp;quot; From the fact that the canal would connect the waters of the Upper and Lower Columbia River in such a way as to open up a highway for the transportation of the products of at least a portion of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana, we will assume that the same is for a public use, within the meaning of the constitution; and under the foregoing provision thereof, there can be no doubt that the State has power by appropriate legislation to condemn the right of way, and build the canal. It is situate wholly within the boundaries of the State, and the fact that it would be a benefit to the inhabitants of other States would not restrict our State in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, when the particular property is taken for a public use, ben- efitting the people of this State.

SALEM, Oregon, June 18, 1903. DR. WOODS HUTCHINSON, State Health Officer, Portland, Oregon: DEAR Sır: Relative to your inquiry of the 14th instant as to whether your board has the authority to designate the point of exit of a city sewer, prior to the construction of the sewer, when you consider the point selected by the city as detrimental, permit me to say that the act creating the Board of Health confers no such authority upon the board. Section 3 of the act, laws of 1903, page 83, confers upon the board authority to make and enforce such quarantine regulations as seem best for the preservation of the public health, and section 10 of the act provides that “In cities, districts, and places having no local board of health, or in case the sanitary laws or regulations in places where boards of health. or health officers exist, should be inoperative, the State Board of Health shall have power and authority to order nuisances, or any cause of any special disease, or mortality to be abated and re- moved.” The board of health has power to act upon any particular thing dangerous to public health, and cause it to be removed, but unless a thing is dangerous in itself to public health, they can not assume in advance that it would be. A sewer is necessary to the public health in a city, and the board cannot assume in advance that the exit will be a nuisance per se without reference to the manner in which it may be guarded. A pipe may be run to the middle of the river, and the discharge be in such a manner that no nuisance will be created, and I am of the opinion that unless an act must necessarily result in a nuisance per se, the board cannot act upon it in advance, but must wait until a nuisance is in fact created. Yours respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 21, 1903. Hon. J. W. MORROW, State Land Agent: Dear Sir: In accordance with your request of some time ago, I have endeavored to make a brief of the land laws of the State of Oregon. &quot; &apos;200 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. pealed so far as they conflict with this act.&quot; Therefore all acts previously existing relative to salaries of prosecuting attorneys in said First Judicial District were expressly repealed, and the salaries were fixed at $2,000 and $1,500 per annum respectively. At the special session of the Oregon Legislature before referred to, an act was duly passed amending section 2927 of B. &amp;amp; C. Anno- tated Codes and Statutes of Oregon, and said section as amended contains the following clause: “The district attorneys of the several judicial districts of this State, during their continuance in office, shall be entitled to receive from the State Treasury, paya- ble quarterly, as are salaries of other State officers, as full compen- sation for their services, the following named annual salaries : First Judicial District, $3,000.&quot; The words &quot;First Judicial Dis- trict, $3,000,” were originally contained in said section 2927, and are that portion thereof which was repealed by said section 10 of the act of 1903, regular session, creating two prosecuting attor- ney districts in said judicial district. The act of the special session, page 32, session laws thereof, amending said section 2927, retains that portion of said section which had been repealed. The question is, therefore, did the amending act by retaining such repealed portion have the effect of re-enacting the same and re- pealing by implication that portion of the act creating the two prosecuting districts, which relates to salaries? The amendments made in said section 2927 were to provide the amount of salary which should be paid by certain district attorneys to their depu- ties, thus assuring to such deputies a reasonable salary and not leaving it to the district attorney to say how much he would pay them. The part referring to the First Judicial District was not changed, but was republished, and no reference was made to the act of the regular session repealing such portion of the section. In the case of Pond v. Haddox, 38 Cal. 574, the court laid down the rule that where a portion of a statute had been repealed, and the original statute afterwards amended, in other particulars, and the repealed portion retained in the statute as amended, such re- tention under the circumstances was to be deemed a mere inad- vertence, and the same rule was adopted by our Supreme Court in the case of Stingle 1. Nevel, 9 Or. 62, and the latter case further holds that where a constitutional provision requires an amendment to be made by publishing the act or section amended, at full length, &apos; &quot;208 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. make it public would be in violation of the intent of the act. You can put such information in your report in a generai way as you think necessary to enable the legislature to act intelligently, giving no names or other data which would injure the person furnishing the information, or which would be a violation of your promises. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD. Attorney-General, OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, September 6, 1901. Hon. &amp;quot;. J. MOORE, District Attorney for Klamath and Luke (&apos;outies, Lakerieu&apos;, Oregon: DEJR Sir: Replying to yours of the 31st ultimo requesting my opinion as to “when lands covered by lieu selections become taxa- ble.” permit me to say that in my opinion all government and State lands are assessable as soon as the applicant has done every- thing, including payment, to entitle him to a patent from the gov- ernment or the State. Timber lands, homesteads, pre-emptions, desert land entries, etc., when final proof and payment are made and the applicant has received the receiver&apos;s final receipt, are tax- able whether or not patent has issued. When lieu selections are made, while I am unable to find a case squarely in point, I can sen no reason why the same rule does not apply, and, applying it, they can be assessed as soon as the final receipt has been issued by the receiver, or in case he issues none, as soon as the applicant has done everything to entitle him to a patent. The applicant must post notice on the land and publish notice, etc. When he has done all these things and filed his deed to the land surrendered an ! abstract of title, and furnished proof of posting, etc., and the land officials announce that he has done all the law requires of him, in- cluding payment of fees, then the land can, in my opinion, be as- sessed. In the case of the 0. &amp;amp; C. R. R. Co. 1. Lane County, 23 Or. Supreme Court reports, at page 390, the court announces the rule that under the land grant to the road, “Lands earned and the selected indemnity lands to which the plaintiff is entitled to re- ceive a patent are subject to taxation the same as the lands for which it has received a patent.&amp;quot; &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 103 General, and the proof certified by him does not govern your office in issuing the warrants, but the time the voucher is received in your office. As to the proper course to adopt should any claims be presented after the appropriation is exhausted, I would advise that it is your duty to allow the claims upon proper vouchers being present- ed, and issue to the claimant a certificate as evidence of such allow- ance under section 2398 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. The amount is a debt due the claimant from the State of Oregon as soon as the proper proofs have been presented to the Adjutant-General, and was in- curred in pursuance of authority of law, and the appropriation has been exhausted; therefore the claim should be audited, certifi- cate issued, and the next legislature be asked to appropriate funds with which to pay the claims the same as any other indebtedness against the State, for which no appropriation is made. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 10, 1903. Hon. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Relative to the inquiry of Henry E. Reed, of June 6, 1903, handed me for my opinion, I would say: That the Lewis and Clark Centennial and American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair, is a private corporation, and must pay the annual license fee, unless it comes within some of the exceptions mentioned in House Bill No. 2, laws of 1903, page 39. Section 5 of said act provides for an annual license fee for all corporations formed or organized under, by or pursuant to the laws of this State, whether existing at the time of the passage of the act, or thereafter created; such fee to be graded in proportion to the amount of the capital stock of the corporation, and said section also provides that it shall not apply to any corporation formed or organized for any educational, literary, scientific, or charitable purpose; and also except fire and marine, life, accident, plate glass and steam boiler insurance companies, and surety companies; there are no other exceptions, and unless the first- mentioned corpora- &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 189 are which I will not take the time to review, but the rule is manifestly es. tablished by great weight of authority that a statute is remedial. the object of which is mainly beneficent. The main object of the two sections last mentioned is to correct errors which may be made in the execution of deeds on the part of the State and to refuni! money received by the State for the sale of lands it did not own, and I am of the opinion that their remedial character can not be questioned, and being remedial, they must be liberally construeil Endlich on Construction of Statutes, section 107, page 142, says such statutes are to be liberally construed “to carry out the pur- pose of the enactment, suppress the mischief, and advance the remedy contemplated by the legislature; * * they * to be construed &apos;giving the words * * the largest, the fullest, anzi most extensive meaning of which they are susceptible.&apos; The ob- ject of this kind of statutes being to cure a weakness in the old! law, to supply an omission, to enforce a right, or to redress a wrong, it is reasonable to suppose that the legislature intended to do so as effectually, broadly, and completely, as the language used. when understood in its most extensive significance, would indicate.” Applying this rule to the statute under consideration, the wer:) “where in the sentence “where lands have been sold which the board could not and can not convey to the purchaser, etc,” means that whenever the condition occurs that the board has sold lands to which it could not and can not convey title, etc. The condition may have already occurred, and it may hereafter occur, but when that condition exists, then the board must refund, the purchaser complying with the statute to make the necessary proof and execute a quit claim deed to the State of what right or interest he may have acquired. The Century Dictionary defines the word “where&amp;quot; to have various meanings dependent upon the manner of its use, and gives it as meaning “in which position, situation, or circum- stance.&amp;quot; To construe it in the statute to mean place, would be ridiculously absurd, but to construe it as meaning when the cir- cumstances are such that lands have been sold which the board? could not and can not convey, etc., the money shall be refunder?, gives it an equitable construction, and makes it harmonious with the rest of the statute, and such, I think, was the meaning the legislature intended. There is nothing in the act which necessarily appears to restrict the same to past transactions, but the worils &quot; &apos;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 121 amount is not sufficient. The excess of claims must wait until the legislature appropriates more money, and in this case the appro- priation being the recognition of the claim, there is no power to audit in excess of the appropriation. My opinion of the 5th ultimo, in which without a careful examination of this point, I said “The claim should be audited, certificate issued, and the next legislature asked to appropriate funds,&quot; is hereby modified to harmonize here- with. Yours respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, July 21, 1903. Hox. G. G. BROWN, Clerk State Land Board: DEAR Sir: Relative to the inquiry of the board propounded in yours of the 16th instant, as to whether the last four lines of sec- tion 4 of House Bill No. 154, on page 309, session laws of 1903, make it mandatory on the board to sell the school lands mentioned therein, and particularly directing my attention to the title of the act, and that it only refers to indemnity school land, permit me to say that I have examined the act with some care, and have come to the conclusion that the word “shall” in the last clause of section 4 of said act, and contained in the lines you mention, is mandatory, and that under that clause the board would have no discretion, but must sell to the first legal applicant who offers the price, $2.50 per acre. for State lands, with the exception mentioned, provided the provisions of said section of the act are germane to the title. The title reads “An act providing for the selection of indemnity school land, and governing the sale of the same, and fixing the price thereof.&quot; Section 1 of the act provides for the selection of in- demnity school lands, and sections 2 and 3 provide for the sale and price: all of which is embraced in the title. Then comes section 4. providing that all school lands in sections 16 and 36 hereafter sur- veyed, shall be offered to the highest bidder for three months, and then sold to the applicant for $2.50 per acre, and then that “All school lands now surveyed and owned by the State, except those &apos; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 193 OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 18, 1904. Hon. B. F. MULKEY, President of Southern Oregon State Normal School, Ashland. Oregon. DEAR SIR: Relative to yours of the 16th instant as to whether &apos;the directors of Belleview School District can contract with the Southern Oregon State Normal School to furnish teachers for the district, permit me to say that in my opinion the directors of the district can employ teachers who are attending the normal school, said teachers holding certificates from the county school superin- tendent. The district board can enter into contracts with as many teachers as they choose, and if the general management is under the faculty of the normal, it will not, in my opinion, detract from their efficiency. The manner of conducting the school, and es- pecially the employment of teachers, lies with the directors, and! the voters of the district can not by ballot or otherwise add to their power, but their action only show&apos;s such to be the desire of the district. As long as duly licensed teachers are employed, I am of the opinion that the plan outlined in your letter can be sub- stantially carried out. To permit the directors to use the district school money, duly licensed teachers must be employed. I here- with enclose a copy of my opinion to the Governor upon that point, rendered the 4th instant, which I think is self-explanatory. If I can be of any further service, you will please command mº. Very respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 18, 1904. J. W. BAKER, State Game Warden, Cottage Grove, Oregon: DEAR Sir: Replying to yours of the 17th instant, asking for an opinion as to the validity of the China Pheasant law (so-called), the same being House Bill No. 41, special session, 1903, page 17, general laws, permit me to say that said bill passed both houses of the legislature, December 23, and was filed in the office of the Secretary of State December 24, 1903. The Journal of the Att&apos;y Gen.—13 &quot; &apos;142 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 356, acts of the Legislatures of Maryland, California, and Massa- chusetts, providing for the appropriation of lands for the necessary use of the General Government, were severally sustained. In Trombly 1. Humphrey, 23 Mich. 471, a similar act of the legisla- ture of Michigan was held invalid.The weight of authority, there- fore. is greatly in favor of the existence of such a power in the States, and, without having given to the subject so full a consider ation as we might have done had the eminent counsel for the plaintiff not tacitly conceded it, we are of the opinion that the power does exist in the States.&quot; Also in the case of Lancy 1. King Co. 15 Wash. 9, it is held &quot;That title to a public improvement when it is completed, is to be conveyed to the United States, will not prevent the State from exercising its power of eminent domain to acquire the necessary lani upon which to construct it.&quot; In re League Island, 1 Brew. 524, it is held that the United States is not as to one of the States a foreign corporation, and that a State may take land for a national public use, and give it to the General Government. The Oregon Constitution provides that the taking must be for a public use, and there must be just compensation to the owner. The constitutional requirement is complied with when it is shown to be a public use, and compensation provided. The proposed canal, although to be constructed by the United States, is not for its sole use and benefit, but for the use of everybody as a great public highway, and if controlled by the General Govern ment, such control is only to regulate the use for the public good. Its essential character as a local public improvement for the people, or a great proportion of the people of the State of Oregon, directly connecting the two most thickly populated sections of the State by a continuous highway, can not be changed or taken away by the fact that the work may be of value to other States as a means of transportation, and to the General Government as an aid to inter- state commerce. The objection urged in the Michigan case, that there is no necessity for the exercise of eminent domain, for the authority of the National Government is ample for the supply of its own needs, is fully answered by the fact that the proposed improve. ment is necessary for the use of the people of Oregon, and the eminent domain being founded on necessity, when the necessity ex- ists, the right exists. &apos; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 173 act of the board in executing said satisfaction. The board had no authority to issue the same, and the act itself being illegal the board cannot ratify it. Further, the mortgage had ceased to exist prior to the execution of the satisfaction, it having been foreclosed and sale confirmed. Assuming the foreclosure proceedings to have been regular, the title to the premises is in the State, and the board has no authority to compromise the pending suit and give a deed as a part of the compromise. It can, however, sell the land for an adequate price to the de- fendant or any other person, and if sold to the defendant, it would necessarily terminate the suit. The board is authorized to sell the same on the best terms obtainable; section 3321, B &amp;amp; C. Comp. ; but must secure an adequate price. That is, the price must not be so low that it would appear to be a fraud on the State. The amount of the original loan was $350.00, made September 18, 1876. The amount due the State, with interest and costs at the date of the foreclosure sale, September 20, 1890, was $809.30, and the amount due March 20, 1904, is $1,902.12. The value of the land embraced in said mortgage and bid in by the State is at the present time, as I am informed, sufficient to satisfy the State&apos;s demands, two thousand dollars being the lowest estimate I have received, and some place it at twenty-five hundred dollars. The place consists of about two hundred and thirty acres situate on Eagle Creek, and within one-half mile of the 0. W. P. &amp;amp; Ry. Co.&apos;s electric railway leading from Portland to Cazedero, and about twenty-four miles from Portland. Eighty acres can be put in cul- tivation at a very small expense. There are about twenty-five acres of timber suitable for piling, and big trees scattered over the balance, not very densely timbered. Eagle Creek running through the same is large enough to float the timber to Portland market. I am of the opinion that a sale for less than fifteen hundred dollars would not be advisable. I am also of the opinion that the $200 received by the board for the satisfaction of mortgage before men- tioned will have to be returned to the person showing himself en- titled thereto. The land is, I am informed, good agricultural land when cleared, and the timber on that part which is timbered will sell for enough to pay for clearing. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &quot;1 &quot; &quot;[ 10 ] any question submitted to him in which the state may have an interest and shall keep in proper books copies of all his opinions and official proceedings, etc. In pursuance of this statute and at the solicitation of state officers, commissioners and district attorneys throughout the state, there has been rendered during the two years last past 61 opinions, which have been duly recorded and which com- prises about 500 folios. These opinions have been chietly upon the interpretations of statutes or on the construction of the constitution, and many of them have involved intricate and important questions that have required much research and care in preparation. I do not deem it necessary to go into detail regarding these opinions, but may say that in any instance in which the ques- tion involved in any opinion has been brought before the supreme court, the position taken by this office has been affirmed. The preparation and trial of these cases and the rendering of the opinions have not constituted the entire work of this department. In the preparation of the cases for final disposi- tion in the supreme court over two hundred pages of printed briefs have been prepared, numerous letters have been written in answer to inquiries, contracts, leases and forms for state use have been drawn, including the necessary consultation with state officials and district attorneys. It may be discerned from the foregoing and the semiannual report filed herein two years since, that this departinent of the state has during this term of office tried more than one hun- dred cases, embracing all the courts from the state circuit court to the United States court of appeals, prepared more than 300 pages of printed brief for the trial of causes in the appellate courts, prepared all the pleadings and tried these cases in the circuit courts, written 95 opinions, embracing over 1,000 folios, and upon most intricate and complicated questions of law, besides personally supervising and dispatching the correspondence and other duties necessarily attendant upon the office. NEEDS OF THE OFFICE, There has been a constant increase in the amount of business transacted in this department since its creation, and especially has this been perceptible during the time covered by this semi- annual report. This has not been occasioned by reason of ex- tended powers or newly interposed duties resulting from legis- lative enactment, but from the voluntary performance of such acts as should be prescribed and designated by law as a part of the duties of the office. If all the civil cases in any and all the courts in which the &quot; &apos;56 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. per cent. of the legal voters, or by the legislative assembly as other bills are enacted. Referendum petitions shall be filed with the Secretary of State not more than ninety days after the final ad- journment of the session of the legislative assembly which passed the bill on which the referendum is demanded.&quot; The legislative assembly did not refer the bill to the people, but instead thereof declared an emergency to exist, and that the act should go into effect on its approval by the Governor. The Governor, under the provisions of section 15 of article 5 of the constitution, had five days after the adjournment of the legislature to consider the bill and veto the same, but did not do so, and on the 20th ultimo filed it with the Secretary of State without taking any action thereon. When he so filed the bill, it was out of his control, and his authority over it ceased. In the case of Briggs v. McBride, 17 Or. 640, our Supreme Court says: “An act which passes both houses of the legislature, and which contains an emergency clanse, followed by the words that the same shall take effect, and be in force from and after its approval by the Governor, but which the Governor never approves, but vetoes, and the same is duly passed by both houses by the necessary majorities, notwithstanding the veto, takes effect, and is in force from and after its passage, and that such an act takes effect when the law-making power has done every act or thing necessary to its complete enactment as a law.” Applying the same principle to the act under consideration, the emergency clause thereof has the same effect as though the bill had been signed by the Governor, and would go into effect upon filing with the Secretary of State, provided the emergency clause is sufficient. The question then arises as to whether the legislature has the power to put a law of this kind into immediate force and effect, under the referendum provisions of section 1, as amended, and section 28 of article 4 of the constitution hereinbefore set forth. In construing the same, the two provisions must be read to- gether, and such a construction given as will give force and effect to all the provisions of each section, and as far as possible har- monize them. State 1. Finnerud, 7 S. D. 237, Cohen v. Wright, 22 Cal. 293, People v. Gerke, 5 Cal. 381, &apos; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 123 Under section 3299 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. the authority is conferred upon the board to make rules for the transaction of business under the act, and the most important business under the act is the sale of the school lands of the State, and I believe the board has the authority to prescribe such rules for ascertaining the value of the lands, and for their sale, as it may deem expedient, including sale by bids or public auction, provided such rules as may be adopted do not conflict with the laws or constitution of this State, or of the United States.

VAN DUSEN, Master Fish Warden, Astoria, Oregon: DEAR SIR: Replying to yours of the 17th instant as to whether a person who has taken out a license as a canner, and adds a cold!- storage plant, and then sends the larger fish to the cold storage. and cans the balance, must take out a license for cold storage also, when all the fish he expects to handle will not exceed the amount he is entitled to handle under the first or canner&apos;s license, permit me to say that one clause of section 3 of the act of 1903, page 220, reads: “When more than one cannery or plant is operated by the same person, firm, or corporation, each shall be licensed separately. and according to its class.&amp;quot; Section 4 provides that &amp;quot;Any firm, person, or corporation en- , gaged in the business of buying, selling, packing, preserving, or otherwise dealing in salmon, fish, or sturgeon, other than canners thereof, as provided in this act,” shall take out a license as such dealer. The wording of section 3 leaves no doubt but that if a person, firm or corporation, operated two canneries, a license must be taken out for each. The language is more than one cannery, or plant, and the word plant may apply to a plant other than a can- nery, but if it does not, certainly if two canneries cannot be oper. ated jointly under one license, it is much more improbable that the legislature intended that a cannery and a preserving plant should &quot; &quot;16 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. for the larceny of a mare, and being convicted, appealed to the Supreme Court, which court heard the case on the 15th day of October, 1902, at Salem, and on the 3rd day of November, 1902, affirmed the judgment of the trial court.

DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR Sir: I have, in accordance with your request of the 4th instant, examined the questions submitted by the Adjutant-General in his letter of date 29th ultimo relative to whether the money ap- propriated by House Bill 85, for compensating volunteers in the Indian Wars of 1855 and 1856, shall be disbursed pro rata among all who file claims under the act, which would necessitate with- holding all disbursements until all claims are filed, or whether they should be paid in full, as they are filed, and if so, whether as filed in the office of the Adjutant-General, or in your office, and in case the appropriation is not sufficient to pay all claims, whether those which may be filed in your office after the appropriation shall be exhausted, shall be audited, and a certificate issued therefor. The act, in the preamble thereof, acknowledges an indebtedness on the part of the State to the volunteers who served in the Indian Wars of 1855 and 1856. Section 1 of the act appropriates out of the general fund in the treasury the sum of $100,000, or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay such indebtedness. Section 3 of the act provides that the Adjutant-General shall prepare, certi- fy, and file with the Secretary of State, proper vouchers showing the amount payable to the claimant under the provisions of the act, thereupon the Secretary of State shall issue his warrant for the amount found due the claimant. The act assumes that the $100,000 appropriation will be sufficient to pay all claims in full, and the Secretary of State is required to issue his warrant to a claimant whenever there is presented to him the proper voucher therefor. I find no warrant of law for your declining to issue a warrant on the Treasurer when such voucher is received by you, and for the full amount thereof. You have no authority to wait until all claims are in, and there is no date fixed in the bill within which claims must be presented; therefore it is my opinion that you should draw a warrant on the Treasurer of this State in favor of the claimant for the full amount due him whenever you receive the proper voucher duly certified by the Adjutant-General, showing the amount due such claimant.

CHAMBERLAIN, Governor of the State of Oregon: DEAR SIR: Yours of the 10th instant, inclosing the letter of Mr. Franklin L. Griffith, submitted the question as to whether the State in its sovereign capacity can, by its Attorney-General, on relation of another, institute a suit to abate, enjoin, or restrain a public nuisance. It is a difficult question to answer, as the law de- fining the duties of the Attorney-General is somewhat vague. Section 2421, among other things, says: “He (the Attorney- General) shall appear, prosecute or defend for the State all suits, causes or proceedings in the Supreme Court in which the State is a party or interested; and he shall, when requested by any State Board, or board of trustees, or by the Governor, or Secretary of State, or the State Treasurer, appear, prosecute, or defend any action, suit, cause, or proceeding in any court in which the State is a party or interested.” It is therefore made his duty to rep- resent the State in all matters in the Supreme Court, and in other courts when requested by the proper parties; and your question involves the point as to whether the State has the right to bring the suit if the Attorney-General be directed to do so. The doctrine is announced in Vol. 3, 2nd Edition of American and English Encyclopedia of Law as follows: “In England the Attorney-General, as the chief law officer of the Crown, has the right, ex officio, to file an information quo warranto, to enter a nolle prosequi and to institute proceedings to restrain and abate public nuisances and purprestures. Atty-Gen. v. Richards, 2 Anstr. 603; Atty.-Gen. v. Brown, 1 Swanst. 265.

The money never having been repaid, nor any part there- of, nor any interest thereon, and the mortgage having almost be- come barred by the statute of limitations, this suit is commenced to foreclose the mortgage and thus protect the common school fund. The case has not yet been heard, and is now pending in the circuit court for Marion County. &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 63 OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, March 5, 1903. Hon. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Referring to your recent inquiry as to whether the charter of the Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York is suffi- cient to permit it to do a surety business under the laws of Ore- yon, permit me to say that after an examination of the same, and of the laws of New York under which the same was granted, I am of the opinion that the provisions of the charter are sufficient to comply with our statutes upon the same subject, and empowers the company to do business in this State. I do not deem it neces- sary to set forth the reasons for such opinion, but will state that I have examined the statutes carefully. Page 193, laws of 1899, section 2, and B. &amp;amp; C. Codes, section 3758, says the Secretary shall issue a certificate to such company, authorizing it to do business upon due proof being furnished of its qualifications under the act, and among them are that the capital of $250,000 be paid up and that it has assets of at least $500,000. The code reads $300,000, but the original law reads $500,000. I would suggest that due proof would be the certificate of the In- surance Commissioner as to those facts, but as these are ques- tions of fact, you are the one to judge of the sufficiency of proof of the same. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. 2 OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, March 5, 1903 MR. JOSEPH HEILNER, Baker City, Oregon: DEAR SIR: Referring to your favor of the 3rd instant, in which : you desire my opinion as to when the Baker City Charter Bill went into effect, permit me to say that the same, in my opinion, took effect when it was filed with the Secretary of State, to wit: February 19, 1903. The bill in question passed the House January 30, 1903, and the Senate on February 6, 1903; was received in the Executive &quot; &quot;170 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. Therefore it seems that the terms of the road supervisors elected in 1902 expired in January, 1904, and that the several county courts should have appointed successors at the January, 1904, terms of said courts. If, however, they fail to do so, the super- visors will, in my opinion, hold until their successors are duly ap- pointed and qualified. Supervisors appointed in January, 1904, will hold one year and until their successors are appointed and qualified. House Bill No. 280, 1903, page 282 of laws of that year, section 68. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, March 15, 1904. HIon. G. G. BROWN, Clerk of State Land Board: DEAR SIR: Relative to your inquiry of the 14th instant as to whether lands to which the State has acquired title through fore- closure proceedings and then resold, receiving a part of the pur- chase price in cash and given a certificate of purchase to the pur- chaser, promising a deed as soon as the balance is paid, are assess- able; permit me to say that in my opinion they are not, until the full amount of the purchase price is paid. Section 3037, B. &amp;amp; C. Code, provides that all property, real and personal, within this State not expressly cxempt therefrom shall be subject to taxation in the manner provided by law. All property, real and personal, of the United States is exempt from taxation, session laws of 1903, page 216, it is also exempt from assessment for purposes of tax- ation. If the statute read that all public property, or all property used for public uses should be exempt from taxation, the lands contracted to be sold might be assessed, not being used for any pub- lic use; but our statute reads that all property of the State shall be exempt. Therefore the question is whether the property is the property of the State. The rule as to government land is that when a purchaser from the United States, a grant claimant, a home- &quot; &apos;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 79 never extended where the existence of the corporation, or the ex- ercise of its powers are prejudicial to their interests or repugnant to their powers.&quot; The doctrine that a legislature can impose upon foreign corpora- tions such terms as it may choose is held in many decisions, and may be considered settled. The proposition is held and very ably discussed in Liverpool Insurance Co. v. Massachusetts, 10 Wall. 566. The last question as to whether the notice of dissolution will be required of corporations which have dissolved prior to the act going into effect, answers itself. If a corporation is already dis- solved, there is no one to require the dissolution notice from, as dissolution is an accomplished fact. You can require dissolution notices only from corporations which dissolve after the act takes effect. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, April 21, 1903. Hen. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Relative to your inquiry of the 3rd instant as to whether the sum appropriated by House Bill No. 368. session laws 1903, page 305, “For the payment of the expenses of the State Biologist of the State of Oregon, incurred in the work of planting and propagating Eastern oysters, Eastern lobsters, and other food fish and animals, introduced into the State of Oregon by the United States Government, and in the listing and describing the birds of the State, and in the biological examination of water sup- plies.” is available for the payment of expenses incurred by the State Biologist prior to the date the act takes effect, I call your attention to the title of the act, which reads as follows: “An act making appropriation for the payment of certain specified claims against the State of Oregon, and for the purposes hereinafter specifically set forth, and particularly enumerated.&quot; Section 1 makes the appropriation of one thousand dollars, using the lan- guage above quoted.

Code, which provides for the incorporating of religious, charitable, and educational corporations. Failing to come within the provisions of this chapter, in my opinion, it should be required to pay the corporation tax required by the law enacted by the Legislative Assembly in 1903, page 39 of the general laws of that year, providing for taxing private corporations. According to the last-mentioned law, all corporations are subject to tax, except- ing those formed for educational, literary, scientific, religious, or charitable purposes, and those must be organized according to the provisions of chapter 6 of article 41 above referred to. Respectfully submitted, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. By I. H. VAN WINKLE, Assistant. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 10, 1904. Hon. J. H. ACKERMAN, Superintendent of Public Instruction: DEAR SIR: In accordance with your request for my opinion. of the 8th instant, on the following questions: “Is a person en- titled to vote at any school meeting or election in June, 1904, who has property in the district assessed by the assessor in May or June, 1904; provided, such person has all the other qualifications for a voter at such meeting or election ?” permit me to say that I am of the opinion such a person is entitled to vote at such school meeting or election. Section 46 of Oregon school laws, 1903, page 37, provides that “Any citizen of this State, male or female, who is 21 years of age, and has resided in the district thirty days immediately preceding the meeting or election, and has property in the district, as shown by the last county assessment, and not assessed by the sheriff, on which he or she is liable or subject to pay a tax, shall be entitled to vote at any school meeting or election in said district.” In my opinion, the assessment for the current year is the last county as- sessment, as far as the particular person is concerned who has been assessed by the assessor for that year, and the fact that the assess- &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 157 judge, with the evidence you have, for further investigation, and if he reverses his former decision, relieve the party from payment; if not hand the matter to the district attorney for collection. I would also advise the county judges that in construing the law they give the relatives of the party adjudged insane the benefit of every doubt, and require the State to show by preponderance of evidence that they are able to pay the ten dollars per month. The object of the law was to prevent wealthy people who had relatives in the asylum from escaping reasonable contributions to- wards their support, and not to wring ten dollars per month out of every poor person who might have a relative declared insane. even if it should take the last horse or cow to pay it. The case you suggest of the old soldier who has lost a limb and gets forty dollars per month pension, and has nothing else upon which to live, and has several small children to support, should never have been adjudged able to pay, and the county julge should relieve him. The law should be construed to mean, as I believe was the in- tention of the legislature, that it must appear that a person is amply able to pay, and that the payment will not work a hardship or tend to deprive others of the necessities of life.

There is no proof that the notice calling the meeting was posted in three, or any number of conspicuous places, or that it was posted at all, and said subdivision requires that it shall be posted in three public and conspicuous places not less than twenty days prior to the meeting. This notice is really the summons, and brings the parties in, and the statute must be followed or the board will acquire no jurisdiction to act. While there are other defects, it is not worth while to mention them, as the foregoing show the board can not, under proceedings had, issue bonds, at least from what the records show, and a mu- nicipal corporation must speak from its records. The district not having taken the proper steps to authorize the board to issue bonds, and the board being without such authority, cannot law- fully issue the same, and if issued, the State cannot safely invest in them. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. To the Ilonorable Judiciary Committee: GENTLEMEN: Referring to House Bill No. 21, a copy of which was handed to me with your queries, to wit: 1st. Would the enactment of the same as a law interfere with vested rights? 2nd. Is the manner of abatement proper ? Permit me to say as to the first question that, in my opinion, the enactment of the proposed law will not interfere with lawful vested rights. A person in whom the fee of land is vested has the right to make such use of the land as he my choose, so long as he does not erect or maintain a public or private nuisance thereon; but whenever he does maintain a nuisance thereon, he is liable therefcr, and the same may be abated. He has no right to so use his property that it becomes a menace to the pubiic health or safety, and the storage of large quantities of high explosives in close proximity to a public school, postoffice or other public place, or in a densely populated neighborhood is a public nuisance, and &quot; &quot;134 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 2 OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, October, 19, 1903. Hon. P. L. CAMPBELL, President State University, Eugene, Oregon: DEAR SIR: Relative to the questions as to the adoption of text books propounded in yours of the 12th instant, permit me to say, in answer to the first question, that it is my opinion that the text book commission is empowered, under the provisions of section 116, page 77, school laws of 1903, to adopt books in addition to those already provided for by the commission of the legislature, and may do so during the interim between its regular meetings, but the book must not cover the same subject already covered by books already contracted for. It must be an additional subject, unless the con- . tract already made permits additional books on the same subject. Second. In answer to question No. 2, I am of the opinion that a special meeting of the commission would be necessary. A board can speak only through its record, and has no authority to make a record, except at a regular or special meeting. Third. The commission is not empowered to make an adoption by correspondence, without the formality of a meeting. When a person or firm has a contract to furnish books of a cer- tain character, for instance, algebras, for a certain number of years, I am of the opinion it would be a breach of contract for the commission to add another kind of algebras, although I have made no especial examination of that question, not having a contract here to examine.

This is a suit in equity, brought in the circuit court for Lake County, by the State, for the purpose of setting aside certain deeds &quot; &quot;10S REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. purposes, and the duties of the commission, I am of the opinion that whatever duties the commission door perform either as a commission, or as individual commissioners, they must serve with- out pay, except necessary traveling expenses, which also includes hotel expenses. Veither does the act in that respect conflict with the coristitution of the State, for the reason that it does not require the services of any one, such services are voluntary, and if any one does not care to serve, he can resign, but as long as he does serve, in my opinion, he must serve without pay, and the commission can not employ its own members to perform other service than to act as a commissioner. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 18, 1903. Hon. J. 11. ACKERMAN, Superintendent of Public Instruction: DEAR Sir: Referring to your question as to what should be done with the money, if any is on hand, and also with the territory embraced within its boundaries, when a school district ceases to be a legally organized district under the school laws of 1903, permit me to say that under the school laws of 1903, the county school superintendent, and the county judge, and the commissioners of the county in which the district is situated, can, upon its dissolu- tien, upon petition of three legal voters of the district, annex it to two or more districts. Upon dissolution, the money raised by spe- cial tax should be returned to the tax-payers who raised it, and if any money is on hand from the county or State taxes, it should be returned to the county school superintendent, that he may dis- tribute the same among the other districts, or if the territory of the district dissolved shall be promptly annexed to some other dis- triet, then its proportion of the public money should belong to the district as consolidated. But if the territory of the district which has ceased to be a legal district, is not annexed to another, but is treated as a part of the public domain, without any organi- zation, the public funds must be returned, and be distributed by the next appropriation by the county school superintendent. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &quot; &quot;24 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. alleged to have been secured through fraud by the defendant, and its grantors, to certain lands which have been occupied by actual settlers for many years, the defendant claiming said lands as swamp lands. The State asks that the deeds or letters patent to said lands in the actual possession of said settlers be canceled. The lands involved in this case have been the subject of contest be- tween the settlers thereon and the defendant, for many years in the United States Land Office, which was finally decided in favor of the defendant by the honorable Secretary of the Interior, who held it to be swamp land, and patent was issued to defendant com- pany by the General Government, as grantee of the State of Ore- gon. The settlers claim that said decision of the Honorable Secre- tary was procured through false testimony, and further, that the power of the State of Oregon to sell swamp land was restricted to not to exceed 320 acres to any one person or company, and that the State Land Board exceeded its authority in selling to defendants large areas, much in excess of said amount. These lands are part of the lands included in the swamp land application of H. C. Owens, filed with the State Land Board September 6, 1881, em- bracing in the aggregate 78,000 acres. This suit was commenced at the request of the settlers, supple- mented by the request of the Governor, who to some extent in- vestigated the matter, and was of the opinion that the settlers should at least be given an opportunity to prove their claims be- fore a court of competent jurisdiction, this office concurring in his opinion, the settlers to pay the expense of the litigation, and for which they gave a sufficient bond, and employed Hon. John H. Hall, United States District Attorney for Oregon, as special coun- sel. The matter is now pending in the circuit court for Lake County. &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 9 Klamath County. The State, prior to my assuming the duties of this office had applied to the United States Land Department to have said lands patented to the State as inuring to the State under the swamp land grant, and had also employed General W. H. Odell as special counsel. The Honorable Commissioner of the General Land Office denied the application on the ground that the Indians held a prior right to the land. The State employed a Mr. Matthews, in Washington, D. C., to represent the State in the matter on hearing before the Honorable Secretary of the Interior, and this office also made a brief, and forwarded same to Mr. Matthews, who made a supplemental brief, and then filed the same, and also made an oral argument at the hearing before the Honorable Secretary of the Interior. The matter was taken under advisement, and the decision has not yet been rendered. The land involved is represented to be worth from five to fifteen dollars per acre, and if it is worth an average of ten dollars, would be worth nearly one million dollars to the State. Should the application be finally denied, some action should be taken to test the matter in the courts, or our delegation in Congress should try to have the State reimbursed for the loss of the land. The cases hereinafter mentioned are all which have been brought to the attention of this office during the period covered by this report. However they do not show all the criminal cases, and there is no way in which a summary of the crimes which have been committed in the State for any given time can be secured. Prior to the district attorneys being placed on salaries, each was re- quired to report to the Secretary of State the number of persons in- dicted for public offenses, the number tried therefor, and the punishment awarded, with such suggestions as he might deem pertinent. This was required by section 1001 of Bellinger and Cotton&apos;s Annotated Codes and Statutes, which law is still in force, but is practically obsolete. The reports are not now made. If the Attorney-General was authorized to demand such reports, he could embody a summary in his biennial report, and the same would show the amount and kind of crime existing, and the legis- lature could therefore act with knowledge as to criminal legisla- tion. &quot; &quot;Lisy 1935 LAW LIBRARY BIENNIAL REPORT. ATTORNEY GENERAL&apos;S OFFICE, January 9, 1899. To the Hon. Wm P. Lord, Governor : I have the honor herewith to submit the second biennial re- port of this office, giving a general synopsis of the business transacted in this department since the convening of the legis- lative assembly in January, 1897. Although the statutes of this state do not require a report, I have deemed it expedient to inform you of the business coming under the immediate supervision of this department, the man- ner of its disposition, and to recommend such changes in the laws relative to the office, its powers and duties, expedient to a more complete exercise of its usefulness. During the two years included in this report, I have appeared in the supreme court, on behalf of the state, in the circuit courts of the state, in which the state was made a party, in the United States circuit and United States court of appeals, and in the land offices in more than sixty cases, some of which in- volved large interests and called for much time in preparation and trial. I have prepared a list of these cases, which is hereby sub- mitted, with a schedule showing their status at the present time:- United States court of appeals, 1. United States court, 1. State supreme court, 48. State circuit courts, 12. United States land office, 1. The cases in the United States circuit court and court of ap- peals have been disposed of. Of the cases in the supreme court of the state 39 have received final decisions, 4 have been argued and submitted, and 10 are now pending for hearing. Of the 12 cases in the circuit courts, eight have been tried, two are at issue, two complaints have been filed by the state, to which dilatory pleas have been filed, which will be disposed of upon the convening of court at the next term. The cases in the supreme court are classified as follows:- &quot; &quot;1 In ! 1 &quot; &quot; CORNELL UNIVERSITY LAW LIBRARY THE GIFT OF Oregon State . state Library Salem, Oregon. Date. Sept.24.19.35 &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 115 OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, July 7, 1903. Hon. State Land Board: GENTLEMEN: In accordance with your instructions, I have, as far as possible for me to do with the time at my command, investi- gated the charges of fraud in certain land sales alleged to have been perpetrated by one S. A. D. Puter, and I find that certificates numbers 7553, 8417, 8418, 8419, 8420, 8421, 8122, 8425, 8426, 8127. 8761, 8762, 8765, 8766, 8768, 8839, 8840, 8811, and 8838 were apparently issued to fictitious persons. The evidence of the same consists in the fact that no person named in any of the certificates can be found to have ever existed and the applications and assign- ments on the same appear to be in the same handwriting. This does not depend alone on the testimony of handwriting experts, but on examination of many of the papers the signature of the assignee, the notary&apos;s signature, and signature of applicant, and writing in the body of each strikes a person as having been writ- ten by one and the same person, and at the same time, and with the same pen and ink; also inquiries at the place where Mr. Puter testified the applicants resided, fails to discover that such persons were ever known in that vicinity. This is all supported by the testimony of Mr. Wesco, who claims to be an expert on hand- writing, and pronounces the signatures as forgeries. Also two witnesses say they will testify that after the contest had over these lands before your honorable board, S. A. D. Puter stated that he had fooled the board, and that there were only two or three genu- ine signatures. The title in the land in question is now in a corpo. ration which claims bona fides. The testimony which I have been able to discover so far, as to their knowledge of the fraudulent purchase of the land, is that one Charles Chaffee, who is a stockholder in, and secretary of the said corporation, was told that the entries were fraudulent prior to the purchase of the land by the corporation, and the circum- stances were related to him in detail. That one John Barnes, who is attorney for the said corporation, was likewise so informed prior to said corporation investing in said lands. He is also a stockholder in the company. I have also examined the petition filed with your honorable body by Messrs. Platt and Platt for the said corporation, the same being 2 &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 99 I am of the opinion that when the written request of the treas- urer of the board of regents of said college, countersigned by the secretary, requesting a sum not exceeding one-fourth of the annual tax, for purposes for which it was authorized, it is your duty to draw the warrant, although accompanied by no itemized voucher. The principles upon which this opinion is based are set forth in my opinion of May 11, 1903, to Hon. John D. Daley, secretary of board of regents of the Agricultural College, a copy of which opinion I herewith transmit. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-(ENERAL, S. LEM, Oregon, June 4, 1903. Hox. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Replying to yours of the 29th ultimo, by Mr. Wrightman, as to whether a corporation increasing its capital stock prior to July 1st, when the license fee becomes payable, must pay an annual license fee upon such increase for the balance of the fiscal year, ending June 30, 1903, I would say I am of the opinion that such license fee should be paid. Section 5 of the act of 1903, page 43, session laws of said year, provides for the payment of an annual license fee to be paid in advance, on or before July 1st, of each year, based on the amount of the capital stock, and it further provides that new corporations formed, or entering the State during the fiscal year, the first year&apos;s fee shall be proportionate to such fraction of a year. An increase of capital stock should be treated the same as a new corporation, as far as the license fee is concerned. Section 3 of the act provides that &amp;quot;Every corporation which shall file with the Secretary of State a certificate of its increase of its capital stock, as hereinbe- fore provided for, shall thereupon pay to the Secretary of State the same fee upon the amount of such increase of stock as is re- quired by this act upon the formation of a corporation.&amp;quot; Section 1 provides: “Every corporation hereafter organized * shall pay to the Secretary of State upon presentation of its arti- cles of incorporation, an organization fee, and an annual license &quot; &quot;1 i &quot; &quot;[ 12 ] crime charged, the number of convictions, the penalty inflicted, the amount of acquittals, the fines collected and the costs and expenses attendant upon the enforcement and execution of the law in each county of the state. A summary of this report should be included in a semian- nual report from this office, which would undoubtedly furnish valuable information to the executive department in its recom. mendations to the legislative assembly, as well as properly and correctly inform the chief executive officer of the state of the extent, punishment and character of infractions of the law and the cost of its enforcement. In conclusion, I would say that nearly all the states require either annual or semiannual reports from this department and a publication of the opinions rendered for the benefit of those whom they are calculated to serve. There is no such provision in our law, although nearly 2,000 folios of opinions that have been rendered since the creation of this office, setting forth many questions that are constantly presenting themselves to those assuming office, are properly recorded and now in the custody of this department. If published and properly indexed under the different subjects treated, they would serve the purpose for which they were written and would relieve much labor and save much valuable time, both to this and the other depart- ments of the state. Most respectfully submitted, C. M. IDLEMAN, Attorney-general. &quot; &quot;14 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. assault with a dangerous weapon upon the person of David Hali- day.

DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Yours of the 18th instant, asking my opinion as to whether a mutual fire insurance association, organized under the laws of this State can lawfully issue a non-assessable policy or cer- tificate stamped across the face thereof &amp;quot;non-assessable,&amp;quot; and ** whether such policy would be valid, and whether the Insurance Commissioner can question the method of doing business,&amp;quot; and inclosing correspondence with the Oregon Fire Relief Association concerning the matter, has my attention. The question whether a mutual company can issue paid-up policies depends upon their charters, and by-laws, and the laws of the State governing such associations. The object of the association above named according to its articles of incorporation or constitution is the mutual pro- tection and relief to any of its members who may suffer loss by fire, and it is organized under the insurance laws of this State governing mutual companies or associations, and section 3739 of Bellinger and Cotton&apos;s Annotated Codes and Statutes provides “that no policy or certificate of insurance shall be issued to any other than a member of the association or corporation.&amp;quot; Therefore a mutual corporation or association must deal with its own mem- bers, and they are necessarily both the insured and the insurer. I find nothing in the laws of this State prohibiting such an organiza- tion from issuing a paid-up policy if the mutuality governing the transaction of its business, and which under the law exists between its members, is maintained. Further, section 5 of division 2 of the by-laws of said association provides, “Short term paid-up certificates, also paid-up certificates for one and three years may be issued by charging therefor in ad. dition to the payments provided in section 2, division 1, an advance loss assessment, the amount to be ascertained and proportioned in accordance with the cost of the same class of risks written upon the assessment plan.” The payments provided in section 2, di- vision 1, are a membership fee of $1.50, certificate fee of $1.50 and an expense assessment; and section 6 of division 2 provides that al! such fees, expenses, and advance loss assessment on paid-up certifi- cates shall be due on the date such certificate takes effect.

It contains nothing whatever of a temporary nature, and I am of the opinion that it is prospective as well as retroactive in effect, and that all of its provisions are prospective, although some of them may apply to transactions both of date prior to its taking effect and to those bearing a later date. You say the certificates of sale under consideration are subject to cancellation under strict construction of the law, to wit: sec- tions 3306 and 3307 above mentioned, and not under the rules of the board. Said sections provide that &quot;if any installment of prin- cipal or interest shall remain unpaid for one year after the same becomes due, the sale and certificate shall be void and all payments thereon shall be forfeited, and the land shall be deemed vacant and shall be subject to sale as if it had not before been soid.” In the case of State v. Emmet, 19 Kan. 546, the court held that under an act of that State, reading “any purchaser failing to pay the annual interest when the same becomes due, or the balance of the purchase money when it becomes due, shall forfeit all right to the land from the time of said failure of payment, and the county attorney shall proceed to eject him from said premises, if in pos- session,” the failure to pay principal or interest when due, ipso facto, worked a forfeiture, and the interest of the purchaser in the land instantly and absolutely ceased. However, in the later Kansas decisions, the principle is also announced that while technically and strictly such failure works a forfeiture, if thereafter such pur- chasers completed their payments and received patents, their title was safe. That while officers can not relinquish any legal claim of the State, their acts in waiving mere technical and arbitrary for- feitures, and which are never challenged by the State itself, will be upheld as against the complaints of any third party. It is a mat- ter wholly between the State and the purchaser, and the just anil equitable claims of the State were paid. This impresses me as the best rule and founded upon principles of strict equity between all parties. But the provisions of said sections 3306 and 3307 do not apply to the cases under consideration. They apply to cases where the State has title, and the purchaser fails to make payments. In such cases the board can take advantage of forfeiture, but no third per- &apos; &quot;190 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. “could not and can not convey title,” indicate that it was the in- tention that it should apply to past as well as future sales. The general presumption is that statutes are prospective only. End lich on Construction of Statutes, section 272, says: “Even where there is that in the statute which would seem upon other princi- ples of interpretation, to require a retroactive construction, the presumption against the same, in the absence of an intention other- wise demonstrable to give the statute such an effect, will overcome the influence of such rules. Thus, where an act amended and re- enacted a former act, which provided that every conveyance not recorded should be void as against attachment and judgment cred- itors, but omitted the words ‘hereafter made,&apos; contained in the earlier act, it was, nevertheless, held that the act should not apply to conveyances executed prior to the statute re-enacted by it. And so, as it has been seen that the strict grammatical sense of the lan- guage used by the legislature may give way to a construction re- quired by other rules of interpretation, words apparently import- ing a retroactive effect will yet, in the absence of other reasons supporting such literal construction, be so construed as to produce a prospective operation Thus, an act which makes certain provisions &apos;when any judgment is obtained&apos; is construed as refer- ring to such cases only when any judgment is hereafter ob- tained ;&apos; and so the provisions of an act regulating, with addi- tional requirements, appeals ‘in all cases in which judgment shall have been rendered.&apos;&apos; If we attempt to hold that the act is retroactive only, we must find something therein which plainly indicates that intention of the legislature, and I find nothing in the sections under consideration to warrant such construction. Section 3311 reads: &amp;quot;Any per- son who has paid to the State Land Board any money on lands ou which the State could not and can not convey title, etc.” shall be entitled to repayment. It does not say heretofore paid, but “Any person who has paid ;&apos;&apos; when? At any time, when any person has paid, and he cannot receive title he shall be repaid. This seems to me to be the plain meaning of the statute when viewed in the light of the general rules for construction of statutes, and keeping the object for which it was enacted in mind. This view is further strengthened by the fact that it is not a temporary, but a permanent statute. Sections 3310 and 3311 are a &quot; &apos;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 201 those portions of the old law copied into the enactment without change, are not re-enacted. In the light of these decisions, the words &quot;First Judicial District, $3,000,&quot; republished without change in the amending act, were not re-enacted, but were inad- vertently inserted. Further, the same legislature held the regular and special ses- sions of 1903, and we must presume they knew what they had done at the regular session, creating two prosecuting attorney districts, and fixing the salaries, and that therefore they did not at the spe- cial session intend to repeal any part of said act by implication, nor by implied legislation, to increase the salaries of $2,000 and $1,500 respectively for the first and second districts to $3,000 each. In view of the foregoing authorities and the further principle which is well established, that repeals by implication are not favored, I am of the opinion that the district attorneys of the First Judicial District are not entitled to receive $3,000 each, but that the attorney for the first district is entitled to receive payment at the rate of $2,000, and for the second, $1,500 per annum. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, July 14, 1904. DR. Woops HUTCHINSON, State Health Officer, Portland, Oregon: DEAR SIR: Replying to your communication of the 27th ultimo, relative to whether the State Board of Health has power to re- quire all plans for public buildings to be submitted to it for its approval before construction shall be proceeded with, permit me to say that in my opinion the board does not have that power. The title of the act, Senate Bill No. 27, laws of 1903, regular session, page 82, reads: “An Act to Establish a State Board of Health; to Establish County Boards of Health in Each and Every County in the State of Oregon; to Provide for the Election of a Secretary of Vital Statistics; to Provide for Uniform Blanks and Reports, and to Assign Certain Duties to the State, City, and County Boards of Health, and to Provide a Penalty.” No legis- &apos; &quot;92 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. If the courts have no authority to review the action of the board, except legal fraud is shown, I fail to see how the Secretary of State can do so. It is clear from the acts of the legislature relating to the Agri- cultural College that the whole government and management there- of is vested in the board as a quasi municipal corporation, the same as school districts, and other like corporations, and the board is the only body authorized to make contracts on its behalf, and the power to make necessarily includes the power to discharge them, and the power to discharge its obligations arising under such con- tracts, therefore to audit the claims against it. No other body is authorized under the act to expend and pay out the appropriation. It appearing that the board of directors is the auditing board, when and how does it draw this appropriation to meet its bills ? Section 3 of the 1901 act provides that the fund shall be drawn quar- terly by the treasurer of the board of regents, and section 2 by warrants drawn by the Secretary of State on the State Treasurer, and the law of 1885, section 7, provides that the fund shall be drawn on warrants issued by the Secretary of State on the written request of the board of regents, countersigned by the secretary. I find no other provisions touching this question, and therefore it follows that whenever the written request of the treasurer of the bcard of regents, countersigned by the secretary, is presented re- questing a quarterly payment to meet current expenses, salaries of officers, etc., the Secretary has no discretion in the matter, but must draw the warrant for the same. He can not inquire how many teachers were employed, their salaries, nor anything of that nature. The requisition is within the law when it states that a certain sum is required for the purposes for which the appropria- tion was made, for a certain quarter, and requests the warrant to be drawn therefor. Nothing in any of the acts relative to the college requires the president or other officer thereof, or the board to make any reports to the Secretary of State, but the president is required by section 5 of the act of 1885 to make annual written re- ports to the Governor of the State, setting forth the condition of the colleve, financial and otherwise, with such recommendations touching the same as he may think proper. Further, I find nothing in the act requiring the board to wait till they audit the accounts for the quarter before they direct the requisition to be made, and &quot; &quot;186 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. a teacher who holds a certificate is permitted to send a teacher who does not hold a certificate, to do the teaching, then the certificate is made to legalize another teacher&apos;s services, and, in my opinion, the power to do so is not vested in the voters of the district, but in the legislature. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 4, 1904. Hon. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: I have examined the matter referred to in the com- munication of N. J. Judah, city recorder of the City of Salem, rela- tive to the conveyance to the city of that part of Court Street sewe owned by the State, and have arrived at the conclusion that no officers of the State have the authority to make the transfer. You as Secretary of State have the care and custody of State property. but I find no law authorizing you to transfer the same. Special authority is conferred on the State Land Board to sell lands, etc., but that would not, in my opinion, extend to sewers. The only way I see to make the transfer is to have the legislature authorize it. The State officers can recommend it, and no doubt the authority will be granted. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General Inclosure herewith returned. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 7, 1904. Hon. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR Sir: In compliance with your request of this date, I have examined the articles of incorporation of the Grande Ronde Valley Artesian Well Company, and the laws relating to the organization of corporations, and am of the opinion that the said corporation &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 125 concur. now ion of September 12, 1889, a copy of which opinion you have, and in which I Klamath County, it appears by said letter of Judge Baldwin above referred to, has organized a county fair association, and desires to draw its proportion of pre- mium money for this year. It also appears that Klamath County held an agricultural fair in 1902, and therefore by the terms of said section 4175 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. is entitled to the sum of $300 to pay premiums awarded; provided Lake County holds no fair, and we have no information that it intends to do so; but in case Lake County holds a fair the $300 would have to be divided be- tween Klamath and Lake Counties. To enable Klamath County to draw the money, it will be neces- sary for the county judge of said county to make an affidavit that said society has held a fair, and awarded premiums to the amount expected to be received, particularly setting forth the same and designating the treasurer of the society, and that a fair was held! during the preceding year; and also there should be some evidence. which might be embodied in the affidavit, that no fair is to be held in Lake County. This affidavit should be filed with the president of the First Southern Oregon Agricultural Society, who should draw the money from the Secretary of State, and pay it over to the Treasurer of the Klamath County Agricultural Society. &apos; Mr. T. E. Hill, of Ashland, was the president of said First Southern Oregon Agricultural Society up to May 1903, at which time he says his commission expired. However, if no successor has been appointed, he is still the president of said society, for under section 3 of the act of 1893, being section 4168 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. it is pro- vided that the president shall hold for the period of one year, or until his successor is elected and qualified; and I am of the opinion that it was the intention of the legislature that he should perform the duties of president until his successor was elected and qualified. The fact that the First Southern Oregon Agricultural Society holds no fair this year should not be allowed to deprive Klamath County of its appropriation; neither will the failure of the county judge to file his affidavit on or before August 31st, defeat the appro- priation, if he files the same before the warrant is requested, as that is only the proof which must be furnished, and the time can be waived by the officers. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Atorney-General. &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 209 In Puget Sound Agricultural Co. 1. Pierce County, 1 Wash. Ter. 159, the court says: “Though it be conceded the legal title to the lands yet remains in the United States, appellant has such an equitable interest therein as is subject to taxation,&amp;quot; and cites Carroll ». Perry et al. 4 McLean U. S. Circuit Court Rep. page 25. in which case the court says: “It is assumed that at the time the land was assessed for taxation, the fee was in the United States, and consequently it was not liable to taxation. This position can not be maintained. It imposes a limitation on State powers which does not come within the delegated powers of the General Govern- ment. The taxing power of a State may reach everything within a State which can be denominated property. It may be made to embrace all equitable credits of whatever description they may be.&amp;quot; The same doctrine is upheld in the following cases : Witherspoon v. Duncan, 4 Wallace (U. S.) 219; The Iowa Homestead Co. 2. Webster Co. 21 Iowa, 221. 231; Kansas Pac. Ry. Co. v. Culp, 9 Kan. 38, 47; Carroll v. Stafford, 4 U. S. 440, 460. Railway Co. v. McShane et al. 22 Wall (U. S.) 414; Astrom et al. v. Hammond Aditon, etc. 3 McLean, 109; (U. S. Circuit..) In which last case the court says: “Until the patent is issued the purchaser has not the legal title, but having made his entry of the land and paid for it, the government can no more dispose of the land to another person than if the patent had been issued. The final certificate obtained on the payment of the money is as binding on the government as the patent.” Jany more cases might be cited, but we deem it unnecessary. The rule appears to be weli settled that lands are taxable as soon as the applicant has done everything required to entitle him to a patent. In the light of these decisions it seems that lieu selections become taxable when the proofs are all complete in the local land office and the fees paid. The applicant is then entitled to a patent, and if he has not been guilty of fraud the government can not refuse to issue the same. Therefore the first day of March after such proofs and payments are made would be the date that such lanit becomes liable to assessment for purposes of taxation. Timber Att&apos;y Gen. -14 &quot; &quot;126 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, September 14, 1903. Hon. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: Replying to yours of the 9th instant as to whether the bill of the State Printer for making, and bill of Blake-McFall &amp;amp; Company for cardboard for warning cards, ordered by the State Board of Health, under laws of 1903, page 84, should be paid out of the appropriation for the expenses of the State Board of Health, or the appropriation for public printing, permit me to say that I am of the opinion that the bills should be paid from the former appropriation. Section 11 of the act creating the board of health, laws of 1903, page 85, provides that the Secretary of State shall furnish suitable books and blanks for keeping records of vital statistics, and for reporting the same to the county boards of health, and to the Sec- retary of the State Board of Health. Section 7 of the act appro- priates the sum of $5,000 to pay the salary of the secretary of the board, clerical service, and contingent expenses of his office, and the expenses of the board. These bills under consideration are cer- tainly not within the purview of section 11, not being for books, blanks, etc., for keeping vital statistics, or reporting the same, and they are in no sense for public printing as contemplated in the appropriation for that purpose. Therefore the bills should be paid from the appropriation for the expenses of the State Board of Health. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL.

ACKERMAN, Superintendent of Public Instruction: DEAR Sir: In the matter which you referred to me this day relative to the election to be held in School District No. 40 in Mor- row County, Oregon, for the purpose of voting bonds, and the election to be held at the same time and place, namely at Hard- man, in said county and State, on the 15th instant, for the pur- pose of voting on the incorporation of said town of Hardman, per- mit me to say that in my opinion the incorporation of the town of Hardman can in no way interfere with any of the rights or privi- leges of any inhabitant or pupil of said district, either by changing the boundaries of said district or by subjecting the pupils living outside of the limits of said town to the payment of tuition. Any bonds voted at said district election will subject to taxation all property included in said district irrespective of said town cor- porate limits. No payment of tuition can be imposed upon any pupil residing in the district, whether within or without said cor- porate limits. &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 11 CIRCUIT COURT, MARION COUNTY.

This is a suit in equity, commenced October 2, 1902, for the purpose of compelling the State Land Board to issue a deed to plaintiff for certain lands described in the petition. A demurrer was filed, and being sustained, plaintiff appealed, and the case is now pending in the Supreme Court, plaintiff having until Novem- ber 1, 1904, to file his brief. SUPREME COURT. Cases pending in the Supreme Court at the time I entered upon the duties of this office, and those which have since been appealed to the Supreme Court, in which the State is interested: &quot; &quot;&quot; &apos;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 75 Relative to the first question, permit me to say that as I look at the matter, the law appropriating money to pay the volunteers in said wars, recognized that services had been rendered the Terri- tory of Oregon which deserved compensation, and appropriated money therefor. If that is true, it was not a gift, but a payment of an existing indebtedness to certain persons for services per- formed, and was due the moment the law went into effect. The volunteer who could furnish the evidence required had a vested in- terest in the fund, to the extent his proofs show him entitled. It be- ing a property right, to wit: a sum of money due and owing, would descend according to the laws of inheritance of this State, and the widow would have no preference right, nothing in the act appear- ing to indicate that such was the intention of the legislature. She would have the same interest that she would have in any other per- sonal property of the estate. Therefore I am of the opinion that in case a volunteer dies sub- sequent to the taking effect of the act. his heirs, or rather his estate is entitled to the money appropriated for him, and that the widow has no preference right, and in such case the administrator or the heirs would have the right to furnish the proofs. The second question seems to be answered by the terms of the act itself. Section 1 provides that the appropriation is made to pay the veterans “who served under and by virtue of the officers of Oregon Territory, etc.,&quot; and section 4 provides, “This act so far as it relates to the pay of volunteers shall be construed so as to apply to all who have been in the service of the Territory of Ore- gon, etc.” A person, whether an officer, commissioned or non- commissioned, must have been in the service of the Territory of Oregon, and a private must have served also under Oregon Terri- torial officers. Persons who enlisted in regiments of the Territory of Washington, but who served a short time within the boundary limits of the Territory of Oregon, certainly are not within the purview of the act; although for a short time in Oregon Terri- tory, they were all the time in the service of Washington Territory. Therefore I am of the opinion that your last question must be answered in the negative. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &apos; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 77 The power to employ teachers is therefore wisely made general, and a contract for one year or more, if made in good faith, and without fraudulent collusion, must be held binding. The case of Reubelt v. The School Town of Noblesville, 106 Ind. 478, holds that a contract made prior to an annual election in June of a new member of the board is valid. The same doctrine announced in the foregoing cases is sustained in the following: Tappan v. School District, 44 Mich, 500; Webster v. School District No. 4, 16 Wis. 336; Gillis v. Space, 63 Barb. 177; Silver v. Cummings, 7 Wend. 183; Cleveland v. Amy, 8 Mich. 174; School Town of Milford v. Ziegler, 1 Ind. App. 138. In the light of the foregoing authorities, I am satisfied that the contract is valid and binding on the district. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL, SALEM, Oregon, April 21, 1903. HON. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: I have examined the questions propounded in the letter of Mr. S. B. Linthicum, of date 13th instant, by you re- ferred to me, and am of the opinion that all foreign corporations, joint stock companies, or associations formed for the purpose of gain, whether they have heretofore lawfully engaged in the trans- action of business in this State or not, must, after the act approved by the Governor, and filed in your office February 16, 1903, takes effect, make and file the declaration mentioned in section 7 of the act, and at the same time pay the sum of fifty dollars for filing the same, and the license fee for the fraction of the fiscal year, after filing the declaration. Section 8 makes a distinction be- tween those not, and those heretofore lawfully transacting busi- ness in the State by giving the latter six months from and after &quot; &quot;66 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. the court held that ratification could only be by a person ascertained at the time of the act done, a person in existence actually or in contemplation of law, as in the case of assignees of bankrupts or administrators whose title for the protection of the estate vests by relation. To the same effect are: Anson on Contracts, page 444 to 446. Sage v. Fargo Tp. 107 Fed. 383&apos; (Kan.) If an agent enters into a contract on behalf of a principal who is incapable of making it or into an illegal contract, no ratification is pessible. The transaction is void in one case from the incapaci- ty of the principal, and in the other from the illegality of the act. However, the commission is in existence, and anything within the purview of the act would not be ultra vires, which is the principle the first part of the above-cited proposition is based upon. No act strictly ultra vires can be ratified by any corporation or other or- ganization for the reason that it could not perform the act in the first place, being beyond its powers. But a contract made on behalf of a corporation, and voidable at the instance of the corporation, may be ratified by the board of directors. Salem Iron Co. v. Lake Superior, etc. 112 Fed. 239.

SALEM, Oregon, February 25, 1903 Hon. J. D. LEE, Superintendent of Oregon State Penitentiary: DEAR SIR: . In reply to the question which you asked me a few days ago relative to Senate Bill 89, which refers to the employ- ment of convict labor, I am of the opinion that the same went into effect on the 18th inst., the Governor having signed it, and I think that the emergency clause is sufficient to give effect immediately upon the Governor affiixing his signature. Very respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Salem, Oregon, February 24, 1903. To the Honorable Board of Public Building Commissioners: GENTLEMEN : I have examined the conveyance tendered by the Salem Flouring Mills Company, The Themas Kay Woolen Mills Company, and the Salem Water Company, purporting to convey to the State of Oregon for the sum of twenty thousand dollars, the right to divert 1,200,000 gallons of water daily from the water flowing through Mill Creek. No abstract of title having been fur- nished, I have availed myself of all information in my reach, and find that in 1856 the State of Oregon granted to the Willamette Woolen Manufacturing Company certain rights and privileges set forth in the following language, to wit: “Section 5. Said corporation shall have power to bring water from the Santiam River to any place or places in or near Salem, to be brought as far as practicable through the channel or valley of Mill Creek; and for such purpose may enter upon lands and also said creek, and do all things proper and suitable for a safe, direct, and economical conveyance of water as aforesaid; but said cor- peration shall do no unnecessary injury to private property, and shall be answerable in damages to any person whose property is injured by its acts. “Section 6. Said corporation shall have the exclusive right to the hydraulic powers and privileges created by the water which it &quot; &quot;30 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. which the fishway is built.

THOMAS W. NORDBY, Plaintiff, V. JOHN PARKER, et al., Defendants. This was a suit to foreclose a mortgage brought by the plaintiff against the defendant Parker, and the State Land Board was made a party defendant for the reason that the State had held a mort- gage on the lands under consideration in this case, and it was sought to foreclose any interest which the State might still have. On investigation it was found that the State had no interest at the time of the commencement of this suit, as the mortgage of the State had been fully paid. IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE STATE OF OREGON, FOR Wasco COUNTY. No. 36. STATE OF OREGON, Plaintiff, &amp;gt; U. I. H. TAFFE, Defendant. This is a condemnation proceeding on the part of the State to secure a right of way throught the property of the defendant for the United States canal around the obstructions in the Columbia River between The Dalles and Celilo, under and by virtue of the act of the legislature passed at the special session of 1903, and &quot; &quot;84 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 2 election of road supervisors by the people, when we undertake to apply the well-settled rules of construction to the two statutes, the latter must prevail, and the former is repealed by implica- tion. Judge Bean says, in State v. Rogers, 22 Or. 359, &amp;quot;A sub- sequent affirmative statute does not repeal a prior one unless there is a conflict between the two which is direct and irreconcilable. But where such conflict does exist and the conflict can not be reconciled under the rules of statutory construction, the subsequent statute, being the later expression of the legislature on the subject, must be considered in force, and to operate as a repeal by implica- tion of all former acts in conflict therewith.&amp;quot; This is the rule that our courts have held in a long line of decisions, both before and since the one above quoted, and I am of the opinion House Bill No. 80 was impliedly repealed by House Bill No. 280. Relative to your third question as to whether IIouse Bill No. 251, laws of 1903, page 260, is repealed by said House Bill No. 280 above menticned, I find that No. 251 passed the House the 9th, the Senate the 19th, was approved by the Governor and filed in the Secretary of State&apos;s office the 24th of February, 1903, and is therefore prior in point of enactment to No. 280. It provides for the appointment of road master, prescribes his duties, term of office, and compensation, and will take effect May 21, 1903, the same being ninety days after the session closed. Section 35 of No. 280 also provides for the appointment of road master prescribes his duties, term of office, and compensation, the same as No. 251, and is in almost identical language. The princi- pal difference is the former provides for appointment of road mas- ter as soon as the law takes effect, to hold until the first session of the county court in January, 1904, at which time, and annually thereafter, such appointment shall be made, etc. The latter act provides that appointment shall be made at the first session in 1904, and annually thereafter, the same as the former. By provisions of the former act a road master can be appointed as soon as the act takes effect, to serve until the first session of the county court in January, 1904, when his successor will be appointed. By the latter act, no appointment will be made until January, 1904. I do not consider that an irreconcilable conflict under the authorities before cited, exists. A road master can serve until January, 1904, and in no way interfere with the operation of the other act. There &quot; &quot;38 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 2 fourth of a mile. It would be difficult, and might be impossible, for small children to attend in their own district, and the law seems to be intended to give the parent or guardian the right to send them to the nearer school. The rule as laid down by our Honorable Supreme Court in a number of decisions for the construction of statutes where the words &amp;quot;may,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;must&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;shall&amp;quot; appear is as follows: In Kohn “ &amp;amp; Co. v. Ilinshaw, 17 Or. at page 311, the court say: &amp;quot;It is a general principle in statutory construction that where the word may&apos; is used in conferring power upon an officer, court or tri- bunal, and the public cr a third person has an interest in the ex- ercise of the power, then the exercise of the power becomes im- perative.&amp;quot; Also in Smith v. King, 14 Or. at page 14, the same doe- trine is announced, the court holding that “when the public in- terest is concerned, or the rights of third persons are affected, the words ‘may&apos; and &apos;shall&apos; are construed to mean the same thing.&amp;quot; Then the court continues, &amp;quot;this rule is too well settled to re- quire a citation of authorities to sustain it.” Also in the case of McLeod 1. Scott, et al. 21 Or. 94, the court directly approves and follows the rule laid down in the two cases above cited. In King Real Estate Association, et al. v. City of Portland, 23 Or. 199, the word “may” is construed “must” when the legislature means to impose a positive duty, and not merely to give a dis- cretionary power. “But it is only where it is necessary to give effect to the clear intentien of the legislature that it can be con- strued in a mandatory sense; and where there is nothing in the connection of the language or in the sense and policy of the pro- vision to require an musual interpretation, it is merely permis- sive and discretionary.&amp;quot; Applying the foregoing principles to the subdivision referred to in your request, it would appear that the public has an interest in the exercise of the power, at least to the extent of the proportion of the school money apportioned to the child proposed to be trans- ferred and a third person, to wit: such child, by its parent or guardian, has an interest, and an interest of the greatest import- ance-its education-in the exercise of the power conferred upon the directors, and there is no question but that the board of di- rectors constitute a board of officers, a court or tribunal to act upon matters within their jurisdiction. I am therefore of the &quot; &quot;36 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. IN THE UNITED STATES LAND OFFICE, ROSEBURG, OREGON. No. 42. STATE OF OREGON, Contestant, V. HENRY F. BERGMAN, Contestee.

Young, 17 Or. 150, holds that the statutes relative to the care of the ballots is directory, and Lord, Justice, in delivering the opinion of the court, says: “When by acts of omission, or commission, through inadvertence, or mis- take, it sometimes happens that the poll book is deposited in the ballot box, or the returns inclosed in the envelope, as the case may be, such acts or omissions are treated as irregularities, and the provisions of the law in respect thereto as directory only, and will not defeat the ballots as original evidence, provided they are properly accredited, and have been safely kept and preserved in- violate,&quot; citing the case of Hudson v. Solomon, 19 Kan. 180, where the ballot box was unlocked for the purpose of taking out the poll book, and under the facts the court regarded the oppor- tunity for tampering with the ballots and discrediting them as too slight for serious consideration. The reason for securing the order from the county judge, which should be spread upon his record, and then opening the boxes in the presence of the judge and canvassing board, and after relocking, and resealing the boxes, placing them again in the vault, or place where you keep the boxes deposited, is for the purpose of pre- serving abundant evidence that when the boxes were opened to re- move the tally sheets and poll books, the ballots were not tam- pered with, and the boxes containing them as securely sealed as they were before they were opened. I am of the opinion that the canvassing board would have the authority to open the boxes, remove the tally sheets, and poll books, and reseal them without the order of the court, but securing the order of the court is an additional safeguard, and is so much more evidence of the safe-keeping of the ballots, so that they may be easily identified should a court require them in some judicial inquiry. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. &apos; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 31 filed in the office of the Secretary of State, December 24, 1903. The defendant refusing to agree with the Board of Commissioners of Canals and Locks, appointed by said act of the legislature to secure for the State said right of way, action was commenced as by the act provided, on May 5, 1904, and the case was tried in the circuit court July 5, 1904, resulting in a verdict July 8, 1904, by which the right of way was condemned to the State and dam- ages awarded to the defendant in the sum of $15,000, and his costs and disbursements. Ju:Igment was entered September 9, 1904, according to the verdict. &amp;gt; IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE STATE OF OREGON. FOR CLACKAMAS COUNTY. No. 37. STATE LAND BOARD, Plaintiff, V. EMMA FITZGERALD, Defendant. This suit was commenced in the above-entitled court October 4, 1903, to quiet title to certain lands in Clackamas County, formerly owned by one Philip Foster, who gave a mortgage to the plaintiff September 8, 1878. The mortgage was afterwards fore- closed and the land sold and bid in by the plaintiff, and the sale duly confirmed by the court, but no deed issued by the sheriff of said county therefor. Thereafter, December 14, 1901, the plain- tiff, on the representations of the defendant that the records of Clackamas County showed that said mortgage had not been fore- closed, and that the same was outlawed, executed a satisfaction of the same for the sum of $200, paid by the said Emma Fitz- gerald, or her agent. April 21, 1903, the sheriff of Clackamas County issued a deed for the said lands. The suit was brought on the ground that the defendant had secured the satisfaction through misrepresentations, and the cause having been heard by the court and taken under advisement, it is still pending. &quot; &quot;50 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. question under consideration. In 1891, the legislature enacted a law &amp;quot;To License and Regulate Life and Casualty Insurance Com. panies and Societies,” page 167 et seq. session laws of that year. Under its provisions, each agent or solicitor of every such life in- surance company, corporation, or society, must annually take out a license and pay the Insurance Commissioner five dollars therefor. In 1899 an act was passed by the legislature, regulating fire in- surance only, in which act the word “agent” was defined, when used in the act, and therefore could not apply to life insurance, session laws of 1899, page 187. It follows that the contracts under consideration must be construed under the provisions of the stat- ute of 1891, unless the same has been amended, and I fail to find that such is the case, so far as the licensing of agents is concerned, and the only question to be considered is, is an adviser duly ap- pointed by the company, an agent of the company, and that ques- tion must be determined by the terms of the appointment and the law as to what constitutes an agent. An agent is defined in Am. and Eng. Enc. of Law to be a person duly authorized to act on behalf of another, or whose unauthorized act has been duly ratified.” A sub-agent is “a person selected by an agent to perform a part or all of the duties of the employment.” A special agent is “a person employed to do a single act, or for a special purpose.”&apos; and the law dictionaries and text books on agency give similar definitions, and I think we can safely rely on the above being the rule. Applying the same to the Jacobs contract (Indiana Co.) the lo- cal adviser&apos;s duty is to recommend suitable persons whom he may secure for insurance, and by his efforts to maintain on the books of the company at least $5,000 of insurance, and to advise as to fitness and desirability of agents and applicants for agencies, and to furnish confidential information regarding the personal habits of applicants for insurance and of lapsed policy holders who apply for reinstatement and to assist in protecting the company from the payment of false and fradulent claims, but he is not to solicit in- surance, nor forward applications. The Spicer contract (New York Co.) is in substance the same, although the amount of the insurance the adviser is to aid in maintaining is not stated. It is to be all written through the agency of the first party to the contract. The adviser in this contract is to furnish information : &quot; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 105 as to whether his corporation is liable to pay the annual license fee under the provisions of House Bill No. 2, laws of 1903, page 39, I am of the opinion that said corporation must pay the annual li. cense fee, and that all building and loan associations, or loan asso- ciations are required to pay the same. The act provides that every corporation, foreign or domestic, organized and formed for the purpose of profit, except fire, marine, fire and marine, life, accident, life and accident, plate glass, and steam boiler insurance companies, and surety companies, shall pay an annual license fee, graded in proportion to its capital stock. Such associations are formed for the purpose of receiving and accumulating the contributions and deposits of its incubus, and loaning the same to its members, etc. The fact that the loans are made to its members does not relieve the corporation from any liability imposed by law. The corporation is an artificial person. created under authority of law, and wholly distinct from the mem- bers organizing it, and its business being the loaning of money for interest paid for its use and benefit, it certainly is doing business for profit, and should pay the annual license fee. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 10, 1903. Board of Public Building Commissioners, Salem, Oregon: GENTLEMEN: Since my communication of April 29, last, relative to contract with the Salem Flouring Mills Company et al., woulu say that on the 14th day of May, 1903, said corporation caused to be recorded a satisfaction of mortgage, in book 48, page 522, Ma- rion County Mortgage Records, releasing and satisfying in full the mortgage existing against the water right described in said con- tract. I have also further investigated the right of the Salem Consoli- dated Railway Company to use so much water as will flow through a four-inch pipe, and find that it is subject to the right of the Salem Flouring Mills Company to have all the water How to its mills, which are nearest the river, and the flouring mills company acquired such right in 1870, while the deed from the Salem Water Company to the street railway company is dated March 28, 1895. &quot; &quot;ReporT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 81 in the compilation of the laws relating to roads and highways, unless it is desired to show in such compilation all classes of per- sons exempt from road taxes, as the section referred to is a part of the Military Code of this State, and has never been enacted into the road laws. In 1901 the Legislative Assembly of the State of Oregon duly passed an act, House Bill 26, known as the Military Code, entitled “An act for the more efficient organization and discipline of the militia of the State of Oregon, and appropriating money therefor, and for the suppression of riots.&amp;quot; Said section 99 of the Military Code, page 212, laws of 1901, read as follows: “All active mem- bers of the Oregon National Guard are hereby declared exempt from all military, poll, or road tax, service on posse comitatus and jury duty, so long as they continue to be active members of the military organization of the State, and -after five years&apos; service shall be exempt frem further jury duty, and the Adjutant-General shall issue them a certificate to that effect.&amp;quot; At the same session of the legislature, an act was passed authorizing Hon. C. B. Bel- linger and W. W. Cotton to annotate, compile, and publish a re- vised edition of the Code and Laws of Oregon, which was done; said publication being completed in 1902. In said compilation, Messrs Bellinger and Cotton published said section 99 of the said Military Code twice; once as number 3263 of chapter 1 of title 31, the same being the Military Code, as enacted in 1901 as aforesaid, and where said section properly belongs. They again published said section as number 4832 of article 11 of chapter 10 of title 39, the same being part of the road laws of the State of Oregon. The following note appears in said code immediately after said sec- tion 4832, to wit: “For convenience this section is inserted as a part of the road law. It will also be found in the Military Code, of which it forms a part.&amp;quot; In 1903 the legislature duly enacted a revision of the road laws, and repealed, with other articles, articie 11 of chapter 10 of title 39, containing said section 4832. It will be observed that section 4832 is only a reprint of section 3263 of the Military Code, as the author says, for convenience, but such reprint dces not remove it from its true position and number as a part of the Military Code. It had never been enacted, con- sidered, or published as a part of the road laws, and being re. peated therein by the compilers of the code for convenience, did Att&apos;y. Gen. -6 &quot; &quot;*120 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. indicates the intention of the legislature not to tax estates under ten thousand dollars in value. Respectfully yours, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, July 14, 1903. Hon. F. I. DUNBAR, Secretary of State: DEAR SIR: In reference to your inquiry as to whether the claims of Indian War Veterans, under the act filed in your office February 24, 1903, are claims incurred in pursuance of authority of law in the purview of section 2389 of B. &amp;amp; C. Comp. requiring the Sec- retary of State to audit the same, and issue a certificate as evidence of such allowance, I have, after an examination of the matter, come to the conclusion that the Secretary of State can not audit, much less draw warrants for the same. The Indian War Veterans&apos; act appropriates $100,000 to pay the veterans of the Indian Wars of 1855 and 1856, and the appropria- tion becomes exhausted before all are paid therefore no warrant can be drawn under section 2398 above referred to. To determine whether they can be audited, we must ascertain the meaning of the words, “Where such claim had been incurred in pursuance of au- thority of law,” as used in said section, and in the case of Shattuck v. Kincaid, 31 Or. at page 400, the court say: “It sometimes oc- curs, however, that special appropriations are made for a particular purpose, where the act itself authorizes the incurring of the ex- pense, and is the only warrant of law therefor. In such cases, of course, the measure of the appropriation is the limit of authority to obligate the State, and hence the Secretary could neither audit nor draw his warrant, because the claim is not one which the law would recognize as valid against the State.” Flynn v. Turner, 99 Mich, 96, cited supports the same view, and this being a special appropriation for a particular purpose, when it becomes exhausted the power of the Secretary of State, both to audit claims and to draw warrants under the act, is also exhausted. The legislature appropriated a certain amount to pay certain claims, and the &quot; &apos;184 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. by the United States to settlers under the various United States land laws, and the most of it a long time ago. While I have not been able to secure correct data, from the time it was settled upon under United States law, and a homestead or other filing placed thereon, Mr. Adair would be entitled to interest on the money he paid for that land, together with his principal. He is claiming on that land from the time he paid the twenty per centum, and I think it well to allow the claim, for we cannot well secure the exact dates the respective claims attached, and the title failed. I would advise payment of the principal, $876.97, and in- terest at five per cent. on $342.76 thereof from the date it was paid, and no interest on the balance. It is a little more than he would be entitled to receive, in my opinion, if exact data was at hand, but the difference would not be great, and it is difficult to secure the necessary information. Yours truly, A. M. CRAWFORD, Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, June 2. 1904. Hon. J. H. ACKERMAN, Superintendent of Public Instruction: DEAR SIR: Relative to yours of the 1st instant as to whether a person appointed to serve the unexpired term of school director has the same rights and privileges so far as the chairmanship of the board is concerned, as the person would have had whose place he was appointed to fill, permit me to say that subdivision 3 of section 48 of school laws of Oregon of 1903, the same being the latter part of section 3388 of B. &amp;amp; C. Code, provides that “the director who has served the longest time as such under an election shall act as chairman of district school, board meetings.&quot; Section 81 of school laws of 1903, page 65, provides that &quot;all provisions of this act concerning the duties and powers of the school directors and school clerks in districts other than of the first class, which do not conflict with the express provisions of this article, shall be considered to apply to the officers of districts of the first class.&quot; The article above referred to is the article concerning districts of the first class, and there is nothing in the same con- &apos; &quot;REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. 211 some machinery placed in the mill, the question of its adaptability to the purpose for which the mill is used would be pertinent. “Third, the intention of the party making the annexation, to make the article a permanent accession to the freehold, this inten- tion being inferred from the nature of the article affixed, the rela- tion and situation of the party making the annexation, the policy of the law in relation thereto, the structure and mode of the an- nexation and the purpose or use for which the annexation has been made.&amp;quot; This last will come nearer being applicable than either of the others, but we can not apply it unless we have all the facts and circumstances. We must know of what the improve- ments consist. If the person who secured title from the State for the land knew that these improvements were thereon, and that the land was in &apos;the possession of some one else, it might be evidence of fraud on his part, but if he had no knowledge of such facts and paid for the land in good faith, I am inclined to the opinion that he would hold the improvements, but of course the facts and nature of the improvements may give another color to the matter. I have cited the tests given by the Supreme Court, and the man will have to measure his rights thereby, as he knows all the facts. Respectfully, A. M. CRAWFORD. Attorney-General. OFFICE OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL. SALEM, Oregon, September 7, 1904. Hon. CHARLES S. MOORE, State Treasurer: DEAR SIR: I have examined the transcript in the case of State of Oregon v. R. Willett, from Justice&apos;s Court, Deer Creek Precinct, Douglas County, Oregon, for violation of the pure food law, rela- tive to whether the justice has warrant of law for deducting his costs from the fine assessed against and collected from the defen- dant. Defendant was adjudged guilty, and a fine of $25 imposed against him by the justice&apos;s court, under section 26 of Senate Bill No. 683, laws of 1901, page 264, which provides that any person violating any of the provisions of the act shall be punished by a &quot;</field>
